However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The ""pollination crisis"" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural acid agricultural ecosystems.",1998
The potential consequences of pollinator declines on the conservation of biodiversity and stability of food crop yields,,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; PLANT; FOREST; BATS; REPRODUCTION; POPULATION; FERTILITY; COSTS,"Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada come together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leaves us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollination may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans. (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on the wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the ""nectar corridors"" of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay, public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.",1998
Plant functional traits and environmental filters at a regional scale,Argentina; assembly rule; climatic gradient; climate change; trait-environment linkage; plant functional type,GROWTH-RATE; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY; RULES; CLASSIFICATION; ATTRIBUTES; SOIL; LEAF,"Links between plant traits and the environment, i.e. sets of plant attributes consistently associated with certain environmental conditions, are the consequence of the filtering effect of climatic, disturbance and biotic conditions. These filters determine which components of a species pool are assembled into local communities. We aimed at testing for consistent association between plant traits and climatic conditions along a steep regional gradient, divided into 13 climatically homogeneous sectors, in central-western Argentina. We analyzed 19 vegetative and regeneration traits of the 100 most abundant species along the gradient. For each trait, we tested for homogeneity of frequencies of different categories between sectors and the regional species pool, using the chi(2) statistic. We rejected H-0 in 71% of the pair-wise comparisons, which strongly suggests a 'filtering effect' of climatic factors on key plant functions. Vegetative traits were filtered more often than regeneration traits. Specific leaf area, life span, ramification, canopy height, leaf weight ratio, carbon investment into support tissue and pollination mode were the traits showing differences in the largest number of pair-wise comparisons. This is probably the first attempt to detect, on a quantitative, statistically conservative basis, consistent linkages between climatic factors and numerous plant traits, over a broad spectrum of environmental conditions and plant growth forms. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach in predicting vegetation structure and functioning under present environmental conditions, and those expected for the next century as a consequence of global change.",1998
Annual variability in seed production by woody plants and the masting concept: Reassessment of principles and relationship to pollination and seed dispersal,crop size; mast fruiting; pollination; seed dispersal; seed production,PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST; BETWEEN-YEAR VARIATION; RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE; FRUIT-CROP SIZE; REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PREDATOR SATIATION; FRAXINUS-EXCELSIOR; POLLEN LIMITATION,"By analyzing 296 published and unpublished data sets describing annual variation in seed output by 144 species of woody plants, this article addresses the following questions. Do plant species naturally fall into distinct groups corresponding to masting and nonmasting habits? Do plant populations generally exhibit significant bimodality in annual seed output! Are there significant relationships between annual variability in seed production and pollination and seed dispersal modes, as predicted from economy of scale considerations? We failed to identify distinct groups of species with contrasting levels of annual variability in seed output but did find evidence that most polycarpic woody plants seem to adhere to alternating supra-annual schedules consisting of either high or low reproduction years. Seed production was weakly more variable among wind-pollinated taxa than animal-pollinated ones. Plants dispersed by mutualistic frugivores were less variable than those dispersed by either inanimate means or animals that predominantly behave as seed predators. We conclude that there are no objective reasons to perpetuate the concept of mast fruiting in the ecological literature as a shorthand to designate a distinct biological phenomenon. Associations between supra-annual variability in seed output and pollination and seed dispersal methods suggest the existence of important reproductive correlates that demand further investigation.",1998
The taxonomic distribution of invasive angiosperm plants: Ecological insights and comparison to agricultural weeds,plant invaders; weeds; plant families; ecological characteristics; statistical trends,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; NATIONAL-PARK; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ECOSYSTEM; FORESTS,"Global data sets of serious agricultural weeds (1348 species), widespread agricultural weeds (1041 species), and threatening natural area invaders (381 species) were assembled, and taxonomic patterns among these data sets were compared to gain insights into how these groups differ ecologically. Angiosperm taxonomic groups (families, orders and subclasses) were tested for over-and under-representation using resampling tests, and ecological characteristics of plant families were correlated with the prominence of each family ill the data sets. As predicted by Baker's previously proposed attributes of 'ideal' weeds, many over-represented families among agricultural weeds contained primarily herbaceous, rapidly reproducing, abiotically dispersed species. The natural area invaders, in contrast, were represented by a more ecologically diverse range of families and were over-represented by more largely woody families. Families with at least some abiotically pollinated species averaged significantly higher proportions of natural area invaders (p=0.001) and agricultural weeds (p < 0.001) than biotically pollinated families. Families containing climbing species were more highly represented among natural area invaders than families without climbers (p<0.009). While all nonnative plants may carry some risk of becoming natural area invaders, this taxonomic analysis suggests that plants with amongst the highest risk of becoming natural area invaders worldwide include: species that are primarily aquatic or semi-aquatic, grasses, nitrogen-fixers, climbers, and clonal trees. Only 25% of natural area invaders were serious agricultural weeds, so quarantine legislation aimed at curbing the introduction of nerv agricultural weeds will be unlikely to prevent the introduction of most natural area invaders.

Bioindication using trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies: community structure and interactions,Apidae; diversity; fragmented habitats; Hymenoptera; parasitism,SET-ASIDE FIELDS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; NATURE CONSERVATION; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; POLLINATION; SUCCESSION; ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY,"1, Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tills or plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such reed-filled tins were exposed ill the target habitat. 2, Species richness and abundance of bees (but trot wasps) were closely related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees' food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species. 3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the predacious wasps. 4, With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation) declined significantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and field mal-gins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest habitat was 106-530 m for a 10 50% decrease in mean mortality, and the mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years. Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of old habitat patches for the augmentation of nat ural enemies. 5, Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known, and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system are discussed in the text.",1998
Sugar composition of nectars and fruits consumed by birds and bats in the tropics and subtropics,coevolution; Erythrina; fruit juice; hummingbirds; Megachiroptera; Microchiroptera; nectar; passerine; sucrose,FLORAL NECTAR; AMINO-ACIDS; NEW-ZEALAND; OLD-WORLD; CONSTITUENTS; POLLINATION; PREFERENCES; PHYLOGENIES; CHARACTERS; ADAPTATION,"Several characteristics of flowers and fruits have been suggested as comprising syndromes of characters that indicate particular classes of pollinators and fruit dispersers. Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinator/disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran Fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plane-animal interactions be anticipated.",1998

Organisation and diversity of tropical bat communities through space and time,guilds; resources; conservation; behavior; inventories,DIPTEROCARP RAIN-FOREST; FRUIT-EATING BATS; ECHOLOCATION CALLS; FRENCH-GUIANA; ARTIBEUS-JAMAICENSIS; INSECTIVOROUS BATS; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; FORAGING ECOLOGY; PHYLLOSTOMIDAE,"Tropical bat communities are characterized by high species diversity and relative abundance. Due to their diverse feeding ecologies, bats play indispensable roles in tropical forests as seed dispersers, pollinators, and predators of arthropods. However, despite of their importance, little is known about factors that promote diversity in this taxon as well as interactions between bats and their environment. First results suggest that Neotropical bat communities are highly structured. I explore factors that may contribute to the observed pattern. Partitioning of resources in space and time facilitates coexistence of species within local species assemblages. I discuss future perspectives for comprehensive studies of species assemblages that combine macroecological (top-down) and microecological (bottom-up) approaches. Foremost, I underline the need for comprehensive inventory techniques. In conclusion, comparative community studies of bats with standardized methodologies are crucial for a better understanding how environmental change may influence these species assemblages and in turn, plants and animals affected by them.",1998
Ecological knowledge of regeneration from seed in neotropical forest trees: Implications for natural forest management,seed dispersal; natural forest management; pollination; phenology; logging; hunting; neotropics; seed trees; tropical forest,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; MONKEYS ALOUATTA-SENICULUS; BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; FRENCH-GUIANA; TREEFALL GAPS; COSTA-RICA; VOUACAPOUA-AMERICANA; VIROLA-SURINAMENSIS; DISPERSAL DISTANCE; UNDERSTORY BIRDS,"We discuss the main ecological factors that influence tree recruitment in neotropical moist- and wet forests within the context of timber management based on selective logging. We argue that setting aside protection areas in managed forests as a way to preserve ecological processes may not be sufficient to ensure sustainable levels of tree regeneration, and that a thorough understanding and application of tree seed ecology can help to refine management prescriptions. We review relevant aspects of tree reproductive biology seed production and dispersal, spatial and temporal constraints on seed availability, disperser behavior, and the potential consequences of hunting and forest fragmentation on tree regeneration, and discuss their implications for biological sustainability in managed forests. Tree seed production can be influenced by the selective removal of neighbors of the same species (due to insufficient pollen transfer), flowering asynchrony, and attributes of the species' sexual system. The extent to which an area is supplied by seed can be affected by dispersal mechanism, spatio-temporal limitations to seed dispersal, and tree size-dependent levels of seed production at the species level. Studies of vertebrate-disperser behavior and tree seed deposition in logged forests are scarce and warrant further attention in order to refine our understanding of the dependency of sustained timber production on vertebrate fauna. Although much remains to be learned about tree seed ecology in neotropical logged forests, the baseline information presented here may offer a starting point for developing ecological criteria for seed tree retention. Furthermore, it may contribute in improving ecologically-based management prescriptions in order to enhance or at least maintain sufficient levels of natural regeneration without the need to rely on artificial regeneration.

Diet selection and resource use by flying foxes (Genus Pteropus),feeding strategies; flying foxes; flying foxes as keystone species; flying fox feeding strategies; foraging theories; island vs. mainland comparisons; plant-animal interactions; Pteropus samoensis; Pteropus tonganus; resource use calculated using a preference index; Samoa,RAIN-FOREST; SAMOA; BATS; PTEROPODIDAE; POLLINATION; ECOSYSTEMS; CHIROPTERA; PREDATION; ISLANDS; ECOLOGY,"Flying foxes of the genus Pteropus (Pteropodidae: Chiroptera) play important roles as pollinators and seed dispersers in oceanic-island forest communities. This research examined general theories of diet breadth, diet selection, and the evolution of feeding strategies in bats in light of information from members of the genus Pteropus that inhabit oceanic islands. The feeding ecology of two species of flying fox, Pteropus samoensis and Pteropus tonganus on the Samoan archipelago, was examined in detail by direct observation and by examining feeding refuse. P. samoensis and P. tonganus fed on over 78 plant species from 39 families throughout their range and on over 69 plant species in Samoa alone. Flying foxes interacted with 59% of the forest tree species in Amalau Valley for fruit or flower resources. Twenty-eight percent of the forest trees were commonly used, and 79% of forest canopy trees were used. Broad overlap in resource use was noted between P. samoensis and P. tonganus with over 22 shared plant species. Seasonal variation in fruit resource use was quantified with a preference index. Flying foxes ate a taxonomically nonrandom subset of fruit species and generally preferred primary forest fruits to those in the secondary forest. Six plant families (Sapotaceae, Mrytaceae, Moraceae, Combretaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae) were particularly important to flying foxes in Samoa. However, a set of core plant taxa does not exist for Pteropus spp, in Samoa. Differences in the evolution of feeding strategies between mainland fruit-eating chiroptera and island species likely reflect differences in the spatio-temporal availability of resources in the two systems.",1998
Does self-pollination provide reproductive assurance in Aquilegia canadensis (Ranunculaceae)?,Aquilegia canadensis; autogamy; delayed self-fertilization; dichogamy; floral morphology; herkogamy; plant mating systems; protogyny; Ranunculaceae,MIMULUS-GUTTATUS SCROPHULARIACEAE; CROSS-FERTILIZATION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; PLANTS; ANGIOSPERMS; AUTOGAMY; MODES,"The ability to produce seeds when pollinators or potential mates are scarce is thought to be one of the main advantages of self-fertilization in flowering plants. However, whether autonomous selfing increases seed set in natural populations has seldom been tested, and even fewer studies have evaluated the advantage of selfing across a gradient of pollen availability. This study examines the fertility consequences of autonomous selfing in Aquilegia canadensis (Ranunculaceae), a short-lived, spring-flowering perennial typically found in small, patchy populations on rock outcrops. We used a pollinator exclusion experiment to confirm reports that A. canadensis has a well-developed capacity for autonomous selfing resulting from incomplete protogyny and close proximity of stigmas and anthers during dehiscence. Flowers excluded from pollinators set 87% as many seeds per carpel (X +/- 1 SE = 7.1 +/- 1.4 seeds) as hand-pollinated flowers (8.1 +/- 1.3 seeds), and seed production in unpollinated flowers correlated negatively with the distance between stigmas and anthers (r = -0.46). Autonomous selfing could be potentially valuable in providing reproductive assurance because only 2.7 +/- 0.5 pollen grains were deposited on each stigma before anther dehiscence, compared to 134.1 +/- 17.9 pollen grains by the end of anther dehiscence. However, prevention of autonomous selfing by anther removal before dehiscence did not decrease seed set, even for plants at low plant densities where outcross pollen may have been in short supply. Emasculated flowers set as many seeds per carpel (9.3 +/- 0.9) as intact flowers (8.4 +/- 1.1), indicating that sufficient cross pollen is deposited for full seed set. These results do not support the hypothesis that autonomous selfing by A. canadensis has been selected because it provides reproductive assurance.",1998
Relationships between population and habitat characteristics and reproduction of the rare Gentiana pneumonanthe L.,,CAERULEA L MOENCH; SEED-SET; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; GENETIC CONSEQUENCES; OVULE ABORTION; SIZE; FRAGMENTATION; COMPETITION; NETHERLANDS; FITNESS,"We investigated the relationships among a number of population and site characteristics and the ovule and seed production and seed set in 17 populations of the rare, self-compatible, bumblebee-pollinated perennial Gentiana pneumonanthe L. in the Netherlands. Population size and offspring heterozygosity were used as population properties; grass and heath cover, soil concentrations of various ions, soil acidity (pH), and soil moisture were used as habitat characteristics. Our aim was to find out how important population size and genetic variation are for the seed production of a rare plant, when accounting for a number of habitat parameters that might also be important for successful reproduction. Correlation coefficients between population and habitat characteristics showed that sites with low soil moisture and higher concentration of most nutrients have a higher cover of grasses and a low cover of heath species. At such sites the population size of G. pneumonanthe was small and offspring heterozygosity was low. The number of ovules per fruit (a component of reproductive effort) was negatively associated with heterozygosity, phosphorus, and pH and positively associated with calcium, potassium, SO(4), NH(4), and electric conductivity. Total vegetation cover correlated positively with the variation in ovule production among individuals. Seed set and number of viable seeds per fruit, indicators of the success of fertilization and seed maturation, correlated positively with population size, the cover of co-flowering heath species, and the same group of nutrients that (independently) had a positive effect on ovule on ovule production. A high NO(2) concentration might be toxic because it had a negative effect on the number of viable seeds. Seed weight seemed to be independent of any population or habitat parameter. Besides lower mean values, we also found more variation in reproductive success among individuals in smaller populations. We conclude that plants in small populations of G. pneumonanthe have a similar reproductive potential per flower but have lower seed production and a higher uncertainty of successful reproduction than plants in large populations. Genetic variation was apparently not very important. In addition to population size, habitat characteristics also seemed to be important for seed production and seed set. The most important factors were the facilitating effect of the presence of other insect-pollinated species and the concentrations of specific nutrients in the soil. To restore small populations, we advise small-scale sod cutting around the remaining reproductive individuals. This simultaneously allows germination and seedling establishment of G. pneumonanthe, removes soil nutrients, and restores the cover of pollinator-attracting heath species at the cost of grasses.",1998
Origin of hummingbird faunas,Andes; West Indies; DNA hybridization; North America; Trochilidae; tropical,NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS; COMMUNITY; ORGANIZATION; ECOLOGY; COEVOLUTION; POLLINATION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; FLOWERS; AVES,"Ecological studies of hummingbird communities have emphasized die importance of local conditions and contemporary interactions in the development of these varied faunas. A time-calibrated, DNA hybridization-based phylogeny of the principal hummingbird lineages was used to examine historical aspects of hummingbird faunas in the species-rich tropical lowlands and Andes, and the relatively depauperate West Indies and temperate regions of Central and North America. Parsimony reconstructions of ancestral distributions indicate that these faunas are polyphyletic in origin, comprising several to many independent lineages. Based on the timing of geologic and cladogenic events, hummingbird faunas appear to have arisen more often by colonization than by large-scale vicariance, with multiple dispersals across water gaps, elevational gradients, and latitude. The extent to which particular lineages colonized different regions depended, however, on lineage ecology as well as on the habitat and age of the fauna. In general, the oldest extant trochilofauna, which today occupies the tropical lowlands, was the principal source of colonizing taxa. However, all regions except possibly the West Indies contributed taxa now found elsewhere, including in the tropical lowlands. The Andean fauna comprises several lineages with lowland origin (hermits, Mangoes, Brilliants, Coquettes? Emeralds) as well as at least one that arose in temperate regions outside South America (Bees). At least two lineages that colonized the West Indies gave rise to endemic genera (Mangoes to Eulampis, and Emeralds to Orthorhyncus). Even groups that diversified in the highlands (Brilliants and Bees) Save rise to taxa that subsequently reinvaded the tropical lowlands. As the result of these varied histories, hummingbird communities cannot be arranged easily with respect to organizational complexity and coevolution with nectar sources. Although the physically insular faunas in the Andes and West Indies differ markedly in diversity, both were more strongly affected by colonization than the other faunas. A high potential for coevolution between hummingbirds and plants probably facilitated the successful establishment and radiation of the several Andean-associated lineages. However, coexistence between the two most diverse Andean clades may have been favoured initially through different habitat preferences by their extra-Andean ancestors. In the tropical lowlands, by comparison, the basic separation between the forest-dwelling hermits and canopy and edge-dwelling nonhermits appears to have evolved in situ. The low species and morphologic diversity of hummingbirds breeding north of Mexico reflects the predominance there of a single relatively recent lineage. The regional coexistence of numerous unrelated lineages implies that patterns of ancestry, colonization, and extinction contribute to the make-up of contemporary species-rich hummingbird faunas and serves to qualify the view that hummingbird communities are coadapted assemblages that resist change.",1998
Causes and consequences of mast seed production of four co-occurring Carpinus species in Japan,Carpinus; masting; Ogawa Forest Reserve; pollination efficiency; predator satiation; synchronized fruiting,TEMPERATE DECIDUOUS FOREST; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PREDATOR SATIATION; FAGUS-SILVATICA; QUERCUS-ROBUR; POLLINATION; BEECH; TREES; OAKS; DEMOGRAPHY,"To test two hypotheses for mast fruiting, i.e., (1) pollination efficiency and (2) pre-dispersal predator satiation, we investigated annual fluctuation in seed production and demography From flower to seed of four Carpinus species (family Betulaceae). We monitored flowering, seed production, and seed fall for seven years (1987-1993) for Carpinus laxiflora, C., tschonoskii, C. japonica, and C. cordata, which co occur in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa a Forest Reserve, central Japan. We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production, Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, reeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period, The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also supports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species, Lf the four species have common seed predators (possibly some curculionid species), mutually synchronized fluctuation of seed production among them would be effective for escaping from pre-dispersal predation.",1998

We test whether constancy occurs in an overlooked group of pollinators, the syrphid flies. Foraging sequences of wild flies of two species, Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii, were examined when visiting flowers in seminatural plant communities and in artificial arrays of two color morphs of Lobularia maritima planted at a range of frequencies. Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located in most flowers they visit.",1998

Family variation in annual needlefall amounts was significant during the fourth (from 4796 to 6191 kg ha(-1)) and fifth growing seasons (from 4717 to 5721 kg ha(-1)); needlefall patterns for the poorest performing family were asynchronous from those of the others, with notably higher needlefall rates from April to July. Estimates of ANPP at age 4 yr varied by 16% (from 32.9 to 38.2 Mg ha(-1)) among families, and were generally commensurate with progeny test rankings based on height growth, The relationship between ANPP and leaf area index (LAI) was both significant and curvilinear, with an apparent optimum level of production (42.6 Mg ha(-1)) achieved at a LAI of about 13 (all-sided; February), The least productive families had the lowest mean LAI (e.g., 7.9), while the most productive families generally had higher levels of LAI (e.g., 13.6). Significant family differences in canopy light interception were present in every month sampled except June, when photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception exceeded 90% for all families. Light extinction coefficients (k) for February differed significantly among the five families, and ranged from 0.28 to 0.38; families with the largest LAIs generally had the lowest values of k and the highest levels of PAR interception. A strong linear relationship (r(2)=0.74) was found between ANPP and intercepted PAR, Estimates of the dry matter:radiation quotient (epsilon; ""radiation use efficiency"") differed significantly among families, and ranged from 1.33 g MJ(-1) to 1.48 g MJ(-1). Results of this study suggest that fundamental differences exist in production ecology among loblolly pine families, and that canopy-level characteristics such as LAI, PAR interception, and ""radiation use efficiency"" are important in conferring differential family performance.",1998

Seed from three populations in the southern Appalachians (Tennessee, South Carolina, GA) were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi (Epulorhiza spp.) in vitro; seed germination and protocorm (seedling) developmental stages were evaluated up to 1 year after sowing. Seed obtained from Tennessee and South Carolina populations had a significantly higher percent germination (76.4 and 81.5%, respectively) than those collected from Georgia (16.2%); however, the Georgia population yielded more advanced seedlings suitable for soil transfer. A single fungal isolate (E. inquilina) originally obtained from the roots of P. clavellata, promoted advanced seedling development; three other isolates from additional Platanthera taxa (P. ciliaris, P. cristata, P. integrilabia), were ineffective. The ecological role of this orchid with its associated fungi is discussed with respect to the other co-habiting Platanthera species. ",1998
Evolution of intermediate selfing rates in plants: pollination ecology versus deleterious mutations,dominance; inbreeding depression; mutation rate; pollination; self-fertilization,MIXED MATING SYSTEMS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; OUTCROSSING RATES; HERMAPHRODITE PLANTS; CROSS-FERTILIZATION; SELECTION; POPULATIONS; MODELS; FITNESS; REPRODUCTION,"The evolutionarily stable rate of self-fertilzation is studied in phenotypic models that incorporate pollination ecology as well as the correlated evolution of inbreeding depression and the population mean selfing rate. Inbreeding depression is assumed to be caused by continual mutation to deleterious, partially recessive alleles. Several mutation rates and dominance levels are included. Two separate ecological cases are studied: how selfing rate affects proportion of ovules fertilized (pollination assurance, seed discounting) and how selfing rate affects male outcrossing success through pollen discounting. Evolutionarily stable rates are invariably zero or intermediate in two circumstances, namely when increased selfing causes (1) a decrease in the proportion of ovules fertilized or (2) an increase in pollen discounting and, therefore, a disproportionate decrease in male outcrossing success. Complete selfing is stable when selfing increases the proportion of ovules fertilized for all selfing rates. Stable selfing is zero or one in cases where the selfing rate has no effect on the proportion of ovules fertilized or when pollen discounting does not increase with selfing. Higher inbreeding depression tends to decrease the optimal selfing rate, and lower inbreeding depression (higher dominance coefficients and lower mutation rates) is more favorable to the existence of stable intermediate selfing rates. Approaches such as this that explicitly incorporate the interdependence of selfing, ovule fertilization, and male outcrossing may help explain the persistence of intermediate selfing rates in animal-pollinated plants.",1998
Early Permian insect folivory on a gigantopterid-dominated riparian flora from north-central Texas,diet; trophic analysis; herbivorous taxa; Insecta; Plantae; Permian; paleoecology,ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; FOSSIL RECORD; HERBIVORY; DEFENSE; HISTORY; GROWTH; PLANTS; FOREST,"Quantitative analysis of 11,562 cm(2) of foliar surface area from an Early Permian flora from north-central Texas reveals that 2.6% was removed by insect folivores. Of the 1346 foliar items analyzed, 31.8% were attacked by insect folivores. This Permian insect herbivory approximated one-third the level in modern tropical to temperate forests. Three taxa of Gigantopteridaceae exhibited disproportionately high insect consumption levels, ranging from 3.1 to 4.4% of leaf area, and attack frequencies of 39.6 to 82.8% - levels comparable to taxon-specific values for modem woody dicotyledonous angiosperms. Qualitative analysis of folivory type also indicates that five of the eight categories of herbivore damage occurring on this flora were confined to or overwhelmingly represented on Gigantopteridaceae, suggesting preferential host specificity for Gigantopteridaceae by insect folivores. By contrast, other pteridophylls, conifers, cycadophytes, and two taxa of uncertain affinity, showed low levels of leaf area removal and attack frequencies. The Gigantopteridaceae, an enigmatic group of Permian plants with large, megaphyllous foliage, foreshadowed physiognomic attributes occurring in later angiosperms. Both groups had similar consumption patterns and intensities by insect folivores. Ln this moderately diverse Early Permian flora, insect folivory was significant, at least in one riparian environment outside the Euramerican coal-swamp ecosystem, indicating that modern modes and magnitudes of insect consumption of vascular plant tissue were in place during the Late Paleozoic.

Nectar sugars in Proteaceae: Patterns and processes,,SOUTH-AFRICAN; POLLINATION; EVOLUTION,"The nectar sugar composition is presented for 147 species from 16 genera of South African and Australian Proteaceae. Patterns associated with flower age, different plants and populations, plant phylogeny and pollination have been examined. In addition to the usual three nectar sugars (sucrose, fructose and glucose), the nectar of Protea and Faurea contains the pentose sugar xylose at concentrations of up to 39% of total sugar. Xylose has not previously been reported from floral nectar and is absent from the nectar of Adenanthos, Banksia, Brabejum, Dryandra, Grevillea, Hakea, Lambertia, Leucospemtum, Macadamia, Mimetes, Orothamnus, Paranomus, Stenocarpus and Telopea. Most genera and species have hexose-dominant nectar, but within the large genera Banksia, Grevillea, Leucospermum and Protea some of the seemingly more derived species have sucrose-dominant nectar. This interesting dichotomy of low versus high sucrose is of diagnostic value at the species level and indicative of phylogenetic relationships within the larger genera. At the generic level, the presence of xylose is a convincing synapomorphy for Protea and Faurea. Studies of physiological processes (e.g. enzyme activities) and ecological processes (e.g. pollination) may help to explain some of the conservative and taxonomically interesting nectar sugar patterns.",1998
Comparison of the biodiversity of Lepidoptera within three forested ecosystems,Lepidoptera; abundance; biodiversity; food webs; forest ecosystem; species richness,CONIFEROUS FORESTS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; HERBIVORY; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; INSECTS,"Lepidopterans function in the dynamics of forested ecosystems by serving as defoliators, decomposers, prey or hosts to carnivores, and pollinators. The biodiversity of Lepidoptera is thus linked into the ecosystem by influencing nutrient cycling, plant population dynamics, and predator-prey population dynamics. Two important measures of biodiversity are species richness and abundance of individuals. However, values for these measures require an ecosystem context for insightful interpretation of ecological function. We propose that such an ecosystem context is gained by an assessment of host resource requirements; in the case of Lepidoptera, this means larval host plants. The nora that contributes to the biodiversity of Lepidoptera can be grouped into 3 major vegetation types: (1) conifers, (2) hardwood trees and shrubs, and (3) herbs and grasses. We compared the macrolepidopteran biodiversity of 3 forested ecosystems: (1) western Oregon, (2) eastern Oregon, and (3) West Virginia. In respective order of the above locations, totals of 463, 385, and 475 species were found. Conifers supported 9: 10, and 1% of the species richness. By contrast, hardwoods supported 57, 45, and 61% of the species richness, whereas herbs and grasses supported 31, 42, and 31% of the species richness. The patterns in abundance of individual moths were different from species richness of moths and butterflies considered together. Comparisons of moth abundance showed conifers supported 18, 5, and 1%; hardwoods supported 69, 39, and 77%; and herbs and grasses supported 11, 55, and 8%. Practices involved in the management of forested ecosystems are discussed in the context of how Lepidoptera may be used as an indicator taxon for the assessment of land management practices, and how biodiversity of Lepidoptera could be considered in plans for habitat restoration with a specific focus on food web relationships.",1998
"Flowering, fruiting and seed germination in Chilean rain forest myrtaceae: ecological and phylogenetic constraints",Chiloe; plant-animal mutualism; pollination ecology; seed dispersal; seed dormancy; temperate forest,TROPICAL FOREST; DELAYED GERMINATION; DISPERSAL; PHENOLOGY; COMPETITION; TREES; POLLINATORS; CHILOE; ADAPTATION; COMMUNITY,"Phenological studies in plant communities have generally focused on taxonomically heterogeneous species assemblages, and have only occasionally examined the evolutionary and ecological constraints on the phenological patterns of species within a single family or a genus. Here, we determine relative importance of phylogenetic versus other constraints on the flowering and fruiting periods of 12 species and the germination ecology of 10 species of Myrtaceae sympatric to the temperate rainforest of Isla Grande de Chiloe (42 degrees 30' S), in southern Chile. We found that, for most species in the family Myrtaceae, flowering was strongly aggregated in January and February. Although this pattern is consistent with the expectation of the 'facilitation' hypothesis (i.e., interspecific overlaps are maximized to attract pollinators), available evidence suggests that pollinators, mainly hymenopterans and dipterans, do not limit fruit production in these species of Myrtaceae in the temperate rainforest. In contrast to flowering, fruiting occurred all-year-round, showing greater segregation in time among the species. According to the their temporal patterns of fruit ripening, two functional groups were defined within the Myrtaceae: those that ripen their fruits immediately after flowering (species in the subtribe Myrtinae) and those in which green fruit develops slowly for several months before ripening (subtribe Myrciinae). Seed germination in the field occurred mainly between August and October. Lab assays showed that the species of Myrtaceae, subtribe Myrtinae, exhibited a long seed dormancy (>40 days), while the seeds of species in the subtribe Myrciinae often germinated within one week after harvesting. The analysis of the phenology of reproductive events in the species of Myrtaceae in this rainforest suggests that: (1) flowering periods patterns are constrained mainly by phylogenetic inertia at the family level, and (2) differences in fruiting patterns and dormancy periods are determined mainly by fruit and seed size, which in turn are associated primarily with phylogenetic closeness within the family, and secondarily with the activity of vertebrate seed dispersers.",1998
The effect of sperm competition on male gain curves in a colonial marine invertebrate,ascicium; Botryllis schlosseri; ecology; fertilization ecology; hermaphroditism; local adabtion; male gain curve; paternity; sex allocation,ASCIDIAN BOTRYLLUS-SCHLOSSERI; MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION; FERTILIZATION SUCCESS; SEX ALLOCATION; GENE FLOW; SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITISM; CELLEPORELLA-HYALINA; POPULATION-DENSITY; POLLINATED PLANTS,"The shape of the function that describes the relationship between resource allocation to sperm production and resulting male fertilization success (the male gain curve) plays a central role in models of sex allocation in hermaphrodites. A variety of ecological factors are expected to affect the shape of this function. Although male gain curves and male allocation patterns have been assayed in a variety of different organisms, there have been few attempts to determine whether the shape of the gain curve changes with ecological conditions. I assayed male gain curves in experimental populations of a colonial ascidian in which I manipulated the intensity of sperm competition to test the hypothesis that gain curves would saturate in the absence of competitors, but remain linear when males competed for fertilizations. Allozyme markers were utilized for paternity assignment. Results supported theoretical predictions, with the gain curve becoming progressively more linear as the intensity of sperm competition increased. Increased levels of sperm competition also had the: effect of decreasing male fertilization success at all sperm production levels. These results have a number of evolutionary implications. First, the existence of a saturating gain curve under some experimental conditions provides support for the hypothesis that diminishing gains in fertilization success via male function may favor the evolution of hermaphroditism. Secondly, the changing shape of this function with ecological conditions suggests that increased allocation to sperm production should be favored in high-density populations, where sperm competition is more intense. Finally, since male fertilization success only continued to increase with sperm production when competitors were present, this suggests that high levels of sperm production in some free-spawning marine invertebrates may be in part due to the selective pressures imposed on allocation patterns by sperm competition.",1998

Here we show host specificity in a rare orchid and describe other potential causes of host specificity. Lepanthes caritensis occurs only in Carite State Forest, Puerto Rico. We found L. caritensis only on the largest individuals of one species of tree, Micropholis guyanensis, limiting the orchid to only 7% of the potential tree community >5 cm dbh. Orchid occurrence was associated with high moss cover on M. guyanensis. The abundance of undescribed fungi cultured from tree bark was negatively associated with orchid presence. Low fruit production in orchids is not uncommon, but reproductive success in L, caritensis appeared to be unusually low; no fruits were produced by 68 adults during 16 months of observation. If this trend of low reproductive success is borne out over time, it would suggest an obvious explanation for the rarity of L. caritensis. Our results suggest ways to manage populations of L. caritensis, but also reveal aspects of tropical orchid biology (e.g. the importance of fungi and mosses for orchid establishment) which require more thorough investigation.

The adaptive surface in ecology,,RANDOM GENETIC DRIFT; NATURAL-SELECTION; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION; PEAK SHIFTS; CHARACTERS; POLLINATION; ADAPTATION,"We review the adaptive surface as it applies to the kinds of continuously varying traits studied in ecology and behaviour. The adaptive surface is a plot of the mean fitness of a population against the mean phenotype, and can be used to predict directions of evolution. Under frequency-independent selection the mean phenotype of a population evolves to an equilibrium position near a peak in the adaptive surface. However, under other forms of selection, peaks in the adaptive surface often do not coincide with evolutionary equilibria. Even when selection does drive a population toward peaks, the peaks may bear little relationship to measures of population ""fitness"", such as population size. Nevertheless the concept of an adaptive surface is heuristically useful because shifts between alternative locally stable states are likely to be a common mechanism of evolution. Furthermore, modelling peak shifts using the frequency-independent case indicates how easily different kinds of evolutionary transitions can occur. Theoretical models of peak shifts indicate that they most easily occur in response to the fluctuating selection pressures associated with environmental change, and are very unlikely to occur in response to genetic drift. Other mechanisms of peak shifts include environmental induction and mutations of large effect. The measurement of adaptive surfaces in nature is becoming increasingly common, although typically the individual fitness function rather than the true adaptive surface is measured, and frequency dependence is ignored. We suggest that more attention needs to be paid to the distinction between the individual fitness function, the adaptive surface, and the positions of evolutionary equilibria. If this is done, the value of the general concept will increase, and mechanisms of evolutionary transitions become further clarified.",1998
Does the recently introduced bumblebee Bombus terrestris (Apidae) threaten Australian ecosystems?,competition; foraging profile; introduced species; pollinators,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; BANKSIA-SPINULOSA; BEES; FLOWERS; COMPETITION; HYMENOPTERA; ENERGETICS; POLLEN; TEMPERATURE; HONEYBEES,"Native vegetation near Hobart in Tasmania was investigated to determine whether it was being invaded by the recently introduced large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758). This species was found to be established in high numbers in a variety of vegetation types from coastal heath, through sclerophyll forest, and subalpine shrubberies up to an altitude of 1100 m. Hence, it has the potential to spread through much of Tasmania and temperate, mesic regions of mainland Australia. It is highly polylectic, foraging on at least 66 native plant species from 21 families. While the most heavily visited species produced abundant nectar, the lack of predation on this species also allowed it to forage economically on small flowers in clusters. This foraging profile overlapped with those of all anthophilous insect families, all bee subgenera, and all species of nectarivorous birds which were encountered. Therefore, B. terrestris has the potential to compete with most native anthophiles and commercial honeybees. As it forages from some plant taxa which are not visited by the European honeybee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, this species is impacting on plant-pollinator relationships which have previously been free from the effects of exotic bees.",1998
The roles of ants as flower visitors: experimental analysis in three alpine plant species,,NECTAR-THIEVING ANTS; POLLINATION; POLLEN; MAINTENANCE; SEX; EVOLUTION; COMMUNITY; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; DIOECY,"I investigated three co-occurring North American alpine plant species for which ants comprise at least 20% of the flower visitors. Ants of the species Formica neorufibarbis gelida pollinate gynodioecious Paronychia pulvinata, are herbivores of the gynodioecious Eritrichum aretioides and appear to have little effect on the hermaphroditic Oreoxis alpina. Given that floral nectar and lipids are important resources for alpine ants, the effect of all three plant species on the ants is positive. In E. aretioides, ants chew on the coronal ring of flowers but are unlikely to contact the stigmas, explaining their negative effects on seed production. In ant-pollinated P. pulvinata, ants affect pollination in females more than in hermaphrodites. Single ant visits to unpollinated pistillate flowers show that ants are inefficient pollinators, transferring no pollen (viable or inviable) to stigmas 55% of the time. This result is probably explained by low pollen loads and infrequent movement between plants. In contrast, single ant visits to previously unpollinated perfect flowers on hermaphrodites produce seed-set similar to that in flowers open to pollination. In O. alpina, the lack of an effect of ants on seed production is probably explained by autogamous seed-set and lack of pollen limitation. In both gynodioecious species, E. aretioides and P. pulvinata, female plants produce more seeds than hermaphrodites in the absence of ants, but this difference is magnified when ants are allowed access to plants, suggesting that ants can influence the evolutionary maintenance of breeding system dimorphism in these species.",1998
"Remarkable nectaries: structure, ecology, organophyletic perspectives - II. Nectarioles",nectary; idioblasts; Calycanthaceae; Piperaceae; Cabomba; Aristolochia; Sarracenia; Cephalotus; Irlbachia,NYMPHAEACEAE SENSU LATO; BRASENIA-SCHREBERI; CABOMBA-CAROLINIANA; PIPER PIPERACEAE; FLORAL BIOLOGY; SARRACENIACEAE; PLANTS,"In the present, second part of a series of contributions dealing with unusual nectaries, certain nectarial glands occurring in seven unrelated families are described and characterized as nectarioles. This term denotes anatomically heterogeneous, few-celled, glandular modules or idioblasts displayed singly or in clusters on the surface of flowers (producing nuptial nectar) or on vegetative organs (producing extranuptial nectar). Structural equivalents of floral nectarioles in the green parts may yield other kinds of secretions. The nectar secreted by the tepals of Chimonanthus praecox (Calycanthaceae) originates from small, loosely aggregated, but disconnected units. Each unit consists of an assemblage of glandular cells arranged around a single stomatal sap-hole. The descendance of these nectarioles from stomatal hydathodes, as found in the magnoliid alliance, and their hypothetical role as elementary modules leading to more advanced, complex nectaries in evolution is discussed. Remarks on food tissue in nectarless Sinocalycanthus chinensis are appended. Similar, more voluminous nectarioles are distributed over the limb of the kettle-trap flower of Aristolochia melastoma. Being involved in floral attraction, they differ functionally from the trichomatous nectary inside the newer's utriculus, which is designed to provide subsistence to pollinators during their captivity. The extranuptial, calycinal nectaries of Irlbachia (Gentianaceae) are aggregations of numerous glandular cell-tetrads. The individual gland is surrounded by 4-8 subsidiary cells and drained via a central channel and pore. Its architecture and development resemble the salt-excreting epidermal Licopoli glands typical of the Plumbaginaceae and relatives. In parallel to certain other insectivorous families. Sarracenia (the only genus possessing nectar flowers in the Sarraceniaceae) incorporates a multitude of small epidermal glands into the flower in lieu of a conventional floral nectary, which it lacks. The individual nectarioles, seated in the ovary wall, represent a more luxuriant variant of the basically 14-celled gland type that yields nectar in the pitcher sphere to lure prey and probably serves as hydathode in most of the remaining green parts. The glands distributed over nearly all aerial parts of Cephalotus follicularis (Cephalotaceae) share a common basic construction and are known to be nearly identical with those of Sarracenia. They produce extranuptial nectar on the floral bracts and on the pitcher. The remaining glands outside the pitchers are assumed to be active as hydathodes in early development, while the function of the two major size classes of glands inside the pitchers remains uncertain. Cephalotus has a nuptial nectary. Forming a contiguous perigynous disk, the gland is unrelated to the vegetative type. Its peculiar pincushion-like appears ance rests on the presence of numerous pillars, each of which bears an apical stomatal sap-hole. The 4-celled glands forming dense aggregations on the surface of the nectarogeneous tepal auricles of Cabomba (Cabombaceae) are homologous to the trichomes of the submersed green parts. These are common also in other Nymphaeales and known to produce slime or to be involved in ion exchange. The glands of the auricles are supplied by a contiguous, glandular mesenchyma and appear to be the sites of active nectar secretion. Nectar production, so far unknown in the Piperaceae, was found in the flower spikes of Peperomia magnoliifolia and P. obtusifolia. Exploitation by ants and dipterans was observed in the greenhouse. Nectarioles, sunken in pits and comprised of a few glandular hairs, are located amidst each peltate bract. The trichomes are anatomical equivalents of hydathode hairs that are active in growing organs and widerspread in the family. Entomophily in Piper is confirmed, but an earlier suggestion that the floral bracts of the subgenus Ottonia are nectariferous was not substantiated.",1998
Changing travel-mode choice as rational choice: Results from a longitudinal intervention study,evaluation of a traffic policy measure; rational choice and ecologically relevant behaviours; theory of planned behaviour; travel mode choice,,"In this paper we report the results of a regional intervention study aimed at changing students' choice of the means of transportation by introducing a reduced fare semester ticket. First, we discuss and expand the concept of theory driven evaluation and relate it to the rational-actor theory used. The empirical results show that reduced cost produced by the intervention has a significant effect on behaviour but that this effect is mediated by attitudes toward the behaviour (preferences) and by perceived restrictions. Furthermore, the social process inherent in the intervention (polling of all students and mass media reports) also seemed to produce changes in the subjective norms. By using a structural equation model with latent means for two panel waves we have explicitly modelled the postulated set of propositions consisting of the substantive theory, the measurement model, and the action theory underlying the intervention. The results furnish complex insights on how the intervention was mediated by the constructs of a rational-actor theory-the theory of planned behaviour. Besides the significance of the variability of the price of public transportation for this population, the structural equation model yields information about the way attitudes, norms, subjectively perceived restrictions, intentions and behaviour itself are influenced. Furthermore, we can evaluate the stability of the constructs over time, allowing for both random and non-random measurement error.",1998

By incorporating the ecological structure of life histories and populations into analyses of the coevolutionary process, these studies are indicating that coevolutionary change is much more ecologically dynamic than indicated by earlier work. Rather than simply a slow, stately process shaping species over long periods of time, parts of the coevolutionary process may proceed rapidly (sometimes observable in less than a decade), continually molding and remolding populations and communities locally and over broad geographic scales.",1998
On the nature of Gondwanan species flocks: Diversity of Proteaceae in Mediterranean south-western Australia and South Africa,,SEED BANK DYNAMICS; SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA; WOODY-PLANTS; WATER RELATIONS; CAPE-PROVINCE; FRUIT CHARACTERISTICS; BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS; FYNBOS PROTEACEAE; FAMILY RUBIACEAE; MATCHED SITES,"The Proteaceae, a Gondwanan family, are richly represented in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region (CFR) (331 species, 14 genera) and Australia's South West Botanical Province (SWBP) (682 species, 16 genera). Both of these regions have mediterranean-type climates, infertile soils, similar geomorphic and climatic histories, and show strong convergences in plant form and function. There are many similarities in the patterns and ecological correlates of diversity in the CFR and SWBP Proteaceae. First, both floras are overwhelmingly endemic, with many large genera and correspondingly high species to genus ratios, indicating massive in situ diversification (species flocks). Second, on both continents, high habitat (mainly edaphic) specialisation leads to similar levels of beta diversity. Third, most species are non-sprouters (i.e. killed by fire) and of intermediate size. There are, however, several divergences in these patterns and correlates. First, in the SWBP, Proteaceae invariably emerge as one of the largest families in florulas, whereas they occupy a much lower rank in the CFR. Second, species numbers in the SWBP peak in landscapes having intermediate levels of annual rainfall, whereas CFR Proteaceae diversity peaks in the wettest areas. Third, local diversity is higher in the SWBP where Proteaceae have exploited a wider array of temporal and spatial habitats than in the CFR. Fourth, despite lower environmental heterogeneity in the SWBP, gamma (geographical) diversity is higher there. Fifth, as a result of higher local and gamma diversity, regional richness in the SWBP is more than double that of the CFR. Finally, sprouting, serotiny, bird-pollination and tall stature are proportionally more important traits in the SWBP than the CFR where most species are low, non-sprouting, myrmecochorous, insect-pollinated shrubs. Subtle differences in the historical and contemporary climates of the two regions have resulted in different processes leading to the origin of these species flocks. In the CFR, milder conditions have favoured non-sprouters (short generation times): species have accumulated largely as a result of lineage turnover. Harsher conditions in the SWBP have favoured sprouters: here species have accumulated as a result of both persistence and turnover.",1998

Miscellaneous cases",nectary; floral disk; hydathodes; Buxaceae; Begonia; Pelargonium; Becium; Siphocampylus; Heterothalamus; Pentaphragma,FLORAL NECTARIES; ULTRASTRUCTURE; CAMPANULALES; PHYLOGENY; ANATOMY,"In the present, final part of a series of contributions on nectaries, further, miscellaneous case histories are presented because of their histological or ecological interest. In the special section, extrafloral and floral nectaries of members of six families are treated. A general survey concludes the paper. Extranuptial glands attracting ant guards are associated with the flowers of Becium and Ocimum (Lamiaceae); they represent novel cases in a family hitherto believed to lack this kind of organs. The glands develop in an unusual way by transformation of abscission scars of floral bracts. The five floral but extranuptial glands on the calyx of Siphocampylus betulifolius (Lobeliaceae), with a similar function, are unusual in sharing the same histological structure and drainage via stomatal sap-holes with the closely adjoining nuptial nectary, a disk. Three case histories refer to zoophilous unisexual flowers with only one of the functional sexual morphs rewarding with nectar. In Pachysandra and Sarcococca (monoecious Buxaceae) the male flowers are nectariferous. The nectarless pistillate flowers are inadvertently pollinated by bees while these exploit the staminate flowers. Two other instances, although heterogeneous in detail, exhibit the reverse situation in that only the pistillate flowers yield nectar: the male capitula of the dioecious composite Hererothalamus alienus are girdled by female-sterile ray florets with copious nectar; bees taking it become dusted with pollen when they move over the dry staminate disk florets. They may subsequently pollinate the female heads, which entirely consist of nectariferous pistillate ray florets. In the hummingbird-pollinated Begonia ferruginea it is also the pistillate flowers that contain a presumably nectareous fluid, while the dry staminate ones fallaciously attract the visitors by mimicking the pistillate flowers. Although basically epigynous, the protandrous revolver flowers of the little-known genus Pentaphragma (Pentaphragmataceae) have maintained the subbasal position of their five separate nectaries on the ovary wall, the nectar being accessible to bees via five receptacular channels. In the concluding chapter, possible evolutionary pathways leading to floral nectaries, particularly floral disks, are discussed. Hydathodes of vegetative provenance rather than extrafloral nectaries are likely precursors of most floral nectaries. Developmental modules comprising a single stomatal sap-hole or groups of them, associated with peristomatal gland cells, may have aggregated in flowers to form disks. Separate nectariferous scales as found in flowers of the Cucurbitaceae, Crassulaceae and the Geraniales also reveal similarities with the respective leaf hydathodes. The organophylesis of the single scale seated in the axial spur of Pelargonium is detailed as an example. A clustered distribution of stomatal sap-holes on disks can be partly interpreted as revealing their origin from meristic hydathodal modules. Examples of the diversity of these patterns are given, which are little explored and may provide useful taxonomic characters.",1998

Seeds from 32 half-sibling families were collected from sites differing in mowing frequency and availability of light, nutrients, and water. Six seedlings from each family were grown in controlled environments and photoperiod manipulations were used to control reproduction. Mass of vegetative and reproductive plants of the same family were compared to assess the trade-off between reproduction and growth. Families collected from habitats with a tall canopy were larger and experienced a greater decrease in growth with reproduction than families from habitats where mowing maintained a short canopy. Reproductive output showed no relationship with size, while reproductive allocation (capsule mass to vegetative mass) decreased with size. This decrease may be a direct consequence of the increase in reproductive cost with size. The increase in cost can be partially explained by increased allocation to reproductive support structures; large individuals produce capsules on more elongate scapes and have a lower capsule to scape ratio. Differences in size and morphology among habitats are presumably the result of selection to avoid damage in mown sites and to avoid shade and ensure pollination in sites with a tall canopy and reduced wind movement.",1998

The objectives of this paper ale to quantify (a) whether Chassalia corallioides, a small tree endemic to La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, is another example of the evolution of dioecy from distyly and (b) whether reproductive traits linked to male and female function vary over the ecological distribution of this species. Quantification of pollen production and fruit set following controlled and natural pollinations demonstrate that this species is dioecious. Male flowers have longer corolla tubes than female flowers. Female flowers have long styles with stigmas placed above the anthers whereas males have short styles with stigmas placed below the anthers. Stigmas and anthers are reciprocally placed in each morph, illustrating that the species is morphologically heterostylous. Both fecundity and flower size are negatively correlated with altitude. In male plants, corollas are shorter and wider and anthers are placed closer to the mouth of the corolla tube with increasing altitude. Male plants flowered more often than female plants, the likely cause of the male biased sex ratio in each of the two years studied. The evolution of dioecy in relation to the island biogeography of the region and the diversification of the genus Chassalia is discussed.",1998

These studies were (1) a measure of the variability of plants within and between populations and between subspecies using 5 A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis populations, 2 A. cana ssp. cana populations, and 1 A. cana ssp. viscidula population; (2) an examination of the hypothesis that tetraploid (4x) Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana derives de novo from diploid (2x) populations via autopolyploidy; and (3) an examination of the validity of the status of putative hybrids that have been produced by controlled pollination. These latter hybrid combinations-A. tridentata ssp. tridentata x A. t. ssp. vaseyana, A. t. spp wyomingensis x A. tripartita, and A. cana ssp. cana x A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis-were made to combine traits of parental taxa in unique combinations with possible management application. RAPD marker data were subjected to similarity and UPGMA clustering analyses. RAPD markers were effective in measuring genetic diversity at different systematic levels. Individuals plants within a population were approximately 55% to >80% similar to one another, populations within subspecies gave corresponding values of similarity, probably a result of the combined effects of large population sizes and wind pollination. The 2 subspecies of A. cana were approximately 45% similar. At least some 4x populations of A. tridentata ssp. vaseyana apparently derive de novo from 2x plants based on their being embedded in 2x phenogram groups, thus reinforcing evidence that autopolyploidy plays an important role in Tridentatae population biology. Two (A. tridentata ssp. tridentata x A. t. ssp. vaseyana and A. cana ssp. cana x A. tridentata ssp wyomingenesis) of the 3 putative hybrid combinations were confined to include hybrids. These hybrids may have potential in management applications. Additional use of RAPD technology combined with other techniques may be useful in delimiting genetic characteristics and in guiding artificial selection in the Tridentatae.",1998
Pollen morphology and functional dioecy in Solanum (Solanaceae),Solanaceae; Solanum; evolution; male sterility; breeding system; dioecy; inaperturate pollen; pollen development; palynology; plant reproduction,SEED PLANTS; ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; HIRTUM SOLANACEAE; FLOWERING PLANTS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; MALE-STERILITY; EVOLUTION; POLLINATION; ANGIOSPERMS,"Dioecy has evolved independently several times in the large, mostly tropical genus Solanum. In all cases of dioecy in Solanum functionally male flowers have normal anthers, normal pollen and reduced stigmas while functionally female flowers have stigmas and anthers that appear normal but contain non-functional, usually inaperturate pollen. The inaperturate pollen has living cytoplasm, but apparently never germinates and it has been hypothesised that the pollen in these functionally female flowers is retained as a pollinator reward. Pollen morphology is compared in twelve of the thirteen known dioecious species of Solanum, and some stages in the the development of inaperturate pollen in the anthers of functionally female flowers of Solanum confertiseriatum of Western Ecuador are examined. Observations on the development and morphology of inaperturate pollen in functionally female flowers of Solanum are related to hypotheses about the evolution of dioecy in the genus.",1998
Floral biology and reproductive ecology of Clusia nemorosa (Clusiaceae) in northeastern Brazil,"Clusiaceae, Clusia; melittophily, dioecy, gynodioecy, polygamodioecy, floral resin, euglossine bees",SMITH WOODSON CARICACEAE; TROPICAL FOREST TREES; DALECHAMPIA EUPHORBIACEAE; EUGLOSSINE BEES; RAIN-FOREST; SOUTH-AFRICA; SEX-RATIOS; POLLINATION; EVOLUTION; POLLEN,"Between March 1993 and May 1995 the floral biology and the phenology of Clusia nemorosa G. MEY. (Clusiaceae) were studied in two dioecious populations in Pernambuco State, and some observations were made in gynodioecious populations, that were encountered only in Bahia State. The species flowers from June to January/February. The flowers are bowl shaped, and last only one day. The floral reward is resin which is produced by staminodia in all types of flowers. The sex ratio was 1:1 for the studied populations. The pollen viability was approximately 98%. Apomixis was not observed. The rate of fruit set, in hermaphrodite individuals, under natural conditions and the sex ratio of the gynodioecious populations studied suggest that the hermaphrodite individuals may behave as males. Clusia nemorosa is melittophilous and was visited by 16 species of bees. The main pollinators were Euplusia mussitans, E. iopyhrra, Eulaema cingulata, E. nigrita, Euglossa cordata and Euglossa sp.",1998
"Remarkable nectaries: Structure, ecology, organophyletic perspectives III. Nectar ducts",nectary; septal nectary; nectar ducts; Alliaceae; Violaceae; Wachendorfia; Silene; Capsicum; Linaria,HAEMODORACEAE,"The present, third part of a series of studies on floral and extrafloral nectaries deals with auxiliary structures whose function is to conduct nectar from its source towards a more or less distant site of exposition. Ducts occur especially in plant groups that have a fixed conformation of floral organs and have been unable to dislocate the nectary towards a site more appropriate for pollination, such as spurs and narrow tubular containers. These drainage systems are concealed, preventing access to visitors. In all known cases, they run externally in capillary clefts between floral organs or in tubes 20-70 mu m in diam., formed by invaginations of the cutinized but easily wettable epidermal surface with +/- tightly connivent margins. The nectar flows along the ducts driven by capillary forces, secretion pressure and, in part, gravity. The Alliaceae, whose papillate septal nectaries principally bear their three primary outlets at the top of the superior ovary, only rarely discharge the fluid directly at these points, a case exemplified by Allium cernuum. In Brodiaea and Nothoscordum, cryptic ducts run along the external carpellary sutures towards the base of the ovary, where the nectar is released. In Triteleia and Dichelostemma, they continue proximally along an ovarial stipe that extends the distance between the source and the site of nectar deposition. An extreme is achieved in Milla, whose stipe is connate with the perigon tube by means of three septa; each of the three resulting separate nectar pipes is fed with nectar by ducts which run along the stipe over a distance of up to 13 cm, with apertures in the pipe's lower end. The zygomorphic flowers of Wachendorfia (Haemodoraceae), with a semi-inferior, trilocular ovary, have only two nectariferous ovarial septa. These are sunken in the torus and drained by lateral, retroverse channels which conduct the fluid to a pair of external, spur-like auricles of the perigon segments. The nectar of Silene schafta and allies (Caryophyllaceae) collects at the bottom of an elongate, tubular calyx. Its source is a disk, borne a considerable distance away - as all remaining floral parts - by a long columnar stipe. The liquid flows within 10 cryptic channels along the stipe and is released at its base above the insertion of the calyx. In Capsicum (Solanaceae), nectar produced by an ovarial disk travels through concealed ducts from the inaccessible tubular part of the corolla towards five apertures which lie outside the staminal fascicle on the flat limb. Analogous drainage systems of the related genera Jaltomata and Physalis are illustrated. The spur of the zygomorphic corollas of Linaria and Kickxia (Scrophulariac.) is supplied with nectar by means of a single duct which descends from the disk and runs down along the dorsal wall to the spur's tip where the fluid is released into the main lumen of the spur. The Violaceae use different strategies to overcome the problem of supplying long spurs with the nectar they produce by distant connectival glands. In Corynostylis volubilis an internal furrow of the spur wall probably assumes this function, leading from the nectar scale to the spur's tip 5 cm away.",1998

We studied the pollination system and reproductive success of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull over 3 years in an Upper Ardennes site in Belgium. A wide variety of insect visitors was recorded including Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera. Relative abundance of families and species of visitors varied markedly among years except for bees. Bumblebees and honeybees were the most efficient pollinators at the study site. Syrphid flies, mainly large ones, acted as important co-pollinators because of their high relative frequency. Calluna pollen was also dispersed by wind, and insect-exclusion experiments demonstrated that wind pollination contributed to reproductive success. Following open pollination, fruit set was high, ranging from 82.0 to 97.2% and independent of sampling location. Mean seed number per fruit was less than maximum potential seed number and varied strongly among sampling locations. We discuss this pollination system (generalist insect and wind) in terms of the ecological and geographical success of the species.",1998

"Is relative pollen production or removal a good predictor of relative male fitness? An experimental exploration with a wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana, Rosaceae)",Fragaria virginiana; male fitness; paternity; pollen; pollen removal; reproduction; Rosaceae; siring success; strawberry,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POPULATION; DISPERSAL; TRAITS; PLANTS,"Understanding plant reproduction requires knowledge of genetic contributions through pollen and seeds. Since direct genetic assessments of fitness through pollen are often intractable, reproductive ecologists use components of male fitness such as pollen production and pollen removal as surrogates for paternity. However. we know little of the strength of the relationship between these components and actual paternity. Here, I report on a study undertaken to examine the relationship of pollen production and removal with paternity in Fragaria virginiana, a wild strawberry. A morphological marker was used to track paternity in experimental arrays exposed to native pollinators. Relative pollen production proved to be a poor predictor of relative paternity in most arrays, and over all arrays there was no significant correlation between relative paternity and relative pollen production. In contrast, relative pollen removed correlated significantly and positively with proportion of seeds sired, suggesting that a plant's contribution to the pool of removed pollen is a good predictor of its male reproductive success. Deviations from expected paternity based on relative pollen removal suggest a systematic overestimation of the airing success of plants with low pollen removal. And, in at least one specific cast, low pollen removal may be explained by delayed anther dehiscence, which could lower the effectiveness of the removed pollen.",1998
Bat pollination of the terrestrial herb Irlbachia alata (Gentianaceae) in northeastern Brazil,Gentianaceae; Phyllostomidae; Glossophaga soricina; pollination biology; chiropterophily; Atlantic forest,SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; HUMMINGBIRDS; ECOLOGY; FLOWER,"The pollination of the terrestrial herb Irlbachia alata by the bat Glossophaga soricina was recorded in northeastern Brazil. This herb colonizes disturbed swampy sites in clearings and forest edges, blooming year-round. Its greenish white flowers open at dusk and attract phyllostomid bats and hawkmoths. The long-tongued bat Glossophaga soricina is the major pollinator of I. alata at the study site, with its trapline visits promoting cross-pollination of this herb. The small flowers and the delicate stem of I. alata match the small size and the manoeuverable flight of glossophagine bats.",1998
"Ecological causes, function, and evolution of abortion and parthenocarpy in Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae)",abortion; parthenocarpy; predispersal seed predation; seed production,SEED PRODUCTION; TEREBINTHUS L; FRUITS; SET; PLANTS; COMPETITION; POLLINATION; LIMITATION; EVERGREEN; PATTERNS,"Parthenocarpy (the production of seedless fruits) and abortion of reproductive structures at different developmental stages are important processes limiting female fecundity in Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae), a Mediterranean endozoochorous dioecious shrub. This paper (i) tests the effects of water and pollen as the ecological causes of abortion and parthenocarpy, (ii) tests the function of abortion and parthenocarpy regarding the uncertainty of resources and predispersal seed predation, and (iii) reviews the evolution of parthenocarpy across the phylogeny of the genus Pistacia and the family Anacardiaceae. Using experimental manipulations, we examined the effects of pollen and water availability on female fecundity. The components of female fecundity were the four sequential developmental stages in the reproductive cycle: (i) flower survival after pollination, (ii) latent ovary survival, (iii) final-sized fruit survival, and (iv) seed viability. The survival of reproductive structures along the four developmental stages in response to pollination was highly variable. The survival of pollen-excluded flowers was negligible. Water addition increased the survival of reproductive structures in the first two developmental stages but this effect was lost in the other two stages. However, irrigation had a delayed effect, significantly increasing the number of viable seeds per number of flowers at the following reproductive season. The irrigated females significantly increased the percentage of viable seeds, whereas nonirrigated females did not. These data support the hypothesis that the adjustment of progeny size to the available resources is an individual feature inherent to the life history of each individual and therefore independent of the present resource level. This adjustment may have an adaptive value in relation to uncertainty of water availability. An advantage for parthenocarpy in terms of reducing seed predation was not found and it may be a nonadaptive plesiomorphic character within the genus Pistacia and within the family Anacardiaceae. A significant negative relationship was found between the rate of seed abortion and predispersal seed predation by wasps, suggesting that abortion reduces insect predation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that fruits with aborted seeds abscised in a lower proportion than expected, while fruits with seeds parasitized by wasps fell in a greater proportion than expected.",1998
Global climate change and tropical forest genetic resources,,CO2 ENRICHMENT; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELEVATED CO2; DRY FOREST; TREES; PHENOLOGY; SYSTEMS; PLANT; INCOMPATIBILITY; RESPONSES,"Global climate change may have a serious impact on genetic resources in tropical forest trees. Genetic diversity plays a critical role in the survival of populations in rapidly changing environments. Furthermore, most tropical plant species are known to have unique ecological niches, and therefore changes in climate may directly affect the distribution of biomes, ecosystems, and constituent species. Climate change may also indirectly affect plant genetic resources through effects on phenology, breeding systems, and plant-pollinator and plant seed disperser interactions, and may reduce genetic diversity and reproductive output. As a consequence, population densities may be reduced leading to reduction in genetic diversity through genetic drift and inbreeding. Tropical forest plants may respond to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, adaptive evolution, migration to suitable site, or extinction. However, the potential to respond is limited by a rapid pace of change and the non-availability of alternate habitats due to past and present trends of deforestation. Thus climate change may result in extinction of many populations and species. Our ability to estimate the precise response of tropical forest ecosystems to climate change is limited by lack of long-term data on parameters that might be affected by climate change. Collection of correlative data from long-term monitoring of climate as well as population and community responses at selected sites offer the most cost-effective way to understand the effects of climate change on tropical tree populations. However, mitigation strategies need to be implemented immediately. Because many effects of climate change may be similar to the effects of habitat alteration and fragmentation, protected areas and buffer zones should be enlarged, with an emphasis on connectivity among conserved landscapes. Taxa that are likely to become extinct should be identified and protected through at situ conservation programs.",1998
The pollination ecology of five species of Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae) in the tallgrass prairie,,EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS,"The floral ecology of Penstemon cobaea Nutt. var. cobaea, P. cabaea var. purpureus Pennell. P. digitalis Nutt. ex Sims, P. grandiflorus Nutt., P. pallidus Small, and P. tubaeflorus Nutt. was studied by sampling populations at nine prairie sites in Illinois. Kansas, and Missouri. rill five species show protandry, but the receptive stigma lies only 2 mm away from the two pairs of fertile stamens. Bagging experiments on three Penstemon spp. show that only P. digitalis sets seed when insect visitors are excluded. Flowers of all five species exhibit a horizontal presentation of the corolla and emit a slightly discernible scent. However, the presumed pollination systems of Penstemon spp, correlate with corolla form and the size of the floral sinus. The tubular, white flowers of P. tubaeflorus appear to be pollinated by a combination of diurnal Lepidoptera and some native bees favoring a dorsal deposition of pollen on mouthparts and upper thoraces. The four remaining species have gullet- or bell-shaped corollas ornamented with violet-purple blotches or lines. These species appear to be pollinated primarily by polylectic/polyphagic bees (including sis Rombus spp.). with P. digitalis and P. cobaea visited infrequently by the rare Penstemon wasp, Pseudomasaris occidentalis. Queens of Bombus pennsylvanicus subsp. pennsylvanicus forage primarily on the large, gullet flowers of P. grandiflorus and both varieties of P. cobaea. Queens of Bombus nevadensis subsp. auricomus prefer those P. digitalis and P. pallidus shoring a reduced gullet or bell form. Ree pollination in four Penstemon spp. may operate within a two-tiered system. Large-bodied Bombus spp., Megachile brevis, and anthophorids (Synhalonia hamata and Anthophora terminalis) carry dorsal depositions of Penstemon pollen because they contact anthers and stigmas while they forage exclusively for nectar. In contrast, small-bodied members of the Anthophoridae (Ceratina), Colletidae (Hylaeus spp.), Halictidae (Augochlorella, Halictus, Lasioglossum), and Megachilidae (Hoplitis and Osmia) forage actively for Penstemon pollen encouraging repeated, ventral contact with the sexual organs of the flowers. Bombus queens were more prevalent at large Penstemon populations (especially P. cobaea). Bombus workers were collected primarily on restored sites. The importance of small bees as pollinators appeared to vary indirectly with Penstemon population size.",1998
An evaluation of the AFLP fingerprinting technique for the analysis of paternity in natural populations of Persoonia mollis (Proteaceae),,MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; ARBITRARY PRIMERS; POLLEN DISPERSAL; GENETIC-MARKERS; DNA; PCR; DIVERSITY; RAPD; AMPLIFICATION,"The accurate assignment of paternity in natural plant populations is required to address important issues in evolutionary biology, such as the factors that affect reproductive success. Newly developed molecular fingerprinting techniques offer the potential to address these aims. Here, we evaluate the utility of a new PCR-based multi-locus fingerprinting technique called Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) for paternity studies in Persoonia mollis (Proteaceae). AFLPs were initially scored for five individuals from three taxonomic levels for 64 primer pairs: between species (P. mollis and P, levis), between subspecies (P. mollis subsp. nectens and subsp. livens), between individuals within a single population of P. mollis, as well as for a naturally pollinated seed from a single P. mollis subsp. nectens plant. Overall, 1164 fragments (24.6% of all fragments) were polymorphic between species, 743 (16.5%) between subspecies, 371 (8.6%) between individuals within a single population, and 265 (6.2%) between a plant and its seed. Within a single P. mollis population of 14 plants, 42 polymorphic fragments were scored from profiles generated by a single AFLP primer pair. The mean frequency of the recessive allele (q) over these 42 loci was 0.773. Based on these observations, it will be feasible to generate well over 100 polymorphic AFLP loci with as few as three AFLP primer pairs. This level of polymorphism is sufficient to assign paternity unambiguously to more than 99% of all seed in experiments involving Small, known paternity pools. More generally, the AFLP procedure is well suited to molecular ecological studies, because it produces more polymorphism than allozymes or RAPDs but, unlike conventionally developed microsatellite loci, it requires no prior sequence knowledge and minimal development time.",1998
Geographic and taxonomic distribution of a positive interaction: ant-tended homopterans indirectly benefit figs across southern Africa,ant-plant-homopteran interactions; Ficus; geographic distribution of interactions; indirect effects; positive interactions,MEMBRACID MUTUALISM; PLANTS; POLLINATORS; CONSEQUENCE; COMMUNITIES; PROTECTION; NECTARIES; ECOLOGY,"Although species pairs and assemblages often occur across geographic regions, ecologists know very little about the outcome of their interactions on such large spatial scales. Here, we assess the geographic distribution and taxonomic diversity of a positive interaction involving ant-tended homopterans and fig trees in the genus Ficus. Previous experimental studies ar a few locations in South Africa indicated that Ficus sur indirectly benefited from the presence of a homopteran (Hilda patruelis) because it attracted ants (primarily Pheidole megacephala) that reduced the effects of both pre-dispersal ovule gallers and parasitoids of pollinating wasps. Based on this work, we evaluated three conditions that must be met in order to support the hypothesis that this indirect interaction involves many fig species and occurs throughout much of southern Africa and Madagascar. Data on 429 trees distributed among five countries indicated that 20 of 38 Ficus species, and 46% of all trees sampled, had ants on their figs. Members of the Sycomorus subgenus were significantly more likely to attract ants than those in the Urostigma subgenus, and ant-colonization levels on these species were significantly greater than for Urostigma species. On average, each ant-occupied F, sur tree had 37% of its fig crop colonized by ants, whereas the value was 24% for other Ficus species. H. patruelis was the most common source for attracting ants, although figs were also attacked by a range of other ant-tended homopterans. P. megacephala was significantly more common on figs than other ant species, bei:ng present on 58% of sampled trees. Ant densities commonly exceeded 4.5 per fig, which a field experiment indicated was sufficient to provide protection from ovule gallers and parasitoids of pollinators. Forty-nine percent of all colonized F. sui trees sampled had ant densities equal to or greater than 4.5 per fig, whereas this value was 23% for other Ficus species. We conclude that there is considerable evidence to suggest that this indirect interaction occurs across four southern African countries and Madagascar, and involves many Ficus species.",1998

Infrageneric relationships and species-level patterns of evolution were investigated in phylogenetic analyses using morphological, molecular, and combined data sets. All data sets resolved three main species groups which correspond to the three sections recognized by McDOWELL (1996). However, the analyses of ITS sequence data placed the two South American species basal to the three main clades. Otherwise, the morphological and molecular data are highly compatible, and produce a more robust yet consistent phylogeny in the combined data analysis. Morphological evolution in Exostema involves many specializations for xeric habitats, reflecting repeated ecological shifts from moist forest to exposed, seasonally dry environments during the diversification of the genus. Both moth and bee pollination syndromes are found in Exostema, and shifts in pollination ecology appear pivotal to the differentiation of the three sections. Biogeographically, Exostema likely originated in South America and migrated via Central America to the Greater Antilles, where the morphological diversification and speciation are most extensive.",1998
"Pollination ecology of Gentianella uliginosa, a rare annual of the Dutch coastal dunes",,POPULATION-SIZE; SELF-FERTILIZATION; PNEUMONANTHE L; SEED-SET; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; SCABIOSA-COLUMBARIA; GENETIC-VARIATION; SALVIA-PRATENSIS; LIFE-HISTORY; PLANTS,"The pollination ecology of Gentianella uliginosa, a rare annual in The Netherlands, was studied in three relatively small coastal dune populations. In all populations, the species was fully self-compatible: manual self pollination resulted in a seed set of 92-94%. Autofertility was also high (seed set of caged, unhandled flowers 80-85%). The homogamous flowers were visited by Bombus pascuorum, which collected nectar and transported pollen sternotribically. Differences among populations in bumblebee visitation rate did not affect natural seed set. In one plot, seed set following natural pollination was lower than after manual selfing, and as high as after spontaneous selfing. As flowers here were also visited frequently, this might be due to pollen limitation through heterospecific pollen competition. Support for this hypothesis was derived from another population, where seed set after natural pollination was lower in a plot dominated by co-flowering Mentha aquatica than in a plot with few Mentha. However, differences in water availability might also have caused this. In one population, seed sets of the cross pollination and spontaneous selfing treatments were lower than those of the manual selfing and natural pollination treatments. Whether the low outcrossing success can be attributed to small differences in the treatment of the experimental plants or to outcrossing depression remains unclear. We conclude that this annual species is most likely a predominant selfer. Its high autofertility is probably an adaptation to its wet dune slack habitat, where reproductive assurance may be important to cope with unpredictable fluctuations in water table, summer droughts and pollinator service.",1998

Blanche and Molero (Ranunculaceae), is a very rare endemic plant known from only two populations in Catalonia, having fewer than 1500 individuals. A biological survey of this species included: (a) reproductive biology, comprising pollination ecology, breeding systems, seed set and pollen viability; and (b) enzyme electrophoresis to measure genetic variation within and between two populations. A trend to increasing self-pollination rates (up to 20%) and to low levels of genetic variation (1.6-1.7 alleles per locus), together with high rates of nectar robber visits are reported. The hypothetic evolutionary relationships (chromosomal changes and geographic isolation) of this species with its related widespread ancestor Delphinium fissum are also discussed. The main threats to this species are catastrophic events (especially as soil erosion), human impact activities (both agriculture and tourism) and decreasing pollination. The small populations and low genetic variation reinforce its endangered status. Some conservation measures are suggested, including in-situ and ex-situ strategies.  ",1998
Plasticity of flower longevity in Corydalis ambigua,Corydalis ambigua; flower longevity; plasticity; pollination; temperature,INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS; FLORAL LONGEVITY; ORCHIDACEAE; ALLOCATION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; NECTAR; FOREST,"We investigated the longevity of individual flowers of Corydalis ambigua Cham. et Schlecht. during different periods of pollinator activity and at different temperatures. To measure potential (unpollinated) flower longevity of C. ambigua, this study was conducted at forest islands where pollinator visits were scarce. The longevity of individual flowers of C. ambigua indicated high plasticity. The longevity of unpollinated flowers in natural pollination ranged from 2 to 25 days and continuously decreased with the date of flower opening. The temperature increased as the flowering season progressed. Furthermore, the greenhouse transplanting experiment showed that higher temperatures shorten the life span of flowers. The longevity of pollinated flowers subjected to hand pollination of newly opened flowers was shorter than that of unpollinated flowers in natural pollination regardless of the date of flower opening. These results showed that not only high temperature but also pollination shortens flower longevity. We discuss the role of plasticity in flower longevity for C. ambigua in relation to pollination success and reduction in the maintenance cost of the flowers.",1998
Reproductive biology of island and mainland populations of Primula mistassinica (Primulaceae) on Lake Huron shorelines,distyly; insularity; pollination; reproductive biology,POLLINATION; EVOLUTION; DISPERSAL; GENETICS; ECOLOGY; SIZE,"To investigate the influence of insularity on plant reproductive biology at a local geographic scale, we examined aspects of reproduction in distylous Primula mistassinica Michx. (Primulaceae) on Lake Huron shorelines of the Bruce Peninsula and adjacent Tobermory Islands in Ontario, Canada. A total of 7 mainland and 13 nearshore island populations were compared. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that P. mistassinica possesses a dimorphic incompatibility system with intermorph crosses setting significantly more seeds than self or intramorph crosses. Floral morphology, population style-morph ratios, and seed fertility were compared in mainland and nearshore island populations to determine whether there was evidence for differences in reproductive traits between these areas. Style-morph ratios did not differ significantly from equilibrium expectations, and there were no consistent differences between island and mainland populations in floral morphology or fertility. Rather, the generalized pollination system of P. mistassinica and extensive historical opportunities for colonization appear to have mitigated insular effects so that proximate ecological factors are more relevant to the current reproductive biology of populations.",1998
Coevolution in an Amazonian hummingbird-plant community,,CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; FLOWERING PHENOLOGIES; HERMIT HUMMINGBIRDS; ORGANIZATION; POLLINATION; COMPETITION; NECTAR; REGULARITY; FOREST; BIRDS,"Relationships between hummingbirds and their food plants are often considered to have arisen through coevolution, However, while it is certainly the case that hummingbirds and plants are coevolved, it is not always clear to what extent coevolution has shaped community structure and the morphology of the birds and plants. Here I examine the hummingbird-plant community of a lowland Amazonian rainforest in southeastern Colombia and test hypotheses concerning coevolution and community structure. To determine the strength of interrelationships and the degree to which character displacement has occurred, the distributions of three floral traits (flowering phenology, nectar production and corolla length) and two hummingbird traits (culmen length and foraging ecology) have been statistically tested against random null models. Although the hummingbird-plant community at Matamata is diverse and is highly likely to have a long shared evolutionary history, there is little evidence for pairwise coevolution. Instead, the community appears to have evolved through diffuse coevolution, resulting in guilds of hummingbirds and plants.",1998

Many crops are known to hybridize with wild relatives, but few studies have looked at the long-term persistence of crop genes in the wild. This study investigated one factor in the hybridization process in radish: differential pollinator visitation to wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) vs. crop-wild F-1 hybrids (R. sativus X R. raphanistrum). Wild genotypes had yellow flowers, a recessive single-locus trail, whereas hybrids always had white or pale pink flowers. In experimental arrays in northern Michigan, total pollinator visitation was significantly biased toward wild plants when the frequencies of wild and hybrid plants were equal. Syrphid flies, the most frequent visitors, preferred wild plants while bumble bees showed no preference. This pattern was also observed when hybrid plants were overrepresented in the array (12 hybrid:2 wild). In contrast, when hybrid plants were rare (2 hybrid:12 wild), neither morph was preferred by any pollinator group. Later in the summer, pollinators were also observed in a large experimental garden with nearly equal frequencies of wild and hybrid plants. Cabbage butterflies (Pieris rapae) strongly overvisited wild plants, while bumble bees showed a slight preference for hybrids. Taken together, these studies suggest that F-1 hybrids may not be at a disadvantage with regard to pollinator visits when they occur at low frequencies or when bumble bees are frequent flower visitors. Thus, variation in the proportion of white-flowered morphs among wild radish populations could be influenced by different histories of crop-to-wild hybridization, as well as by variation in the composition of local pollinator taxa.",1998

Detailed floral examination confirmed that the species are functionally dioecious, i.e., a given individual lacks either ovules or pollen grains. Female inflorescences bagged to prevent pollination never produced seed, but intraspecific crosses between male and female individuals nearly always yielded fruits with viable seed (>80%). Interspecific crosses between species from different islands and separate taxonomic sections of the genus also yielded good fruit set (>55%). Interspecific F-1 hybrids were vigorous and appeared to be morphologically intermediate to their parents. Intergeneric crosses between Geniostoma and Labordia failed. Chromosome counts from Labordia species were found to be 2n = 80 or 2n approximate to 80, twice the chromosome complement of two collections examined from its postulated ancestor, Geniostoma rupestre. Labordia species are distinct morphologically, ecologically, and geographically but apparently lack genetic barriers to interbreeding. This suggests that geographical and ecological isolation, recentness of colonization, and/or rapid speciation have been important factors in the origin of species of Labordia.",1998
"Management and restoration ecology of the federal threatened Mead's milkweed, Asclepias meadii (Asclepiadaceae)",,EXALTATA; CONSEQUENCES; POLLINATION; COMPETITION; THISTLE; SYSTEMS; SYRIACA; RARITY; FRUIT,"The federal threatened Asclepias meadii Torr. (Asclepiadaceae) is a perennial, self-incompatible prairie forb imperiled by habitat destruction and population fragmentation. Many large populations persist in prairie haymeadows in Kansas and Missouri despite removal of seed pods by annual summer mowing. Only a few small populations remain in Illinois. Iowa, and northern Missouri. Recovery of these small populations and restoration of new populations are recovery objectives for this species.This study was conducted to determine habitat differences among populations, to understand how hay mowing and lire management affect the structure of A. meadii populations, and to test the effects of different management treatments on restoration of this species. Soils analysis showed a geographic gradient, with southern populations on acid, nutrient-poor soils, and northern populations on calcareous, nutrient-rich soils. Milkweed ramet densities were lower in fire-managed prairies than in haymeadows; but burned sites had 68% flowering ramets while haymeadows had only 19% flowering ramets. This suggests that burning has selected for greater resource allocation toward sexual reproduction, while annual hay mowing has selected for greater resource allocation toward clonal spread. The Morion Arboretum is conducting: experimental restoration of Asciepias meadiii in the eastern part of its range, an objective of Federal Recovery Planning. In greenhouse and garden experiments. competition from oats significantly reduced seedling growth, with greater growth in artificially outcrossed seedlings. At seven restoration sites in Illinois and northern Indiana. significant variation in milkweed germination. survivorship and growth was caused by weather, differences among sites, and site management. Seedling were vulnerable to drought, with greater survivorship when rainfall was 200% of normal. Planted juvenile mill;weeds had greater survivorship than seedlings, and less sensitivity to drought. Greater growth anti survivorship also occurred in burned than in unburned plots at three sites, but not in all life-stages. Propagated plants from Missouri seed sources were larger than Kansas plants in the garden, but not in the field. Continued work is needed to determine if restored populations can become viable, and if there are negative effects of crossing and translocating genotypes.",1998

We describe here an integrated approach for such decisionmaking. This approach considers site potential, desired landscape, seeding objectives, conflicting land use philosophies, appropriate plant materials, weed invasion, community seral status, and economic limitations. Technical limitations are considered in generating a plan that has the greatest potential for success. Determining whether native-site plant material is best depends on objectives, heterogeneity of the site's environment, uniqueness of the site, plant population size, and biotic or abiotic site disturbance. Fixation of alien genes Into a population is referred to both as introgression, which may ensure maintenance of genetic variation critical for adaptation to a changing environment, and as genetic pollution, with the potential for swamping native cross-pollinating annual or short-lived perennial gene pools. Precautionary procedures during seed increase minimize genetic shift, which may be reversible, but genetic drift could result in permanent loss of desirable genes. A variety of germplasm classes, ranging from site-specific to widely adapted and varying in degrees of heterozygosity and heterogeneity should be considered. Material originating from multiple sites may increase the opportunity for natural selection. An understanding of the magnitude and nature of a species' genetic variation, its relationship to ecological adaptation, and its interaction with other ecosystem components contribute to informed decision-making. Though often unavailable, experience is the best guide for predicting performance of materials on non-native sites.",1998

A combination of long-distance dispersal and colonization after deglaciation, and pollen limitation resulting from reduced pollinator diversity and abundance documented on islands, predicts the breakdown of heterostyly to favour the establishment of self-compatible homostyles on islands. To test if self-fertilizing homostyles have been selected, variation in floral characters and compatibility relationships were examined in M. trifoliata populations from the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland. Morph ratio and its effect on fruit and seed set were examined in nine populations. Of the seven dimorphic populations, morphs occurred in a 1:1 ratio in four populations and deviated significantly from a 1:1 ratio in three populations. The two populations monomorphic for either pin or thrum morphs set few fruits or seeds (<15%). A strictly reciprocal arrangement of stigma height and anther length was not observed between pin and thrum morphs in the majority of populations studied. Stigma-anther separation showed a bimodal distribution with few intermediate ""homostylous"" flowers, rather than the discreet bimodal distribution typical of distylous species. Fruit and seed set were high (>60%) in equal morph ratio populations and were not significantly correlated to stigma-anther separation, indicating that there was no selective advantage of being homostylous. All three populations tested were highly self-incompatible, confirming that there has not been a breakdown of heterostyly on the island of Newfoundland. A reduced pollinator fauna typical of island environments may have relaxed stabilizing selection for strict herkogamy between floral morphs, resulting in the observed lack of reciprocity.",1998

Insects exhibit spectacular and diverse behaviors and ecological interactions that should be preserved in their own right, and more importantly, they provide essential processes for the long-term survival of populations and species assemblages in preserved landscapes. As habitats are increasingly Fragmented and disturbed, vital insect-driven interactions may be disrupted greatly diminishing the survival of the community. Research is needed to evaluate the effect of habitat change on insect interactions, in addition to the presence or absence of insects. The presence of a species does not indicate anything about its behavior; insect behavior is the key to participation in interactions, the lock binding communities together. Mutualisms such as pollination,systems; and parasitisms such as bird-ectoparasite or parasitoid-herbivore systems, have been shown to be affected by fragmentation of habitats. Conservation management directed at ensuring the survival of functional flagship species interactions will preserve other codependent and coexisting species and interactions. Entomologists are the most competent at recognizing, understanding, and manipulating insect interactions and should apply this knowledge and these skills to the needs of conservation. Lessons from applied entomology, including integrated pest management, clearly show the importance of preserving interactions.",1998
Floral trait variation in four Cyclamen (Primulaceae) species,Primulaceae; Cyclamen; buzz-pollination; floral biology; inbreeding coefficients; Mediterranean islands; pollen/ovule ratio,POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; FLOWERING PLANTS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; BUZZ-POLLINATION; SEX ALLOCATION; POLLEN; ISLAND; RESOURCES; BIOLOGY,"The purpose of this study is to examine floral trait variation between four Cyclamen species that show variation in their ability to reproduce in the absence of pollinators and in levels of inbreeding. Pollen and ovule production, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen volume, petal length and width, diameter of the corolla mouth, pistil and stamen length, and stigma-anther separation varied significantly between the four study species. Flower, pollen and ovule production, pollen volume and corolla size were generally highest in C. hederifolium, the species with the lowest level of inbreeding (mean F-is = 0.329), intermediate in both species with relatively high levels of pollinator-mediated inbreeding, C. repandum (mean F-is=0.658) and C. creticum (mean F-is=0.748), and lowest in the highly inbred C. balearicum (mean F-is = 0.930). The two species with the most different inbreeding coefficients, C. hederifolium and C. balearicum, had lower pollen-ovule ratios and shorter longevities of stigma receptivity and pollen viability than C. creticum and C. repandum. These patterns of variation in floral traits are discussed in relation to the relatedness, pollination ecology and levels of inbreeding of the four species.",1998
Is Echeveria gibbiflora (Crassulaceae) fecundity limited by pollen availability? An experimental study,female fecundity; hummingbird pollination; Mexico; pollen limitation; resource limitation,SEED PRODUCTION; REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS; POLLINATOR LIMITATION; FRUIT PRODUCTION; YUCCA-WHIPPLEI; FLOWER; ABORTION; RESOURCE; FITNESS; ORCHID,"1. An experimental approach, manually pollinating all the flowers of individual plants, was used to measure the effect of pollen limitation on female fecundity of the hummingbird-pollinated perennial shrub Echeveria gibbiflora in the ecological preserve of Pedregal de San Angel around Mexico City, Mexico. Eleven randomly selected plants were manually over-pollinated in all their flowers and another 11 were left to be freely visited by natural pollinators. 2. Manually pollinated plants produced significantly more fruit and seeds than control plants (1.38 and 1.74 times, respectively). There was no change in average mass of fruits. 3, Considering individual fruit production per plant sampled three times in one season, decreases in fruit mass and average seeds per fruit were observed within the same reproductive season for both treatments. For the manually pollinated plants, from the start to the end of the reproductive season, seed set decreased 55.9%; while in control plants seed set decreased 33.4% in the same period. For both treatments, average fruit mass decreased 26%. 4, Vegetative growth was not significantly different between control and experimental plants but hand-pollinated plants showed a smaller reproduction probability for the following year. 5, It is concluded that female fecundity in E. gibbiflora is limited by pollen early in the reproductive season and by resources in the middle and the end of the season.",1998
The hummingbird community of a lowland Amazonian rainforest,,SPECIES RICHNESS; ORGANIZATION; BIRDS; ECOLOGY; POLLINATION; MORPHOLOGY; HABITATS,"Between October 1987 and September 1989, the British Ornithologists' Union Colombia Expedition recorded 16 species of hummingbird at Matamata in the Amacayacu National Park, Amazonas, Colombia, Most of these species were resident breeders at the study site although two appeared to be local migrants. Six species of hermit hummingbirds (subfamily Phaethornithinae) occurred at Matamata; although very similar in general morphology and behaviour, they showed different preferences for habitat, food plants and foraging technique, Hermits were predominant in the forest, but in areas of secondary vegetation and along riverine borders,""typical"" hummingbirds (subfamily Trochilinae) wore more common. The study site consisted of terra firme and varzea forest and an area of riverine secondary vegetation and contained around 60 species of flowering plants visited by hummingbirds. In contrast with most groups of organisms, hummingbirds and hummingbird-pollinated plants had similar species diversity in primary forest and secondary habitats, The overall abundance of hummingbirds and flowers was significantly higher in areas of riverine secondary growth. The hummingbird community at Matamata is remarkably species rich when compared with study sites elsewhere in North and South America, However, random null model comparisons among Amazonian hummingbird communities reveal that they share many characteristics in their structure and show a high degree of species overlap.",1998

Following binary classification of the above characteristics (herbaceous versus woody Life form, animal-assisted versus abiotic seed dispersal, animal-assisted versus abiotic pollination, dioecous versus hermaphrodite reproductive mode), statistically significant associations were found for all pairs of characteristics except pollination mode and reproductive mode (in disagreement with the results of previous studies which have detected significant associations between dioecy and abiotic pollination) and pollination mode and Life form. To investigate the evolutionary plasticity of the different characters, we used nested analysis of variance with (in the case of life form, for example) percentage of species in genus with herbaceous life form as response variable, and with genus, family, order and subclass as nested factors and class as crossed factor. The results of this analysis indicated that higher-level grouping (class or subclass) accounted for the majority of total variance only in the case of pollination mode, suggesting either that pollination mode was typically determined early in evolutionary history and that there is currently Little plasticity in this characteristic (i.e., phylogenetic constraints), or that this characteristic has been subject to stabilizing selection (i.e., phylogenetic niche conservatism). The other ecological characters, by contrast, showed high variability at lower levels in the taxonomic hierarchy.",1998
Controlled crosses between pendunculate and sessile oak: results and conclusion,Quercus petraea; Quercus robur; controlled crosses; hybrids; species concept,QUERCUS-ROBUR L; PETRAEA MATT LIEBL; PEDUNCULATE OAK,"Among 1989 and 1996 were 40485 flowers of Quercus robur and Quercus petraea controlled crossed. From these crossings developed 5261 acorns and 1933 plants (Fig. 3), 568 are hybrids (Tab. 3). Most hybrids are from the combination Quercus robur x Quercus petraea. Individual crossings barriers are higher in Quercus petraea than in Quercus robur. This is true for inter- and intraspecific crosses (Fig. 5 and 6). The success rate of the crossings is in percent plants from pollinated flowers: Quercus robur (Selfing) 1.3 %; Q. robur x Q. robur (Intraspecific) 11.3 %; Q. robur x Q. petraea (Hybrid) 5.3 %; Q. petraea x Q. robur (Hybrid) 0.8 %; Q. petraea x Q. petraea (Intraspecific) 5.8 %; Quercus petraea (Selfing) 0 %. The rate of success of the combination Quercus robur x Q. petraea is as high as the success rate of the intraspecific crosses with Quercus petraea (Fig. 4, Tab. 2). The weight of the acorns has in so far influence on the crossing success, as acorns from Q. robur, which are heavier, produce a higher rate of plants. From heavier acorns also grow higher plants (Fig. 2, 7). In the morphologic traits the offspring resemble their mothers. Still juvenile traits overlap this. It is discussed, the follow the proposal of KLEINSCHMIT, J. R. G. not to separate these Quercus into two species, but to agree on one species with two ecological separated subspecies.",1998
Toward an ecological approach for the assessment of ecosystem health,,POLLUTION-INDUCED DISTURBANCE; MARINE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES,"Many ecologists express difficulty with the concept of ecosystem health. Ecosystem health must have definable and objective norms that allow for rigorous hypothesis testing for it to be acceptable to those ecologists. One step toward objective measurement of ecosystem health is to characterize ecosystem health by diversity-abundance relationships. The log-normal relationship between diversity and abundance characterizes taxocenes (i.e., taxonomically related groups that have similar ecological functions). Under conditions of stress, the patterns of diversity and abundance often change and are no longer log-normal. This change in patterns has been shown for some, but not all, marine and terrestrial taxocenes tested. The interdisciplinary possibilities for using log-normality, and deviation from it, as a measure of natural and anthropogenic ecosystem health are discussed. The interdisciplinarity of ecosystem health is illustrated with an example of blueberry pollinator decline caused by insecticide spraying in New Brunswick, Canada, and related economic and human health costs.",1998
Plant reproductive intervals and pollinators in the aseasonal tropics: a new model,display effect; reproductive interval; pollination; mortality; productivity; forest strata,RAIN-FOREST; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; BEES,"What factors determine reproductive intervals and modes of pollination in plants of the aseasonal tropics? To answer this general question, we present a new explanation for some community patterns of plant reproductive intervals and pollinators observed in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, using a mathematical model featuring different display effects for different types of pollinators. Predictions from the model matched with the following observed patterns: (i) flowering intervals were different among forest strata (forest floor < understorey < canopy < subcanopy and emergent), and not in the exact order of stratum height; (ii) among generalist pollinators, the proportion of social foragers was maximum in intermediate forest stratum; and (iii) plants pollinated by specialist pollinators were found on the forest floor and in gaps.",1998

The environmental condition of the maternal plant may influence the production of selfed seed relative to outcrossed seed. This study investigated the effect of late pollination on the mating system of Kalmia latifolia, a long-lived perennial shrub. A 2 x 2 experimental design was used to determine whether reproductive success declines over the course of the flowering season and whether there was an interaction between pollination time (early vs. late in the season) and pollen type (self-fertilized vs. outcrossed). An interaction of this sort would indicate context-dependent fitness of selfed seeds compared to outcrossed seeds and, thus, show an ecological influence over a plant's mating system. Relative fitness was assessed in terms of female reproductive success. Timing of pollination did not affect abortion of outcrossed seeds; however, delay in pollination increased abortion of selfed seeds by 34.7%. Thus, it appears that plants selectively aborted selfed seeds rather than outcrossed seeds and this selection was more intense at the end of the season. An ecological factor such as time of pollination may affect the mating system of K. latifolia.",1998

Male sterility, expressed as an absence or nearly complete absence of pollen production, occurs in low frequency in populations of C. fasciculata. Here we describe experiments, using C. fasciculata, to examine frequently cited determinants of the spread and maintenance of male sterility: compensation and the genetic basis of male sterility. In addition, we examine the role the pollination system plays in determining the reproductive success of the male steriles. Seventeen populations in Maryland, Illinois, and Kansas were surveyed and found to range from 0 to 6% male sterility per population. An artificial population of male-sterile simulants and hermaphrodites was created to examine how the local frequency of nonrewarding male steriles might affect male-sterile female reproductive success. Male steriles performed equally poorly, with respect to seed production, whether surrounded by other male-sterile simulants or hermaphrodites. Compensation was examined by comparison of male steriles and hermaphrodites with respect to several reproductive and nonreproductive characters. Male steriles outperformed hermaphrodites in terms of nonreproductive biomass, but performed equally in terms of ovule number and produced many fewer flowers. The genetic basis of male sterility was examined by performing both intra- and interpopulational crosses of male steriles to hermaphrodites and indicate that male sterility is not purely cytoplasmic. The low frequency of male sterility in C. fasciculata populations may reflect reduced female reproductive success because of pollinator avoidance, lack of reproductive compensation, and a mode of inheritance that is not purely cytoplasmic.",1998
Pollination ecology and maintenance of species integrity in co-occurring Disa racemosa L.f. and Disa venosa Sw. (Orchidaceae) in South Africa,,BIOLOGY; DECEPTION; BULBOSA,"The orchid Disa racemosa was found to be pollinated by xylocopine and anthophorine bees (Xylocopa and Amegilla spp.) at several sites in the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. A precise floral mechanism ensures that pollinaria are always attached to the middle pair of legs on the pollinator. Flowers of D. racemosa are nonrewarding, but nevertheless attract bees searching for new food sources. Levels of pollination and fruiting success were low, varying from 4 to 48% among the eight study populations. Disa racemosa is often sympatric and co-flowering with its very similar, though much rarer, sister species Disa venosa. The only character that is consistently different between the taxa is the width of the sepals. Although the two species appear to have the same pollinators, natural hybrids between them have never been found. The results of experimental crosses indicated that a sterility barrier, rather than ethological or mechanical barriers, is responsible for the maintenance of species integrity in mixed populations.",1998
Reaction norms of juvenile traits to light intensity in Iris pumila (Iridaceae): a comparison of populations from exposed and shaded habitats,Iridaceae; Iris pumila; reaction norms; phenotypic plasticity; genetic variation; population differentiation; light intensity,SPATIALLY HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; AVAILABILITY; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION,"Reaction norms were determined in two natural populations of the perennial plant Iris pumila from contrasting light conditions at two levels of photosynthetically active radiation (105 and 35 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)). Seedlings developed from free-pollinated seed families sampled individually from 19 and 12 randomly selected clonal genotypes in an exposed and a shaded population respectively, were grown in a growth room using a mixed model nested factorial experimental design and scored for a number of phenological and morphological traits. Ambient light conditions significantly affected all of the juvenile traits measured. In both populations, relatively convergent norms of reactions were revealed for leaf appearance dates, as well as for leaf number, suggesting the importance of these traits for functional adjustment to prevailing light conditions. Reaction norms for morphological traits, however, were largely nonparallel, but although often crossing each other, a significant family-by-treatment interaction in the ANCOVAs performed was not detected for any of the traits measured, indicating a small amount of genetic variation for plasticity in these populations. The extent of plastic response to light availability was determined and expressed as an index that estimates the percentage change in a trait value from a high to a low light level. Evolutionary and ecological implications of the observed plastic variations are also discussed.",1998
Comparative kairomonal chemical ecology of diabroticite beetles (Coleoptera : Chrysomelidae : Galerucinae : Luperini : Diabroticina) in a reconstituted tallgrass prairie ecosystem,Diabrotica; rootworms; kairomonal attractants; tallgrass prairie,CORN ROOTWORMS COLEOPTERA; CUCURBITA-MAXIMA DUCHESNE; VIRGIFERA-VIRGIFERA; CRISTATA COLEOPTERA; ATTRACTANTS; VOLATILES; NORTHERN; IDENTIFICATION; PHEROMONE; BLOSSOMS,"The olfactory response to volatile semiochemicals was determined for Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber, the spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence, the northern corn rootworm, and Diabrotica cristata (Harris), a nonpest species in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem and adjacent corn and cucurbit agroecosystems in Illinois. The results indicate that the divergence in response to plant volatiles by these Diabrotica species can be correlated with currently accepted phylogenetic groupings between the virgifera and fucata groups, as well as within the virgifera group. For example, cinnamaldehyde is most attractive to D. u. howardi (fucata group), whereas 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde is a specific attractant for D. u. virgifera (virgifera group). The 2 closely related species D. barberi and D. cristata (virgifera group) were both attracted to eugenol, cinnamyl alcohol, and 4-methoxyphenethanol on one or more test dates. Although D. cristata is not normally found in cucurbit blossoms, adults were attracted to traps containing shredded blossoms of Cucurbita maxima Duchesne ex Poir. Furthermore, all 4 Diabrotica species responded to a multicomponent synthetic lure (a cucurbit blossom mimic), suggesting a commonality of response to cucurbit blossom aroma. A review of the literature on Diabroticite chemical ecology suggests cucurbit volatiles acted evolutionarily as synomones, providing a primitive means of pollination for cucurbits. For several Diabrotica species, the olfactory response to these volatiles also may have facilitated the finding of noncucurbitaceous pollen sources.",1998
"Can wind pollination provide a selective benefit to mast seeding in Chionochloa macra (Poaceae) at Mt Hutt, New Zealand?",mast seeding; mass flowering; wind pollination; inbreeding depression; predator satiation; economies of scale; Chionochloa; Poaceae,REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PREDATION; PALLENS; MODELS; TREES; OAKS,"Mast seeding, which is very pronounced in Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand, could provide selective advantages through reduced seed predation or through more efficient wind pollination. The importance of wind pollination in favouring masting was tested experimentally by measuring the pollination success of Chionochloa macra individuals in 10 m x 10 m plots subject to a range of experimentally altered flowering densities within a single season. Very low local flowering densities produced a moderate but non-significant increase in the proportion of unfilled seeds (assumed to represent unsuccessful pollination). This result is consistent with the conclusions from between-year observational studies on Chionochloa pallens that wind pollination makes only a small contribution to any present selective benefit of masting in Chionochloa. However, masting may provide larger benefits from higher seed quality (reduced inbreeding depression) than from seed quantity.",1998

The sex ratio of reproductive individuals greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height was about 1:1 and departures from this ratio mostly resulted from a higher proportion of the males. Spatially, the sexes were randomly distributed but generally within 10 m of each other with no obvious gender differences in size. Throughout Malawi, male and female reproductive individuals flower synchronously between October-April (with a peak period in February-March). A 6: 1 male to female inflorescence sex ratio was common. Anthesis in female inflorescences lasts almost twice as long as in male inflorescences and only the latter have any odour. On male trees, inflorescences are in fascicles, whereas on female trees, they are solitary. In both cases, the infloresences are generally similar in size except for the peduncles of the male inflorescences which are longer than the female's. A range of insects visits U. kirkiana flowers but the most likely pollinators are bees (Apis mellifera), and beetles (Dothera bennigseni, Chelomenes lunata, Alcidodes denticulatus and Mitracamenta sp.). Apart from pollen from the male inflorescences, female flowers do not offer any obvious reward for flower visitors. Pollination studies revealed that assisted pollination did not significantly improve fruit production or seed quality over unpollinated or naturally pollinated inflorescences. Facultative agamospermy (apomixis) is suspected as a phenomenon requiring further attention in U. kirkiana.",1998
"Reproductive biology of the carrion-flower, Smilax herbacea (Smilacaceae)",Smilax herbacea; dioecy; sex ratio; pollination mechanisms; entomophily; fruit set; pollen limitation; resource limitation,SEX-RATIO; PLANTS; POLLINATION; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS,"Pollination biology, reproductive output, and population structure of male and female plants and flowers of Smilax herbacea were studied in nearly 900 individuals from 11 roadside populations in northeast-central Connecticut over a three-year period. Percentages of either sex did not vary across sites or between years. Reproductive plants represented 60% of an average population and nearly 65% of these were male. Female mortality is suggested as the most likely reason for the strong male bias (2.3 male:1 female). The male plants, although smaller, had twice the number of inflorescences, and 68% more flowers than female plants. Both inflorescence and flower number were significantly correlated with plant size in male plants. This correlation was absent for female plants implying that male plants are less constrained in the number of inflorescences and flowers they can produce. Although site size, population size, and population density of both female and male plants varied significantly across sites, gender and overall plant densities were not correlated with site size. However, a significant interaction was found between the densities of each sex and the site of their occurrence, suggesting that distribution of gender patterns may be influenced by site-specific ecological factors. Smilax herbacea can be characterized as a generalist in its attraction of pollinators. The carrion-like odor produced in tepals of male and female flowers, and the pollen reward of the staminate flowers attract bees, beetles, and flies. Due primarily to their high mobility and good pollen carrying capacity, andrenid and halictid bees and anthomyiid and stratiomyiid flies are considered major pollinators. Minor pollinators include soldier (Cantharidae), long-homed (Cerambycidae), and fire-colored (Pyrochroidae) beetles. Overall fruit set was lower in 1995 than in 1994 or 1996; this likely was due to unusually wet conditions that year. No significant difference in fruit set among populations was detected. Less than 1% of intrapopulational fruit set variation was explained by either site size or by plant density. Male plant densities were not significantly correlated with fruit set across sites. Furthermore, experimental interpopulational crosses did not significantly increase fruit set. These facts imply resource rather than pollen limitation in female plants.",1998

The flight activity correlated positively with temperature, light intensity, solar radiation, nectar-sugar concentration and negatively with relative humidity. Bees were generally most active between 12oo-14ooh. Path coefficient analysis revealed whether the relationship expressed by simple correlation was direct or indirect. Of the five factors studied, only relative humidity and solar radiation were found to influence flight activity directly.",1998

Gentianella germanica is self-fertile, but pollinators are essential for the transport of pollen ro the stigmas. In caged and untouched flowers the mean seed set was reduced to less than 30%. However, the ability of auto-deposition of pollen on the stigma varied between individuals (0-90%). The reduced seed set after hand-selfing in one population indicates some inbreeding effects on ovule or seed abortion, but in the other population no inbreeding depression was observed. This population had an overall lower seed set and seed number per fruit. Despite the favourable nutrient conditions, and higher number of ovules per flower in this population, there was apparently a limit to the number of seeds that could be matured per fruit. There was no evidence for pollination limitation in either population. A comparison of autofertility and ovule production per flower with several other gentian species differing in life history confirmed the hypothesis that the annual and most gentians are selfers and the perennials predominant outcrossers. Hence, particularly the perennial gentian species risk reductions of reproductive success and inbreeding depression owing to habitat fragmentation and pollination limitation. In contrast to other biennials, G. germanica was more similar to the perennial species, because of its poor autofertility. The possible role of herkogamy and dichogamy in the varying ability of individuals to self-pollinate spontaneously is discussed, and will tie studied in the near future.",1998

Floral scent and pollination in Browneopsis disepala (Leguminosae : Caesalpinioideae) in western Ecuador,Leguminosae; Browneopsis; floral scent; floral development; bat pollination; moth pollination; mixed pollination system,ORCHIDACEAE; MORPHOLOGY; CHEMISTRY; MOTHS,"Aspects of the pollination ecology of Browneopsis disepala, including floral scent composition, were studied. Floral scent was collected with head space techniques and analyzed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Inflorescence and flower development were followed, and amount and concentration of nectar measured. Flower-visiting animals were observed nocturnally and diurnally. Inflorescences of B. disepala emit a floral scent that is typical of neither moth-nor bat-pollinated plants, but contains some compounds related to both pollination types. Nectar is produced in quantities and with sugar concentrations falling within a range typical of both moth-and bat-pollinated plants. The inflorescences are visited by both moths and bats, but the behavior of the bats suggests that they are the more efficient pollinators. Browneopsis disepala has a mixed pollination system and is dependent on animals for pollination.",1998
Temporal and spatial variation in abundances of native bee species on an altitudinal gradient in southern Tasmania,,POLLINATION MECHANISMS; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY,"Bee assemblages were investigated in heathy coastal forest, shrubby dry sclerophyll forest, and shrubby subalpine forest near Hobart, in southern Tasmania, during spring, summer, and autumn between September 1996 and October 1997. Several taxa previously unknown from the state were encountered, including the first Tasmanian records of the halictid subfamily Nomiinae. Assemblages varied both temporally and spatially. Temporal variation within particular vegetation types was due to interspecific differences in flight periods. Spatial variation resulted from most species being restricted to one or two of these vegetation types, with species richness being substantially lower in the subalpine area than the two vegetation types at lower altitude. This variation also involved several species being more or less restricted to one habitat. In particular, Lasioglossum (Austrevylaeus pertribuarium) was a subalpine specialist while numerous species were more or less restricted to either coastal or dry sclerophyll forests. There was also an interaction between these two forms of variation, in the form of divergence in the flight periods of individual species in different vegetation types.",1998

Compatibility of crosses between gene pools and evolutionary classes in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),Andean region; genetic divergence; lethal gene; Mesoamerica; pollination; wild relative,VARIABILITY; WILD; WEAKNESS; FABACEAE,"The extent of genetic divergence between the Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools and between evolutionary classes (wild, landrace and bred) in Phaseolus vulgaris was explored. The compatibility of crosses was assessed by the frequency with which pollination was successful and the number of seeds in the resulting pod. Mesoamerican genotypes were more effective as pollinators than Andean genotypes, regardless of the gene pool of the female parent. Though certain individual genotypes were more easily pollinated by genotypes of one or other of the gene pools, there was no consistent tendency for pollinations between genotypes within a gene pool to be more successful than those between gene pools. In crosses among wild and landrace genotypes, the landrace genotypes were more easily pollinated. In those among wild and bred genotypes, the bred genotypes were more effective as pollinators, and the number of seeds per pod was greater in crosses between the evolutionary classes than in those within classes. In crosses among landrace and bred genotypes, those within evolutionary classes had higher success rates than those between classes (47.2% vs. 38.9%), and produced more seeds per pod. However, these results do not represent a major barrier between the evolutionary classes. The hypothesis that dwarf-lethal incompatibility in inter-gene pool crosses is controlled by two complementary dominant genes (the DL-gene hypothesis) was tested by comparing the numbers of normal and abnormal plants in the progeny of three-way crosses, and the ratios obtained were consistent with the hypothesis. It is concluded that there is no biological barrier between the two gene pools and that they are distinct because, by accident of ancestry, they are located in geographically isolated and ecologically distinct areas, with different cultural practices and preferences. Research programmes aimed at transferring desirable traits between the gene pools should therefore be encouraged.",1998

Their abundance, pollen load, and behaviour are reported. Cedronella canariensis was facultatively autogamous. The P:O ratio was higher than expected for a plant with a breeding system of this nature. Seed set was not pollen-limited. Selfed and outcrossed seeds differed in weight. Small, lightly coloured flowers with dysfunctional stamens appeared towards the end of the season. This male-sterility might be induced by drought.",1998

(Hypoxidaceae), a perennial herb with hermaphroditic flowers, was studied to check the relations between reproductive system, life form, habitat, pollination system and other morphological and ecological features. The study was done in a secondary deciduous forest with a population of 150-200 plants. Controlled pollinations were done in twenty isolated plants. The results pointed out that H. decumbens is an autogamous species, with outbreeding depression apparently reflecting environmental adaptation of the autogamous genotypes. The main pollinators were generalist insects, like dipterans. If has functionally solitary and actinomorphic flowers, with well exposed floral parts, displayed approximately at the same height, and with inner and before anthesis dehiscence of the anthers. The biomass allocation was mainly to female structures, like fruits and seeds, which was reflected in a low male-female biomass ratio, and in high fruit and seed set. The pollen-ovule and the attraction-support biomass ratios were low, associated with autogamous species, which have reliable pollination. The dispersal unit is the seed and the dispersal syndrome is myrmecochory, with the infructescence prostrate over the soil, the fruit with gradual dehiscence and with lipid droplets and placental remains (also with lipid content) in the seed coat. This species has several structural and functional attributes that sustain a mixed mating system and, although the results indicate that most of the progeny is autogamous; it does not sacrifice the opportunity for out-crossing.",1998
Floral biology of the distylous Mediterranean shrub Jasminum fruticans (Oleaceae),,DECODON-VERTICILLATUS LYTHRACEAE; EVOLUTION; PONTEDERIACEAE; POLLINATION; PATTERNS; FLOWERS; ECOLOGY,"Various aspects of the reproductive biology of two populations of the distylous shrub Jasminum fructicans (Oleaceae) in the northwest Iberian Peninsula were studied during 1994 and 1995. This species is a 'tropical' relict of pre-Miocene origin. Two morphs (the L morph with long-style/short-pistil, and the S morph with short-style/long-pistil) occur. Our results indicate that morph frequency ratio in the study populations is one-to-one. Experimental crosses revealed self-incompatibility, very weak within-morph compatibility and strong between-morph compatibility (in all cases as is typical of distylous species). Pollen grains are larger in S-morph plants, while both nectar reward and fruit set are higher in L-morph plants. However, no differences were detected in number of pollen grains per stamen or in pollinator spectrum (the most frequent visitors to flowers of both morphs being species of the hymenopteran genera Anthophora, Melecta and Bombus).",1998

Similarities and differences with the most closely related species (S. auriculata Loefl, ex L. and S. viciosoi Ortega-Olivencia & Devesa) are indicated, and ecological and distribution data are provided. The new species displays a high degree of polyploidy (2n = 56), and has palynological characteristics similar to those of other species in this genus. The new species shows protogynous dichogamy and produces considerable amounts of nectar in both sexual phases. Nectar secretion was maximum during the early hours of the morning. Mean longevity of the flowers was 2.66 days. Both nectar secretion and floral longevity correlated strongly with mean daytime air temperature. Pollination experiments showed that interaction with pollinators is necessary for reproduction, and gametophytic homomorphic self-incompatibility was documented. This feature was confirmed by observation of pollen tubes after hand self-pollination. The seed/ovule ratio was very low. ",1998

Foraging ecology and non-destructive control of the bat, C. sphinx, was studied at the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Bangalore. Bat damage was found to be positively correlated with fruit maturity and it begins at least a fortnight prior to harvest, when fruits start maturing. Peak damage was recorded 8 days prior to harvest. Damage was significantly higher where open space, adjacent to the vineyard, was available and lower on the vines closest to a mango orchard, 10 m away from the vineyard. It was inferred that growing trees around the vineyard may deter bat foraging. Erecting around-bower nylon netting (5 x 5 cm, mesh) from ground level to bower height, did not prevent bat damage. In addition to erecting around-bower netting, erecting within-bower netting tin a zigzag manner) to obstruct flight within the orchard, also did not appreciably reduce the bat damage. This study also showed that vines closer to open space had more bat damage than vines which were adjacent to physical barriers like trees and mango orchards. The best management strategy was found to involve erecting the nylon netting around-bower plus covering canopy gaps on the bower with twigs and briers; this gave effective control of the bat in four seasons of trial. This treatment is both nondestructive and cheap. The bat's useful role as a pollinator of forest trees is thus not compromised.",1998
Impact of El Nino and logging on canopy tree recruitment in Borneo,,SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; RAIN-FOREST; INDONESIA; KALIMANTAN; EVENT; VARIABILITY; POLLINATION; BIOMASS,"Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family of Bornean canopy trees, display the unusual reproductive strategy of strict interspecific mast-fruiting. During 1986-99, more than 50 dipterocarp species dispersed seed only within a 1- to 2-month period every 3 to 4 years during El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. Synchronous seed production occurred across extensive areas and was essential. for satiating seed predators. Logging of dipterocarps reduced the extent and intensity of these reproductive episodes and exacerbated Local El Nino conditions. Viable seed and seedling establishment have declined as a result of climate, Logging, and predators. Since 1991, dipterocarps have experienced recruitment failure within a national park, now surrounded by logged forest.",1999

Honeybees an useful as samplers of the environments in which they are kept and have been used to assess atmospheric and other types of pollution.

"Pollen dispersal models in Quaternary plant ecology: Assumptions, parameters, and prescriptions",,SOURCE AREA; ANGIOSPERM POLLEN; WIND POLLINATION; SPORE DISPERSAL; REPRESENTATION; DEPOSITION; CANOPY; FOREST; ASSEMBLAGES; VEGETATION,"Models of atmospheric dispersal of anemophilous pollen are important tools in Quaternary plant ecology for determining pollen-source areas and for applying distance-weightings to vegetation data in formal pollen-vegetation calibrations. The most widely applied model is Prentice's model, which uses a modified form of Sutton's equation for atmospheric diffusion to predict pollen-source areas from size of the depositional basin and a set of depositional parameters (deposition velocity of the pollen grains and mean windspeed) and atmospheric parameters (turbulence parameter, vertical diffusion coefficient). We review the physical theory underlying Sutton's equation and Prentice's model, explore the effects of different values of the depositional and atmospheric parameters on model predictions, and provide prescriptions for model application, parameter specification, and further research on pollen dispersal. Most applications of the models to pollen dispersal have assumed neutral atmospheric conditions. We argue that most pollen dispersal takes place in unstable atmospheric conditions, and prescribe appropriate values for the atmospheric parameters for unstable conditions. Our simulations using these parameters indicate more widespread pollen dispersal from a source than under neutral conditions. We review available data sets for sedimentation velocity of pollen grains, and compare the measured estimates with sedimentation velocities predicted from Stokes's Law to assess validity of the data. Substantial variability exists among data sets, but several are suitable for application to pollen-dispersal models. Finally, we discuss aspects of release, dispersal, and deposition of anemophilous pollen that are in need of further theoretical and empirical study. Such studies will contribute not only to Quaternary plant ecology but also to understanding of pollination biology, population genetics, and functional morphology of pollen grains and pollen-bearing organs.",1999

Covariance and decoupling of floral and vegetative traits in nine neotropical plants: A re-evaluation of Berg's correlation-pleiades concept,"adaptation; correlated evolution; correlation pleiades; evolution, floral traits; genetic correlation; natural selection; pollination; quantitative genetics",QUANTITATIVE GENETIC-ANALYSIS; POLLINATION EFFICIENCY; CORRELATION PATTERNS; PIERIS BUTTERFLIES; POLLEN CAPTURE; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; INTEGRATION; MORPHOLOGY; FLOWERS,"Nearly forty years ago R. L. Berg proposed that plants with specialized pollination ecology evolve genetic and developmental systems that decouple floral morphology from phenotypic variation in vegetative traits. These species evolve separate floral and vegetative trait clusters, or as she termed them, ""correlation pleiades."" The predictions of this hypothesis have been generally supported, but only a small sample of temperate-zone herb and grass species has been tested. To further evaluate this hypothesis, especially its applicability to plants of other growth forms, we examined the patterns of phenotypic variation and covariation of floral and vegetative traits in nine species of Neotropical plants. We recognized seven specific predictions of Berg's hypothesis. Our results supported some predictions but not others. Species with specialized pollination systems usually had floral traits decoupled (weak correlation; Canna and Eichornia) or buffered (relationship with shallow proportional slope; Calathea and Canna) from variation in vegetative traits. However, the same trend was also observed in three species with unspecialized pollination systems (Echinodorus, Muntingia, and Wedelia). One species with unspecialized pollination (Croton) and one wind-pollinated species (Cyperus) showed no decoupling or buffering, as predicted. While species with specialized pollination usually showed lower coefficients of variation for floral traits than vegetative traits (as predicted), the same was also true of species with unspecialized or wind pollination (unlike our prediction). Species with specialized pollination showed less variation in floral traits than did species with unspecialized or wind pollination, as predicted. However, the same was true of the corresponding vegetative traits, which was unexpected. Also in contrast to our prediction, plants with specialized pollination sg stems did not exhibit tighter phenotypic integration of floral characters than did species with generalized pollination systems. We conclude that the patterns of morphological integration among floral traits and between floral and vegetative traits tend to be species specific, not easily predicted from pollination ecology, and generally more complicated than R. L. Berg envisaged.",1999

However, we lack empirical evidence linking the reproductive assurance value of selfing in poor pollination environments to evolutionary shifts in mating system. Here, we investigated the adaptive significance of prior selfing in the polymorphic annual plant Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae), in which selfer populations occur only in areas of range overlap with congener A. glabra. To examine the hypothesis that secondary contact between the two species contributed to the evolution and maintenance of selfing, we used field competition experiments and controlled hand-pollinations to measure the female fitness consequences of pollinator-mediated interspecific interactions. Uniformly high fruit set by selfers in the naturally pollinated field arrays confirmed the reproductive assurance value of selfing, whereas substantial reductions in outcrosser fruit set (15%) and total seed production (20-35%) in the presence of A. glabra demonstrated that pollinator-mediated interactions can provide strong selection for self-pollination. Heterospecific pollen transfer, rather than competition for pollinator service, appears to be the primary mechanism of pollinator-mediated competition in Arenaria. Premating barriers to hybridization between outcrossers and A. glabra are extremely weak. The production of a few inviable hybrid seeds after heterospecific pollination and intermediate seed set after mixed pollinations indicates that A. glabra pollen can usurp A. uniflora ovules. Thus, any visit to A. uniflora by shared pollinators carries a potential female fitness cost. Moreover, patterns of fruit set and seed set in the competition arrays relative to controls were consistent with the receipt of mixed pollen loads, rather than a lack of pollinator visits. Competition through pollen transfer favors preemptive self-pollination and may be responsible for the evolution of a highly reduced floral morphology in A. uniflora selfers as well as their current geographical distribution.",1999

For a desert ecosystem, the region is characterized by a unique selective regime, namely highly predictable annual rainfall and a moderate temperature regime throughout the year. This selective regime is responsible for the unique plant ecological features of Namaqualand. These include: the dominance of communities by dwarf to low, shallow-rooted, short-lived and drought-sensitive leaf succulent shrubs; high abundance and diversity of geophytes; winter growth phenology; regular and spectacular spring flowering displays; rapid population turnover of perennials; weak competitive interactions; and high local and regional plant diversity. This paper provides a physiographical, biogeographical and ecological overview as background to this special issue. First, we outline the physiography and climate of Namaqualand, emphasizing unique components of its selective regime. Next we discuss the region's phytogeographical and floristic characteristics. Then we summarize what is known about plant form and function, focusing on growth form mix, phenology, carbon gain, water relations, and reproduction in vegetation dominated by leaf-succulent shrubs. Finally, we interpret Namaqualand's uniquely rich and dynamic plant communities in terms of plant functional processes. These plant ecological patterns and processes are discussed in terms of the predictions of a simple conceptual model for succulent-rich communities.",1999

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.",1999
Mechanisms of reduced Trillium recruitment along edges of old-growth forest fragments,,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SEED DISPERSAL; CONSERVATION; PLANT; REPRODUCTION; POLLINATION; POPULATION; LILIACEAE; PATTERNS; OVATUM,"Studies of plants in fragmented habitats have focused on single ecological processes, such as seed Production or seed dispersal, that may be altered by increased fragmentation and that operate as the mechanism(s) that increase extinction probability. We examined a suite of potential mechanisms to explain demographic shifts toward extinction in populations of Trillium ovatum, a long-lived herbaceous pcr perennial found in the understory of western North American conifer forests. Past work has shown that populations of T. ovatum within similar to 65 nz of forest-clearcut edges in southwestern Oregon have had almost no new recruitment since the edges were formed We hypothesized that changes in abiotic conditions and biotic interactions present along edges are responsible for reduced recruitment. In eight populations in eight separate fragments, we evaluated the relationship of distance of the populations to the forest edge with respect to six processes: flowering phenology (timing), seed production, pollination- and resource-limitation of seed set, seed dispersal, seed predation, and germination. Those factors that showed a significant relationship with edge distance were then compared with recruitment of younger age classes. Two processes were significantly different near edges and were highly correlated with decreased recruitment: decreased seed production due to changes in pollination and increased seed predation by rodents. Our study (in conjunction with previous studies) suggests that several ecological processes show no significant relationship with edge distance and can be eliminated as possible mechanisms of reduced recruitment: flowering phenology, resource-limitation of seed set, seed dispersal, germination, herbivory, and survivorship of established plants. Edges influence some but not all components of a plant's life history. Thus, determining shifts in only one part of a life history will be inadequate for testing the prediction of increasing extinction probabilities in fragmented landscapes. Future studies should include enough information to conduct comprehensive analyses, such as matrix projections and sensitivity analyses.",1999

Sequences were subjected to various alignments by changing the gap opening and extension parameters. After a preliminary parsimony analysis, the alignment with the lowest homoplasy indicators was chosen as optimal. The phylogenetic analysis, carried out on the optimal alignment by using Gennaria as an outgroup and a total of 31 taxa, showed that all the genera considered in this study are nested in Orchis despite their distinct morphological features. Genus Orchis is divided into two major clades, each of which includes one or more of the other genera in this study. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis does not match previous conclusions based on vegetative and floral morphology of the taxa involved but is congruent with isoenzyme, karyological, and chloroplast DNA restriction data. Our results indicate that floral morphology is highly flexible and current generic and infrageneric limits are artificial. Even if some floral characters closely correspond to the molecular data, most are highly homoplastic and thus unsuitable for phylogenetic reconstruction. Various traits pertaining to floral morphology may be interpreted as a result of ecological convergence related to pollinator-mediated selection; such characters can undergo drastic modifications without correspondingly dramatic genetic changes.",1999

However, little is known about their reproductive biology, genetic structure, and the ecological and genetic factors affecting this structure. Comparative studies of various mangrove species are needed to fill such gaps in our knowledge. The pollination biology outcrossing rate, and genetic diversity of Aegiceras corniculatum were investigated in this study. Pollination experiments suggested that the species is predominantly pollinator-dependent in fruit setting. A quantitative analysis of the mating system was performed using progeny arrays assayed for intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The multilocus outcrossing rate (t(m)) was estimated to be 0.653 in a wild population. Both allozyme and ISSR were used to investigate genetic variation within and among populations. The combined effects of founder events and enhanced local gene now through seedling dispersal by ocean currents apparently played an important role in shaping the population genetic structure in this mangrove species. Both allozyme variation (P = 4.76%, A = 1.05, H-E= 0.024) and ISSR diversity (P = 16.18%, A = 1.061, H-E = 0.039) were very low at the species level, in comparison with other woody plants with mixed-mating or outcrossing systems. Gene differentiation among populations was also low: allozyme G(ST) = 0.106 and ISSR G(ST) = 0.178. The unusually high genetic identities (0.997 for allozyme and 0.992 for ISSR loci), however, suggest that these populations are probably all descended from a common ancestral population with low polymorphism.",1999
The structure of a high latitude plant-flower visitor system: the dominance of flies,,MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS; POLLINATION; ECOLOGY; ASYMMETRIES; COMMUNITY; PHENOLOGY,"The species richness of insect flower visitors to all angiosperms at a subarctic-alpine site in northern Sweden was described and the plant-flower visitor matrix was analysed and compared to other high latitude systems and with systems from lower latitudes. In the habitat, 23 plant species had a total of 242 interactions with 388 flower-visiting insects, belonging to 118 taxa. Connectance of the plant-flower visitor matrix was 8.9. Comparing our findings with other studies, we get that the proportion of dipteran species of the total pollinator fauna increases with latitude but that the proportions of species of Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera do not vary significantly among high latitude systems. Muscidae and Empididae were more abundant and generalised than other dipteran families visiting flowers in the arctic, their proportions of the total Diptera fauna increase with latitude and they are the most widespread Families of flower-visiting insects in the arctic. Several Muscidae species are typical to alpine habitats in the arctic-subarctic zone. These species have special pollen feeding behaviour and an elongated proboscis, which improves access to closed flowers. Compared to other published pollination system studies, the connectance of low latitude systems ranges between 3.4 and 28.1, whereas high latitude and high altitude systems vary between 8.6 and 19 (-60).",1999
Ecological costs of plant resistance to herbivores in the currency of pollination,allocation costs; Brassica rapa; costs of resistance; ecological costs; herbivores; myrosinase; pollinators,WILD RADISH; BRASSICA-RAPA; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; CONSTRAINTS; ENVIRONMENT; SPECIALIST; CAMPESTRIS; SELECTION; GENOTYPE,"In this paper, we examine how ecological costs of resistance might be manifested through plant relationships with pollinators. If defensive compounds are incorporated into floral structures or if they are sufficiently costly that fewer rewards are offered to pollinators, pollinators may discriminate against more defended plants. Here we consider whether directional selection for increased resistance to herbivores could be constrained by opposing selection through pollinator discrimination against more defended plants. We used artificial selection to create two populations of Brassica rapa plants that had high and low myrosinase concentrations and, consequently, high and low resistance to flea beetle herbivores. We measured changes in floral characters of plants in both damaged and undamaged states from these populations with different resistances to flea beetle attack. We also measured pollinator visitation to plants, including numbers of pollinators and measures of visit quality (numbers of flowers visited and time spent per flower). Damage from herbivores resulted in reduced petal size, as did selection for high resistance to herbivores later in the plant lifetime. In addition, floral display (number of open flowers) was also altered by an interaction between these two effects. Changes in floral traits translated into overall greater use of low-resistance, undamaged plants based on total amount of time pollinators spent foraging on plants. Total numbers of pollinators attracted to plants did not differ among treatments; however, pollinators spent significantly more time per flower on plants from the low-resistance population and tended to visit more flowers on these plants as well. Previous work by other investigators on the same pollinator taxa has shown that longer visit times are associated with greater male and female plant fitness. Because initial numbers of pollinators did not differ between selection regimes, palatability and/or amount of rewards offered by high- and low-resistance populations are likely to be responsible for these patterns. During periods of pollinator limitation, less defended plants may have a selective advantage and pollinator preferences may mediate directional selection imposed by herbivores. In addition, if pollinator preferences limit seed set in highly defended plants, then lower seed set previously attributed to allocation costs of defense may also reflect greater pollinator limitation in these plants relative to less defended plants.",1999

Of the 21 trees studied, 17 flowered once or twice during the 6-y study period. The mass flowering and relatively high production of nectar per flower (mean of 310 mu l) resulted in a high nectar production (over 200 per tree per season). Flowers were visited by a wide range of nocturnal (bats, marsupials, night monkeys, hawk moths) and diurnal (bees, wasps, hummingbirds) animals, but only phyllostomid bats, especially Phyllostomus hastatus and Phyllostomus discolor, played a relevant role promoting cross-pollination, Pollinations which occurred in the early morning by diurnal floral visitors were ineffective since pollen tubes did not traverse the style and reach the ovary before stylar abscission. Despite the apparently normal growth of the self-pollen tubes, controlled pollinations carried out in one tree revealed no fruit set by selfing and 16.8% fruit set by crossing. Progeny analysis from this 'self-incompatible' tree using isozyme markers showed that fruits resulting from mixed-pollination (i.e., 50% self-plus 50% cross-pollen on the stigma) set only 1.6% of selfed seeds. The percentage of outcrossed seeds in fruits resulting from open-pollination in two neighbouring planted trees, which flowered in isolation and concomitantly, was estimated at 91% and 71%. Two isolated trees did not set any fruits despite massive flowering, whereas two others set large quantities of seed, supporting data in the literature stating that variable degrees of self-fertility may occur in this species.",1999
"Floral colour diversity in plant communities, bee colour space and a null model",flower colour; community ecology; pollination; divergence; colour vision,FLOWER COLORS; POLLINATION; COMPETITION; VISION; PREFERENCES; ECOLOGY,"Evolutionary biologists have long hypothesized that the diversity of flower colours we see is in part a strategy to promote memorization by pollinators, pollinator constancy and therefore, a directed and efficient pollen transfer between plants. However, this hypothesis has never been tested against a biologically realistic null model, nor were colours assessed in the way pollinators see them. Our intent here is to fill these gaps. Throughout one year, we sampled floral species compositions at five ecologically distinct sites near Berlin, Germany. Bee-subjective colours were quantified for all 168 species. A model of colour vision was used to predict how similar the colours of sympatric and simultaneously blooming flowers were for bees. We then compared flower colour differences in the real habitats with those of random plant communities. We did not find pronounced deviations from chance when we considered common plants. When we examined rare plants, however, we found significant divergence in two of the five plant communities. At one site, similarly coloured species were found to be more frequent than expected, and at the other two locations, flower colours were indistinguishable from a random distribution. These results fit theoretical considerations that rare plants are under stronger selective pressure to secure pollination than common plants. Our study illustrates the power of linking such distinct biological traditions as community ecology and the neuroethology of bee vision.",1999

Although the species has been reported to be pollinated by thrips in Peninsular Malaysia, our observations of Bower visitors and pollination experiments indicated that beetles (Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae, Coleoptera) contributed to pollination of S. parvifolia in Sarawak. Beetles accounted for 74% of the Bower visitors collected by net-sweeping, and 30% of the beetles carried pollen, while thrips accounted for 16% of the visitors, and 12% of the thrips carried pollen. The apical parts of the petals and pollen served as a reward for the beetles. Thrips stayed inside the flower almost continuously after arrival, and movements among flowers were rare. Fruit set was significantly increased by introduction of beetles to bagged flowers, but not by introduction of thrips. Hand-pollination experiments and comparison of fruit set in untreated, bagged, and open flowers suggested that S. parvifolia was mainly outbreeding.",1999

The development of cladistic approaches, combined with the emergence of molecular systematics, has resulted in an explosion of phylogenetic studies and an increase in interdisciplinary approaches combining ecological and systematic methodology. These new approaches offer the possibility of testing explicit hypotheses about the number of evolutionary transitions in reproductive characters and the evolutionary relationship of these characters to changes in the environment. Character mapping may be especially useful for detecting convergent evolution. In a number of cases, character mapping has provided new insights into the evolution of plant breeding systems and pollination biology, especially in suggesting the number of times evolutionary transitions have taken place, indicating where there have been reversals and suggesting when preadaptation has been important. The insights provided by character mapping are determined by a number of factors, including the degree of confidence in phylogenies underlying these studies and the identification of appropriate outgroups. Assumptions about character coding, character ordering, inclusion vs. exclusion of characters that are mapped on trees in the data matrix, and weighting of characters will have profound effects on interpretation of character evolution. Highly labile characters that evolve frequently and have the potential to undergo reversals may make it difficult to detect the pattern of character evolution. Characters that are very strongly correlated with each other or with ecological shifts may make prediction of cause and effect using phylogenetic approaches difficult because changes in characters and ecological shifts will occur, apparently simultaneously, on the same branches. Results from microevolutionary studies have been used in several cases to weight transitions, suggesting that results of phylogenetic studies may not provide fully independent assessments of character evolution. While not a simple cure to understanding problems that have been studied only in the realm of microevolutionary studies, phylogenetic approaches offer clear potential for providing new insights for evolutionary studies.",1999

Reproductive phenology, tree size at the onset of reproduction, and fecundity of 11 sympatric, closely related Macaranga species were studied to investigate within-species variation in reproductive traits in relation to resource availability, and among-species variation in relation to other life-history traits (shade tolerance, seed size and maximum tree size, H(max)) and consequently the requirements for forest-gap colonization. Nine species reproduced in synchronous episodes, and two species reproduced continuously over 32 mo. Episodic reproduction was most intense in 1992 following a severe drought. For several species, reproductive trees had greater light availability, lower fecundity in lower light levels, and lower growth rates than nonreproductive trees, reflecting resource-limited reproduction. Among species, H(max) was negatively correlated with shade tolerance and seed size. Tree size at the onset of reproduction and fecundity was strongly linked to this axis of life-history variation, but phenological pattern was not. Absolute tree size at the onset of reproduction was positively correlated with H(max) and negatively correlated with shade tolerance. Relative size at reproductive onset was not correlated with shade tolerance or H(max). Fecundity ranged four orders of magnitude among species and was correlated positively with H(max) and negatively with seed size and shade tolerance. The interrelationships among these reproductive and other life-history traits are strongly correlated with the species' requirements for gap colonization.",1999

They possess receptor types with sensitivity peaks around 390 nm (violet receptor) and 610 nm (red receptor), in addition to the receptor types common in insects with sensitivity peaks at 360 nm (ultraviolet receptor), 440 nm (blue receptor) and 540 nm (green receptor). Multiple- and dual-choice experiments show that females of P. aegeus prefer to oviposit on substrata that look green to humans. A class of simple models is developed to describe this choice behaviour in terms of linear interactions between the different spectral types of photoreceptors, The green receptor has a positive influence, whereas the blue (and possibly the ultraviolet and violet) receptor and the red receptor have negative influences on the choice behaviour. Colour choice for oviposition is thus guided by a single chromatic mechanism. Caterpillars of P, aegeus grow faster an young leaves which, according to the model, should be preferred by females for oviposition, The importance of the red receptor for the discrimination between different green leaves is discussed in ecological and comparative contexts. Finally, in an evolutionary perspective, the possibility is discussed that colour vision systems like those of honeybees might have evolved as a combination of two or more such chromatic mechanisms.",1999

Honey bees accounted for over 90% of the visits to Lythrum salicaria. In medium-density plots, in one of the two study sites. there was 19% reduction in seed production in Eupatorium perfoliatum and more than 58% increase in the amount of Lythrum salicaria pollen on Eupatorium maculatum stigmas.

These pressure gradients generated vertical secondary flows that may have ecological significance for benthic fauna and aquatic macrophytes. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that secondary flows of up to 15% of the local longitudinal velocity were produced behind individual obstructions within a submersed plant-like or animal tube array and for conditions Like those found in aquatic canopies or colonies. Our observations support theoretical predictions based on a reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equations. confirming that the ascending how is controlled by a local balance of vertical pressure gradient, proportional to delta u(2)/delta z, and viscous stress. The secondary flows were shown To transport dye from the bottom to a height dictated by the in-canopy current speed and turbulence intensity. By extension. the ascending flows can potentially contribute to the advection of nutrients from sediments, where they have been regenerated by microbial processes, to areas higher in the canopy, where they can be used by epiphytes and macrophyte leaves. Pressure gradients generated near the stem base also produce pore-water exfiltration. The coupled pressure-driven exfiltration and vertical advection have the potential to control nutrient availability in the bed.",1999
How do species dominating in succession differ from others?,life history; man-made habitat; phylogenetic correction; species trait; succession,COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY; PLANT SUCCESSION; CLONAL PLANTS; LIFE-HISTORY; TRAITS; MECHANISMS; PATTERN,"Data on succession were collected from 15 seres starting on bare ground in man-made habitats (i.e. sites disturbed by various mining activities, bulldozed sites, ruderal urban sites, the exposed bottom of a destroyed water reservoir, and abandoned fields), all in the western part of the Czech Republic, Central Europe. The period for which the data on succession were available ranged from 12 to 60 yr. 56 species reaching dominance in some period of succession were selected (the criterion being: at least 25% cover in at least one year in any sere); they were compared for biological and ecological traits with other species participating in the seres (167 species with at least 25% cover in at least one year in any sere), and with the Central European flora as a whole. Significant differences between the species dominating in succession and others were found for the following traits: life form, life strategy, pollination mode, and ability of lateral spread. Dominant species differed from the regional flora in distribution of life strategies, pollination mode and immigration status. The results suggest that an 'ideal successional dominant' is a tall, wind-pollinated plant, often a geophyte capable of intensive lateral spread, requiring high nutrient supply and sufficient site moisture. The set of traits contributing to achieving dominance by a species in human-made habitats includes both features occurring independently of phylogenies (life strategy, pollination mode, plant height, moisture demands) and those which dominant species probably share due to their common ancestors (nutrient demands, capability of extensive lateral spread).",1999

We examined the relation between outcrossing and population size in eastern Ontario populations of Aquilegia canadensis. Experimental pollinations showed that the species is highly self-compatible, and can achieve full seed-set in the absence of pollinators via automatic self-pollination. We estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and parental inbreeding coefficients (F) from allozyme variation in naturally pollinated seed families for 10 populations ranging in size from 32 to 750 reproductive individuals. The proportion of seeds produced through outcrossing was generally low(mean = 0.29 +/- 0.02 SE) and varied widely among populations (range = 0.00-0.83). Accordingly, estimates of F were large (mean = 0.26 +/- 0.05) and significantly greater than zero in seven populations. As expected, four small populations (N < 40) outcrossed less (0.17 +/- 0.03) than six large populations (N > 90; 0.38 +/- 0.03). However, parental plants were not significantly more inbred in small than large populations (P = 0.18). There was no difference in the germination of seeds from hand self- and cross-pollinations. However, population genetic estimates of inbreeding depression for survival expressed from seed to reproductive maturity were very high (mean delta = 1 - relative fitness of selfed seed = 0.88 +/- 0.14). The combination of self-compatibility and automatic self-pollination makes the mating system of A. canadensis sensitive to variation in ecological factors that affect the likelihood of cross-pollination.",1999

The lowlands (5-90 m) harbour ten plant species in seven families, pollinated mostly by three glossophagine bat species. The highlands (1540-1600 m) harbour seven plant species in five families, pollinated by a single species of glossophagine. Bromeliads account for about 30% of the bat-pollinated species at each assemblage. Tube anti brush shapes prevail in the flowers at both sites. Corolla lengths averaged 26.8 and 37.2 mm, sugar concentrations in nectar averaged 15.0 and 18.1%, and nectar volumes averaged 150.8 and 167.0 mu l in the lowland and highland assemblages, respectively. The flowers are pollinated mostly by glossophagine bats during hovering visits, and the plants are visited in the trap-line foraging pattern. The plants bloom annually and both assemblages show a staggered continual flowering pattern. Flowering, seasonality was found at both sites, with flowering clustering in the drier season at the lowland site and in the wetter season at the highland site. The ratio between bat-pollinated and hummingbird-pollinated species is 0.24 at the lowland site and 0.23 at the highland one. These similar values indicate that additional studies on bat- and bird-pollinated assemblages are merited at other Atlantic rainforest sites. ",1999

Since the 1960s, prickly acacia, Acacia nilotica ssp. indica, has substantially increased in density and range to become one of Australia's worst tropical rangeland weeds. Although the plant has been classified as a noxious weed for more than 30 years, relatively little research on its biology or ecology occurred until the late 1980s. A program of introducing biological control agents commenced in 1980 and resulted in the release of two insects: one failed to establish and the other has failed to exert any control. We suggest that studies of the population dynamics of a weed should occur prior to implementation of biological control programs. These can be valuable to identify weaknesses that can be exploited and to focus the search for effective agents, thereby enhancing the success rate of biological control efforts. We examine the life history and dispersal mechanisms of A. nilotica with a view to understanding the relative sensitivity of the population to reductions in each lifestage, understanding the vulnerability of each lifestage to biological control, and prioritizing potential control points in the lifecycle. Seedlings and juveniles appear to be the most susceptible lifestages to target for control. They are relatively easy to kill and significant reductions in their numbers will reduce the overall weed status of the plant. ",1999

We test the hypothesis that, on average, pollen specialist bee species occur more predictably at their floral hosts than pollen generalist bee species. Taxonomic floral specialization reaches its extreme among species of solitary, pollen-collecting bees, yet few studies have considered how pollen specialization by floral visitors influences their spatial constancy. We test this hypothesis using an unusually diverse bee guild that visits creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), the most widespread, dominant plant of the warm deserts of North America. Twenty-two strict pollen specialist and 80 + generalist bee species visit Larrea for its floral resources. The sites we sampled were separated by 0.5 to > 1450 km, and spanned three distinct deserts and four vegetation zones. We found that species of Larrea pollen specialist bees occurred at more sites and tended to be more abundant than generalists. Surprisingly, spatial turnover was high for both pollen specialist and generalist bee species at all distances, and species composition of samples from sites 1-5 km apart varied as much as repeat samples made at single sites. Nevertheless, the pattern of bee species turnover was not haphazard. As distance among sites increased faunal similarity of sites decreased. Faunal similarities among sites within 250 km of each other were generally greater than if randomly distributed over all sites (the null model). No single ecological category of species (widespread, localized, Larrea pollen specialist, floral generalist) accounted for this spatial predictability. Evidently, concordant local distribution patterns of many ecologically diverse species contribute to the non-random spatial pattern. The ecological dominance of creosote bush does not confer obvious ecological advantages to its specialist floral visitors. Spatial turnover is comparable to that found for bee guilds from other biogeographic regions of the world and is not therefore limited to those bee species that inhabit highly seasonal climates, such as deserts. Philopatry and differences in bloom predictability among sites are probably more important causes for spatial turnover of bee species than are interspecific competition for nest sites or floral resources.

Some of these hypotheses deal with the proximate causes of masting (e.g. the climate hypothesis) but others are concerned mostly with ultimate, evolutionary explanations (e.g. the pollination efficiency hypothesis). 2 The seed production of three tree species, Abies bulsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, was followed over a 7-year period in an old-growth, cold temperate forest of north-eastern North America. The main objectives were to determine the extent of interannual variations in seed production, to investigate the relationship between viable and potential seed crop and crop efficiency, and to explore the effects of climate on seed production. 3 Potential and viable seed production varied significantly among years for all three species. However, the timing of dispersal remained the same regardless of the level of seed production. 4 Seed rain was spatially less heterogeneous in years of high seed production, suggesting that most trees were reproducing in such years. 5 Over the 7-year period, there was a significant concordance among species in their viable seed crop and crop efficiency, but not in their potential seed crop. Crop efficiency was positively correlated to potential seed crop for Abies and Betula, but not for Acer. 6 High seed production was related to warm, dry conditions in the spring of the previous year (i.e. at reproductive bud initiation) but to a moist summer in the year of seed maturation. 7 Masting in these three species thus appears to be controlled by several factors, including climate and pollination efficiency.",1999

However, in Alpine areas, large-scale distribution barriers as well as small-scale habitat heterogeneity could lead to geographical and temporal isolation, respectively. We investigated the genetic variation of Saxifraga oppositifolia from 10 populations of the Alps in southeastern Switzerland using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Based on the banding patterns of four RAPD primers, 84 polymorphic markers identified all 189 sampled individuals as being genetically different. The genetic variation was mainly found within populations (95%), whereas less than 5% was found among populations and among regions. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggested that population differentiation was highly significant. However, grouping populations differently into regions did not appear to result in a clear correspondence of genetic and geographical relatedness. Genetic variation did not significantly differ between populations of two elevational levels. This coincides with results of former pollination experiments that revealed a breeding system of S. oppositifolia which remains the same irrespective of the elevation. We assume that the high outcrossing rate, rare clonal reproduction, and some long-distance dispersal even among topographically separated populations are the crucial determinants for the pattern of genetic variation found in the investigated area.",1999

Surprisingly, no study has examined its role in species diversification and ecological distribution in relation to other life history traits. In this study, we examine to what extent polyploidy and the other traditionally examined biological traits (pollination mode, dispersal mode and growth form) account for ecological and taxonomic diversity in the flora of the Pyrenees. Fifty genera (in 22 angiosperm families) were classified according to ploidy level, growth form, pollination mode and dispersal mode, and 451 species and/or subspecies in these 50 genera were classified according to ploidy level and growth form. We examined the contribution of ploidy level, pollination and dispersal modes and growth form to (i) the ecological range of species and genera, i.e., the number of natural habitats (defined by a combination of ecological characteristics) where they occur, and (ii) the taxonomic diversity of the 50 genera. Ploidy level and dispersal mode had significant effects on the taxonomic diversity of the 50 genera. Taxonomic diversity, but not polyploidy per se, was significantly correlated with ecological range of genera. For individual species, diploids had a larger ecological range than polyploids, and herbaceous growth forms had wider ecological distributions than other growth forms. Our results indicate that polyploidisation may be a source of ecological diversification of genera, not by increasing the ecological range of particular polyploid species compared to diploids, but rather by creating taxonomic diversity that leads in some genera to a diversification of the habitats occupied by different ploidy levels. This observation is consistent with previous observations of ecological divergence of chromosomal races in some species in the Alps and in the Pyrenees. As found in other studies, species diversification in the studied flora appears to be greatly influenced by the occurrence of multiple dispersal modes, while ecological range of species or subspecies is significantly increased by the presence of herbaceous species.",1999

Its flowers, however, are subject to high levels of nectar robbing. I examined the floral visitor assemblage of M. bullata in a tropical montane wet forest in southwestern Colombia, focusing on the behavior of the visitors. I also rested far the presence of nocturnal pollination and the effects of nectar removal on new nectar production. The principal floral visitors were the nectar robbing hummingbirds Ocreatus underwoodii (19.1% of visits) and Chlorostilbon mellisugus (18.9%). Only two species of long-billed hummingbirds visited the Bowers of M. bullata as ""legitimate"" pollinators: Coeligena torquata (14.7% of visits) and Doryfera ludoviciae (14.3%). The remaining visits constituted nectar robbing by bees, butterflies, and other species of hummingbirds. Nocturnal pollination took place, although fruit set levels were 2.4 rimes higher when only diurnal pollination was allowed as opposed to exclusively nocturnal pollination. Nectar robbers removed floral nectar without pollinating the flower. Treatments of experimental nectar removal were carried out to examine if flowers synthesize more nectar after nectar removal. Nectar removal increased the total volume of nectar produced by each Bower without affecting sugar concentration. Thus, nectar robbing can impose a high cost to the plants by forcing them to replace lost nectar.",1999

Among the 29 species studied, eight were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae), 11 by medium-sized Amegilla bees (Anthophoridae), and ten by small halictid bees. These pollination guilds found in gingers in Sarawak are comparable to the pollination guilds of neotropical Zingiberales, i.e., hummingbird; and euglossine-bee-pollinated guilds. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that there were significant correlations between floral morphology and pollination guilds and suggests the importance of plant-pollinator interactions in the evolution of floral morphology. Most species in the three guilds were separated on the plot by the first and second canonical variables. Spiderhunter-pollinated flowers had longer floral tubes, while Amegilla-pollinated flowers had wider lips than the others, which function as a platform for the pollinators. Pistils and stamens of halictid-pollinated flowers were smaller than the others. The fact that gingers with diverse morphologies in a forest with high species diversity were grouped into only three pollination guilds and that the pollinators themselves showed low species diversity suggests that many species of rare understory plants have evolved without segregating pollinators in each pollination guild.",1999

The similarity between scents of male and female inflorescences was 76.5% in Ammandra, 84.2% in Aphandra, and >99% in Phytelephas. Different species of Aleocharinae (Staphylinidae) pollinate Aphandra natalia and Phytelephas species and reproduce in their male inflorescences. Derelomini (Curculinoidae) and Mystrops (Nitidulidae) only visit and pollinate Phytelephas in which male inflorescences they reproduce. A species of Baridinae (Curculionidae) only visits and pollinates Aphandra natalia, and reproduces in its female inflorescence. The apparent reliance on one or a few floral scent constituents as attractants and few and specific pollinators may indicate co-evolution. Sympatric species of Phytelephantoideae have different scents. We suggest that species with similar scents have allopatric distributions due to the absence of a pollinator isolation mechanism.",1999
The ecology of pollen limitation in buzz-pollinated Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae),bumblebee; insufficient pollination; pollen removal; poricidal anthers; reproductive ecology,SEED SET; BUMBLE BEES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; ERYTHRONIUM-GRANDIFLORUM; FLORAL MORPHOLOGY; POPULATION-SIZE; REMOVAL; DISPERSAL; PLANTS; CONSEQUENCES,"1 Pollen limitation of female fertility has often been documented in animal-pollinated plants, but seldom have the ecological mechanisms responsible been investigated. We examined factors influencing pollen limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination. Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 3-4-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatients) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.",1999
Pollination of Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae): Effects of intra- vs. interspecific competition,Castilleja linariaefolia; competition; density dependence; Ipomopsis aggregata; Polemoniaceae; pollination,PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SEED-SET; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; DELPHINIUM-NELSONII; POLLEN LIMITATION; MECHANISM; DENSITY; POPULATION; COMPONENTS; RESOURCE,"Although plants may simultaneously experience intra- and interspecific competition for pollination, their relative strength has rarely been experimentally evaluated. Yet because intra- and interspecific competition can be caused by different mechanisms, their effect on the ecology and evolution of plants may differ To determine the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition for pollination, I manipulated the presence of heterospecifics and density of conspecifics using Ipomopsis aggregata as the focal species. All plots contained I. aggregata and Castilleja linariaefolia, but C. linariaefolia inflorescences were removed from half of the plots to create the heterospecifics-absent treatment. Within each plot, all I. aggregata inflorescences were removed from a 5-m radius around a focal plant to create a low conspecific density experimental unit, and a group of 12 1. aggregata plants/1 m(2) was designated as a high conspecific density unit. Conspecific pollen deposition was reduced when C. linariaefolia was present but was not influenced by I. aggregata density. Although seed set per fruit was reduced by 17% when C. linariaefolia was present, it was not significantly influenced by either treatment. Interspecific competition for pollination is stronger than intraspecific competition in the I. aggregata-C. linariaefolia system, but neither process appears to influence plant fitness.",1999

Seven additional species were represented by physically intact, non-viable seeds. Over 90% of the persistent seed bank was concentrated in Montiopsis sericea (Portulacaceae), Pozoa coriacea (Umbelliferae), Phacelia secunda (Hydrophyllaceae) and Oxalis compacta (Oxalidaceae). Examination of the seed/cover ratio revealed different propensities for persistent seed bank formation among species. and annuals formed persistent seed banks more frequently than perennial species. Abundance in the standing vegetation had predictive value for abundance in the persistent seed bunk only when non-persistent seed bank species in the standing vegetation were discarded from the analysis. At the local scale, species diversity in the persistent seed bank and standing vegetation were correlated, but compositional similarity was low. Secondary down-slope dispersal promoted by frost heaving in combination with runoff and life-form correlates are discussed as possible factors accounting for poor correspondence between the persistent seed bank and the standing vegetation at a local scale. The high Andean seed bank is similar to or larger than that reported for two Arctic tundra sites, but smaller than for a northern hemisphere subalpine site. If seed bank size is considered in relation to plant cover, the Andean seed bank greatly exceeds that of one Arctic site. Our study constitutes the first demonstration of a sizable persistent seed bank at an alpine site in the South American Andes and in southern hemisphere temperate mountains in general.",1999

Species are differentiated by overall flower size and by corolla lobe size in relation to corolla tube opening size, characteristics implicated in pollination ecology. Saintpaulia has a very short corolla tube and yellow protruding anthers, strikingly different from Streptocarpus, and probably associated with buzz pollination. Some species of Streptocarpus and all species of Saintpaulia are enantiostylous, a feature often linked to buzz pollination. Mapping of these floral characters onto a molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequence data showed that in Streptocarpus flower size evolved from small to large, with reversals in four species. The putatively bee pollinated 'open-tubed' type had two independent origins, and the putatively lepidopteran-pollinated 'keyhole' type had four separate origins. Enantiostyly had one or two origins. The degree of zygomorphy varies within Streptocarpus/Saintpaulia. The most extreme difference is between Saintpaulia ionantha and a Saintpaulia peloric cultivar. The developmental basis of floral variation was compared using SEM in three very different types: Streptocarpus primulifolius, Saintpaulia ionantha and a Saintpaulia peloric cultivar. Differences in corolla tube length and zygomorphy are established very early in flower development. Small, early changes in flower development establish major changes in mature floral morphology.

It is considered a Species of Concern by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This study focused on the reproductive biology of the plant from Rower production through seed germination to identify possible weak points that might contribute to its rarity and impede its conservation. Most plants produced a large mean number of flowers and ovules (314.8 and 4106, respectively), but relatively few of these formed fruits and seeds (25.8 and 3.8%, respectively). In decreasing importance, ovules in fruits were lost to predation, seed abortion, and lack of fertilization. The percentages of these fates differed among sites and years. Excluding pollinators by bagging flowers reduced fruit set by similar to 50%, but seed set per fruit and seed mass were unaffected. Germination was affected by scarification, temperature, and moisture availability. About 11% of seeds damaged by predispersal seed predators (weevil larvae) remained viable and were released from dormancy. I hypothesize that predispersal seed predation (over 80% at one site) has a negative effect on population growth. Conservation of this species could benefit from improved fruit set and decreased seed predation.",1999

Ant and pollinator exclusion experiments elucidated both positive and negative effects of ant attendance on plant reproductive success, including pollination, fruit set, fruit loss, and fruit removal. Ants did not pollinate flowers but did contribute to higher pollination success, probably by increasing the relocation frequency of winged pollinators and thus the rate of flower visitation. Ants also prevented fruit loss to herbivorous insects which were common during the early stages of fruit development. Thus, ant attendance strongly improved both pollination and fruit set whereby plants with ants set more fruit per flower and also lost fewer fruits during fruit maturation. In contrast? ants had a negative effect on the removal of ripe fruits by avian frugivores. Thus, ant attendance has a non-trivial influence on plant reproduction, this interaction being beneficial at some stages of the plant reproductive cycle and carrying costs at another stage. A tight ecological or co-evolved relationship between these Ectatomma spp. and P. limonensis is unlikely given that ant attendance of plants is detrimental to fruit removal.",1999

The paper is mainly aimed at an audience of non-biologists to facilitate cooperation among disciplines. A list of services compiled from the literature is classified according to ecological criteria that relate to the properties of the services. These criteria are: (1) if the goods or services are produced and maintained within the ecosystem or shared with other ecosystems; (2) if the goods or object of the service are living or inorganic material; and (3) what biological unit is associated with production and maintenance, i.e. an individual, a species, a group of species, an entire community, the ecosystem, the landscape or on a global scale. Using these criteria I have identified and selected three major groups of ecosystem services for which some common ecological concepts apply. These are: (1) the maintenance of populations; (2) the use of ecosystems as filters of externally imposed compounds; and (3) the property of biological units to create organization through selective processes. These three categories are examined and exemplified in detail. ",1999

Here we present the first report on the pollination of Lowiaceae and describe a new system of dung-beetle pollination from Sarawak, Borneo. Orchidantha inouei has a zygomorphic flower located just above the ground. Observations revealed that the plant is visited frequently and is pollinated by scarabaeid dung beetles, mainly members of the genus Onthophagus. All four species of Onthophagus collected on O. inouei have also been caught using traps baited with dung or carrion in Borneo. Onthophagus was presumably attracted to the dung-like odor of the flower. Pollination of O. inouei is different from other examples of beetle pollination in that its flower provides neither reward nor protected space. Dung beetles are excellent at following a particular dung scent. Orchidantha is the only genus that includes species lacking floral nectar. It is interesting that this deception pollination using dung beetles was found in Zingiberales, in which all known species have mutual and specialized relationships with their long-distance, but costly, pollinators-bees, birds, and bats.",1999

Nectar secretion is holocrine and the nectar is released by rupture of the wall and cuticle of each epidermal cell. The nectaries of the two species differ in number and external morphology. In H. foetidus, secretion begins before anthesis and secretion Fate decreases with nectary age. In H. bocconei it begins on the day of anthesis and proceeds ata constant rate.

Sexual selection is most obvious when it favours the evolution of a trait which enhances mating success at the expense of decreased viability. We studied the relationship between floral display (number of inflorescences), pollinator attraction and plant survival in a dioecious shrub, Leucadendron xanthoconus. Pollinator attraction, measured as the number of insect pollinators, increased linearly with floral display in males. However, males with extravagant displays had a higher probability of dying. Our data suggest that male plants are undergoing selection on floral display for increased mating success counterbalanced by selection against plants with extravagant displays. Seed set in females did not increase with floral display, except at very low inflorescence numbers. Nor was female survival correlated with floral display. Because inflorescences are terminal in the species, selection for more inflorescences in males causes increased ramification, thinner terminal branches and smaller leaves. Thus vegetative dimorphism in this species appears to be caused by selection for extravagant floral display in males, but not females. Limits to dimorphism are imposed by survival costs of elaborate display.",1999

One of the most important parameters influencing the dynamics of these elements is the magnitude of their transmission advantage. In many systems, the mechanism of sex-ratio distortion is to abort X- or Y-bearing gametes. With this mechanism, the transmission advantage associated with sex-ratio distortion is diminished when the production of male gametes limits offspring production or when competition among the gametes of different males is intense. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of pollen competition between males that produced different sex ratios in the dioecious plant, Silene alba, and estimated how the sex-ratio bias influenced the transmission properties of the sex chromosomes. We varied the intensity of pollen competition by controlling the quantity of pollen used in crosses and used a combination of single-male pollinations and pollen mixtures to evaluate the effects of multiple paternity. Paternity in pollen mixtures was estimated using allozymes. Sex-ratio bias was directly influenced by the quantity of pollen, but the magnitude of this effect was small. The relative performance of pollen from different males varied substantially, especially when there was multiple paternity. Specifically, males with biased sex ratios sired far fewer offspring of either sex in pollen mixtures. In crosses involving single males, however, these ""sex-ratio"" males produced the same number of offspring as other males, so the female bias caused a significant transmission advantage for X-linked genes. X-linked genes could enhance their transmission via sex-ratio distortion in Silene populations, but the magnitude of this transmission advantage will depend on the ecological circumstances that influence the opportunity for multiple paternity.",1999
Molecular systematics of Australian Gossypium section Grandicalyx (Malvaceae),,CHLOROPLAST-DNA; EVOLUTION; COTTON; RECONSTRUCTION; SEQUENCE; ANTS,"Australian Gossypium consists of 17 species classified into three sections. The largest and most poorly understood is the group of 12 species in sect. Grandicalyx that occur in the Kimberley and Cobourg regions of NW Australia. These areas are characterized by annual monsoon rains and dry-season fires. Species in sect. Grandicalyx exhibit a suite of morphological and ecological features that are otherwise unknown in the genus and that apparently evolved in response to seasonal fires and ant mutualism. These features include an herbaceous perennial habit, the ability to regenerate from thickened rootstocks following fires and extended drought, pedicels that recurve following pollination so that the capsules are pendent and open inverted at maturity, and sparsely vestitured, ant-dispersed seeds that bear elaiosomes. To better understand the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the species in sect. Grandicalyx, we sampled widely within and among species and generated three sets of DNA sequences, i.e., for the plastid rpl16 intron, the nuclear 18S-26S ITS of rDNA, and an alcohol dehydrogenase gene. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that species in sect. Grandicalyx are monophyletic with little resolution within the dade. Sequence divergence is low in all pairwise comparisons among species, suggesting that the group radiated relatively recently perhaps in the late Pliocene-Pleistocene after an earlier (Miocene) divergence from the other extant Australian lineages. The palaeoclimatic record, sequence divergence estimates, and phylogenetic data suggest that diversification of the sect. Grandicalyx species arose via range fragmentation of a more widely distributed ancestor or ancestors. This evolutionary history was accompanied by the development of a prostrate to upright herbaceous, multistemmed habit, adaptation to seasonal fires, and a suite of features associated with myrmecochory.",1999
Sex allocation and local mate competition in Old World non-pollinating fig wasps,fig wasps; local mate competition; sex allocation; sex ratio; wing morphology,HIERARCHICAL SELECTION THEORY; MATING STRUCTURE; OFFSPRING ALLOCATION; RATIO; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; MUTUALISM; PHYLOGENIES; DIMORPHISM; ECOLOGY,"The populations of many species are structured such that mating is not random and occurs between members of local patches. When patches are founded by a single female and all matings occur between siblings, brothers may compete with each other for matings with their sisters. This local mate competition (LMC) selects for a female-biased sex ratio, especially in species where females have control over offspring sex, as in the parasitic Hymenoptera. Two factors are predicted to decrease the degree of female bias: (1) an increase in the number of foundress females in the patch and (2) an increase in the fraction of individuals mating after dispersal from the natal patch. Pollinating fig wasps are well known as classic examples of species where all matings occur in the local patch. We studied non-pollinating fig wasps, which are more diverse than the pollinating fig wasps and also provide natural experimental groups of species with different male morphologies that are linked to different mating structures. In this group of wasps, species with wingless males mate in the local patch (i.e. the fig fruit) while winged male species mate after dispersal. Species with both kinds of male have a mixture of local and non-local mating. Data from 44 species show that sex ratios (defined as the proportion of males) are in accordance with theoretical predictions: wingless male species < wing-dimorphic male species < winged male species. These results are also supported by a formal comparative analysis that controls for phylogeny. The foundress number is difficult to estimate directly for non-pollinating fig wasps but a robust indirect method leads to the prediction that foundress number, and hence sex ratio, should increase with the proportion of patches occupied in a crop. This result is supported strongly across 19 species with wingless males, but not across 8 species with winged males. The mean sex ratios for species with winged males are not significantly different from 0.5, and the absence of the correlation observed across species with wingless males may reflect weak selection to adjust the sex ratio in species whose population mating structure tends not to be subdivided. The same relationship is also predicted to occur within species if individual females adjust their sex ratios facultatively. This final prediction was not supported by data from a wingless male species, a male wing-dimorphic species or a winged male species.",1999

On the other hand, most insectivorous plants depend on free-moving, live insects as pollen vectors for sexual reproduction. In Pinguicula vallisneriifolia Webb, the spatial and temporal coincidence between flowers and the first distal leaves presents a potential conflict between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. To examine this possibility, I combined an extensive regional survey to identify the pollinator assemblages and to analyze prey capture with a local intensive study to investigate the mechanisms of interference between the two systems. I analyzed the possible conflicting functions of pollination vs. insectivory under contrasting abiotic scenarios. Field observations and experiments confirmed the pollinator role of small flower visitors and the interference between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. The degree of this interference is determined by the size and foraging behavior of pollinators, given that only small pollinators become entangled on leaves. Plants in bloom had a greater probability of capturing thrips than did plants without flowers. Because P. vallisneriifolia is pollen limited, the capture of small pollinators depleted the availability of the resource that limited plant reproduction. The pollinator-prey conflict is, however, environment specific, because the shadiness of the microsite where the plant grows determines both the distribution and abundance of different-sized insect species and the retention capacity of the mucilage. The present results indicate that plant-pollinator and plant-prey interactions can be strongly determined by species-specific ecophysiological responses of flying insects and sessile plants to abiotic characteristics of the environment. The physical environment affects the outcomes of plant-animal interactions and, ultimately, the balance between mutualistic and antagonistic systems.",1999

In either case, the learned disc was tested against each of a series of ten discs whose colour differed in either the upper or the lower half. A comparison between the results obtained in the two experiments reveals that colour discrimination is significantly better in the lower half of the frontal eye region than it is in the upper half. The results, similar to earlier results obtained in pattern discrimination tasks, cannot be explained by peripheral eye-region-specific specializations. It is proposed that the functional significance of the lower frontal visual field is based on more central neural mechanisms that might constitute an adaptation to the forager's natural needs.",1999

Flowers on large plants received an equal number of visits from bumblebees as flowers an small plants. On large plants more flowers in a row were visited, inducing geitonogamy. The overall relationship between selfing rate and number of flowers can be explained by pollen dynamics and pollinator behaviour without invoking postpollination processes such as differential pollen tube growth and abortion.",1999

Here, we examined how pollinator oviposition in relation to these traits affected annual fitness (seed output) of single- and multi-flowered Trollius europaeus along altitudinal gradients in subarctic Sweden and the French Alps. Small flies (Chiastocheta spp.) pollinate T. europaeus and their larvae feed on developing seeds. Assuming that late flowers in multi-flowered plants attracted flies to the earliest flower on the same plant, we expected more eggs and higher seed predation in early multiple flowers than in single flowers. Relative seed predation would thereby increase with flower number. Both in Sweden and the Alps, more eggs were placed on large flowers. Early multiple flowers were slightly larger than single flowers, and about twice the size of secondary flowers. As a result, and possibly combined with the effects of secondary flowers, early multiple flowers attracted more ovipositing flies and experienced relatively higher seed predation. However, this did not generally result in higher seed predation of multi-flowered hosts. Multiple flowers had greater seed output than single flowers at all altitudes, also in the high alpine and subarctic sites, where single flowers were more abundant. We hypothesise that the distribution of multiple flowers generally is enforced by environmental factors, rather than by fly-host plant interactions, because only very rarely tin triple-flowered alpine plants) was seed predation disproportionate, and the relationship skewed to the disadvantage of the host. The outcome of the mutualistic interaction was often similar in alpine and subarctic populations, but the underlying factors were different. Subarctic flowers had high abortion and low predation rates, while alpine flowers experienced the reversed situation. The higher fly abundance in the Alps suggests a more intense mutualistic interaction than in Sweden. Despite varying ecological and environmental conditions at these sites, the mutualistic relationship was generally in balance. However, when it was unbalanced, this could be explained by fly behaviour in response to floral traits, and by differences in fly abundance.",1999

We tested for significant effects of population size on these characteristics, for relationships between stigma pollen loads and fruit and seed set, and for significant variation between years in reproductive characteristics. In 1994 stigma pollen loads were inversely related to population size and were significantly lower than in 1993. The lower stigma pollen loads in 1994 were associated with adverse weather conditions thigh rainfall), which are known to affect pollinator activity and may have led to competition among plants for pollinators in large populations. However, population size was not correlated with percentage of fruit set or percentage of seed set in either pear. The lack of fruit and seed set differences between large and small populations, particularly in 1994, likely resulted from the small amount of pollen needed to trigger fruit and seed production. Our results indicate that for some self-compatible species that similarly require small pollen loads, the effects of population size on reproduction are minimal, even if differences in pollen-movement exist between large and small populations.",1999
Pollination mechanism in southern Brazilian orchids which are exclusively or mainly pollinated by halictid bees,"Orchidaceae, Campylocentrum, Cyclopogon, Prescottia, Halictidae; bee pollination, flower morphology",MADAGASCAR; SYSTEMS,"The pollination process is documented in three sympatric orchids found in Curitiba, Parana State, southern Brazil. In Campylocentrum aromaticum (Epidendroideae: Angraeciinae) and Prescottia densiflora (Spiranthoideae: Prescotiinae) halictid bees act as main pollinators with minor contributions from other insects, such as Syrphid flies. Because of the pollinarium and column structure in Cyclopogon diversifolius. (Spiranthoideae, Spiranthinae), halictid bees are the only insects capable of performing pollination. In the three studied species pollinarium removal and deposition are achieved by interaction between the column and bee's mouth parts. Morphological and ecological flower features in agreement with this pollination mode are discussed and pollination by halictid bees is suggested to occur in a number of South American orchids.",1999
The pollination ecology of buzz-pollinated Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae),bumble bee behavior; floral color change; Melastomataceae; phenology; pollen limitation; Rhexia virginica; specialization,FLORAL COLOR-CHANGE; POLLEN-COLLECTING BUMBLEBEES; FRUIT-SET; PLANTS; FLOWERS; PATTERNS; BEES; BORAGINACEAE; ATTRACTION; MORPHOLOGY,"We examined the function of floral traits associated with buzz pollination through studies of Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae) in the Muskoka region of Ontario, Canada. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that the species is self-compatible. but dependent on insects for pollen transfer Bumble bees made 82 and 90% of observed insect visits to R. virginica in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and effectively buzzed flowers. Buzz pollination did not appear to be highly ""specialized"" since various species of bumble bee were capable of pollination, and pollen transfer efficiency appeared to be relatively low. Experimental manipulations provided little support for the hypothesis that the yellow color of melastome anthers mimics abundant pollen, thereby deceiving pollinators to visit regardless of whether most pollen has been removed. Fruit set averaged 52.6% among populations, owing largely to infrequent pollinator visits and pollen limitation. Flowers of R. virginica were infertile after a single day of anthesis, but petals were subsequently maintained for 1-2 d and stamens underwent a color change from bright yellow to red. Second-day flowers may function to increase floral display size and hence fertility, without a concomitant increase in pollen discounting. Studies of bumble bee foraging behavior and correlates of seed set provided indirect support for this hypothesis.",1999
Pollen aperture heteromorphism. Variation in pollen-type proportions along altitudinal transects in Viola calcarata,Viola calcarata; insect pollination; pollinator activity; pollen aperture heteromorphism; altitudinal transects; Violaceae,POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM NUTT; HIGH TEMPERATE ANDES; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; VISITATION RATES; CENTRAL CHILE; POLYMORPHISM; SCENT,"Some species produce pollen grains with different aperture numbers within a single individual (pollen aperture heteromorphism). In the pansy Viola diversifolia, aperture number is positively correlated with pollen germination speed, and negatively correlated with viability. In V calcarata, young five-aperturate pollen grains germinate faster than four-aperturate ones. Heteromorphism could thus be favoured when pollination is unpredictable, as plants produce both very competitive and long-lived pollen grains. Depending on the efficiency of the pollinators, different proportions of pollen types will be optimal. In insect-pollinated species, such as V:calcarata, pollination efficiency generally decreases as elevation increases. We therefore expect a decrease in mean aperture number as altitude increases. This was found in four transects tout of six). Pollinator activity therefore has a potential impact on pollen morphology. ",1999
Pollination ecology of Chloranthus serratus (Thunb.) Roem. et Schult. and Ch-fortunei (A. Gray) Solms-Laub. (Chloranthaceae),Chloranthaceae; Chloranthus; Thysanoptera; flowering; floral-axial chamber; pollination; evolution trends,PRIMITIVE ANGIOSPERMS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; WINTERACEAE; RADIATION,"Flowering and pollination biology of Chloranthus serratus and Chloranthus fortunei were studied. Flowering took place from early March to mid-April in Ch. fortunei, and from April to September, the whole growth period, in Ch. serratus. The flowering period of an inflorescence of Ch. serratus averaged about 8 d and anthesis of a single flower was 5-6 d. Flowers are slightly protogynous. The flower emitted fragrance when the androecium became white. Both species are entomophilous with thrips as exclusive pollinators. Under natural conditions, fruit set occurs mainly as a result of cross-pollination, but self-pollination and agamospermy may occur in some cases. In flowers of Ch. fortunei and Ch. serratus, the incurved androecium, the carpel and the spike axis form a nearly closed chamber that contains the anthers and stigma. The development of a floral-axial chamber may be an important step towards a more economical and effective pollination system. Floral morphology, pollination biology and fossil evidence suggest that the main evolutionary trend in the genus Chloranthus is towards development of 'closed' flowers. The fidelity of the relationship between Chloranthus and thrips is regarded as a specialized feature of pollination biology and this relationship may have originated early in the evolutionary lineage.",1999
Joint effects of feeding and breeding behaviour on trophic dimorphism in hummingbirds,coevolution; lek paradox; natural selection; plumage coloration; sex roles; sexual selection,DNA HYBRIDIZATION EVIDENCE; PHYLOGENETIC PATTERNS; SEXUAL DICHROMATISM; HERMIT HUMMINGBIRDS; FEMALE HUMMINGBIRD; TROCHILIDAE; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; POLYCHROMATISM; ECOLOGY,"A survey of 166 hummingbird species reveals novel associations of bill-length sexual dimorphism (BLSD) with plumage and breeding behaviours. Across all species, female bills become proportionately longer than male bills (higher female-to-male BLSD ratio) as sexual dichromatism increases. However, male bills are proportionately longer (lower female-to-male BLSD ratio) in both lekkers (traditional group display) and clustered breeders (female harems or colonial nests) compared with dispersed breeders. The overall positive association of plumage with BLSD suggests that social status determines priority of access to nectar-providing flowers. Furthermore, the distinctive BLSD associated with breeding aggregations may arise fr om behaviours that impose constraints on the usual male priority at flowers: female dominance over males around nest colonies and male residence on lek-mating territories. These various factors appear to alter plumage and bill characters of both sexes to produce the range of dimorphisms within the various dispersed and aggregated breeding system categories. Feedback loops caused by ecological consequences of breeding behaviour may alter the evolutionary dynamics of breeding systems, bird-plant interactions, and competing pollinators, as well as help explain the lek paradox.",1999
Does flower color change in Aster vimineus cue pollinators?,,FLORAL COLOR; FUCHSIA-EXCORTICATA; FABACEAE; ECOLOGY; VISITS,"Flower color change, floral rewards. and the size of a floral display in relation to pollinator attraction were studied in Aster vimineus. The center disk florets of A. vimineus are either all yellow or all red in a given flower. We determined that this variation in disk color was due to localized color change from yellow to red. Yellow florets contained more pollen and a greater percentage of viable pollen than red florets. All pollinator types consistently preferred flowers with yellow disks over those with red disks. The addition of nectar did not influence pollinator visitation rates, unless the pollinators were choosing only among flowers with red disks. Retention of the flowers with red disks allowed for greater floral display which increased pollinator visitation rates.",1999
Interactions between floral resources and bees (Hymenoptera : Megachilidae) in commercial alfalfa seed fields,Megachile rotundata; Medicago sativa; alfalfa seed; nectar; pollination ecology; flowering phenology,NESTING SUCCESS; POLLINATOR,"We monitored flower resources around 9 Megachile rotundata (F.) bee shelters in 7 commercial seed fields of alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. (Leguminosae) seed fields to understand better the interactions between floral resources and bee pollinators. A composite pattern of floral resource availability demonstrated an initial burst of bloom, followed by a linear decline in total flowers per raceme and an exponential decline in numbers of racemes with open flowers over the season. Open flowers per raceme declined exponentially at a more rapid rate than did total flowers per raceme, and standing crop of nectar sugar declined even more rapidly. Thus, floral resources available to bees declined to low levels within 3-4 wk of bee introduction. Pollinator activity was relatively constant within a week or 2 of release of bees into the fields. Numbers of open flowers and nectar availability declined more rapidly close to bee shelters than at a distance fi-om them. We interpret the rapid decline in floral resources partly as a result of steady pollination over time. The decline in floral resources may contribute to poor bee yields in alfalfa seed fields.",1999
Genetic variation in morphology and growth characters of Acacia koa in the Hawaiian Islands,ecology; Acacia koa; forestry; genetic variation; Hawaiian Islands; morphology; phyllodes; seeds,EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; LEGUMINOSAE; POLLINATION; PLANTS,"Substantial phenotypic variation in Acacia koa has been reported in the Hawaiian Islands. We grew 72 A. koa families from the islands of O'ahu, Kaua'i, and Hawai'i in two common gardens to determine whether phenotypic differences in phyllode morphology, extrafloral nectary morphology, and other characters have a genetic basis. Significant differences among islands and families were observed for phyllode width, curvature, and pubescence, as well as extrafloral nectary size and pigmentation, retention of juvenile leaves, and branch bark color. Seed shape also differed significantly among islands. Discriminant analysis revealed that families from the island of Hawai'i are distinct from O'ahu and Kaua'i families. The O'ahu and Kaua'i families, however, could not be reliably distinguished based on sapling morphology or growth characters.",1999

The design and operation of the mesocosm and preliminary results for food production of the IAB are described for both periods. The overall rate of crop production for the 0.22 ha area (soil depth of 1 m; soil and atmospheric volumes of approximately 2000 m(3) and 38000 m(3), respectively) sustained both crews. Overall production rates in Biosphere 2 exceeded those characteristic of fertile agricultural land in the most efficient agrarian communities, despite comparatively lower light levels, lack of insect pollinators and unusually dense insect pests. Crop yields were markedly higher for Mission II than for Mission I due, in part, to experience and improvements based on the first closure. The health of the Biospherians is briefly discussed in the context of a low-calorie (1800-2200 kcal day(-1) per person for Mission I and 2200-2400 kcal day(-1) for Mission II), nutrient-dense diet characteristic of the Biosphere 2 food paradigm. sigh productivity and biodiversity were due to many factors including high resolution climate control, hyper-intensive agricultural practices, selection and planting of food crops adapted to humid, tropical and sub-tropical conditions, nutrient recycling, intensive pest management, and the superambient levels of atmospheric CO2 (concentrations up to 4500 ppmv were reported during the 1991 to 1994 occupations). Radiation use efficiency (RUE) for wheat for both periods and a post-Mission II planting were comparable to RUEs observed in other experimental elevated CO2 settings such as Controlled Ecological Life Support-Systems (CELSS) and Free Air CO2 Enrichment studies (FACE) even though yields were comparatively lower due to low light levels. Integrated management of pests, soil conditions and agricultural practices were key factors in the sustainability of the IAB resulting in minimization of plant loss due to insect herbivory, nematode infestation and reduction in the quality of IAB soils. The use of soils rather than hydroponic systems for the IAB had significant consequences for CO2, N2O and O-2 concentrations in the Biosphere 2 atmosphere and rendered primary regeneration technologies ineffective over the periods of closure. The initial high organic carbon content of the IAB soils prescribed by the designers proved to be the largest single source of CO2 and the largest sink for O-2. The choice of a soil-based compared to a hydroponic-based agricultural system contributed to the accumulation of N2O to levels as high as 300 times current ambient levels (approximately 310 ppbv). The IAB of Biosphere 2 has the potential; with system improvement, to be a high-yielding, self-sustaining agricultural mesocosm suited for a variety of research endeavors. ",1999

Wind-pollinated progenies of 290 trees were compared in common gardens according to ten variables reflecting allometric, needle, and phenologic characteristics of 2-yr-old trees. The tests also included populations of similar taxa from the Rocky Mountains to the north and the Sierra Madre to the south. Principal component and canonical discriminant analyses demonstrated that the taxa segregated into three distinct groups, one of which contained two subgroups. These groupings collectively accounted for all of the many and confusing taxonomic descriptions that exist for the Ponderosae of the southwest United States and northern Mexico. The results suggested that intertaxa hybrids or hybrid derivatives may have been segregating within the propenies of only three of the parental trees. Hybridization, therefore, appears to be infrequent and inconsequential to the interrelationships among taxa and to contemporary genetic structures of taxa. Univariate analyses showed that the three distinct groups displayed different genetic structures despite similarities in their geographic distributions. While genetic variation within populations of all groups was abundant, a group labeled 'quinquefoliata"" displayed little variation among populations; one labeled ""engelmannii"" had abundant interpopulation variation that was largely randomly distributed across the landscape; and in a group containing the subgroups called ""scopulorum"" and ""taxon X,"" abundant interpopulation variability was arranged systematically along moderately steep dines. These disparate genetic structures showed no apparent effects of the isolated, disjunct, and peripheral conditions under which populations of these taxa exist.",1999
"Sexual reproductive ecology of Carex bigelowii, an arctic-alpine sedge",,CLONAL PLANTS; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; GROWTH; DIVERSITY; TUNDRA; CONSEQUENCES; POLLINATION; CYPERACEAE; PHENOLOGY,"Carex bigelowii is an arctic-alpine sedge that shows an extensive clonal growth, and in many years also has a high degree of flowering. To see which factors are most important in determining the sexual reproductive success, the effects of self- and cross-pollination, pollen donor distance, amount of pollen, temperature, and time of flowering were studied. The study was conducted at Latnjajaure Field Station, northern Sweden and Thingvellir National Park, Iceland during three field seasons. Experimentally increased air temperature raised the fruit set and the fruit weight, in two of the three seasons. Pollen donor distance did not influence either fruit set or fruit weight, and there was no difference in fruit weight between selfing and cross-pollination. An increased amount of pollen raised the fruit set, but did not affect fruit weight. The lime of flowering was also important; there was a negative relationship between flowering time and fruit set and fruit weight, i.e. late flowering ramets had a lower fruit set and fruit weight. The results suggest that Carex bigelowii is an outcrossed species where the reproductive success is mainly determined by the weather, and that there are differences between the two study sites.",1999
Family outcrossing rates and neighborhood floral density in natural populations of swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata): potential statistical artifacts,Asclepias incarnata; flower-density family outcrossing; Monte-Carlo simulation; self-compatibility,MATING SYSTEM PARAMETERS; EVOLUTION; ASTERACEAE; MARKERS; ECOLOGY; PLANTS; PINE,"To evaluate how environmental and genetic factors influence mating-system evolution, accurate estimates of outcrossing rates of individual plants (families) are required. Using isozyme markers, we observed wide variation in family outcrossing rates in three natural populations of Asclepias incarnata using three statistical methods: (1) a multilocus maximum-likelihood procedure (t(m)); (2) a multilocus method-of-moments procedure (t(a)); and (3) a direct comparison of progeny phenotypes against maternal phenotypes (t(d)). Neighborhood floral-display size was positively correlated with t(a) in one population, but showed no relationship with any of the other estimates of outcrossing for any population. Monte-Carlo simulations revealed that statistical variation associated with these estimation procedures can be large enough to explain all of the observed variation in outcrossing. We also found that significant, spurious correlations with neighborhood floral display could arise, on average, 7% of the time by chance alone. Our observations suggest that it is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of outcrossing in naturally pollinated plants using the estimation procedures currently available. Moreover, we caution that attempts to interpret observed variation in family outcrossing estimates by observing variation in ecological parameters could be misleading.",1999

It closely resembles G. permeabilis subsp. edulis in vegetative features and in flower form, but differs from it in flower colour and in the elongate perianth tube. These floral features are apparently adaptations to pollination by long-proboscid flies.",1999

A. bicolor females oviposit through the outside of the globular fig inflorescence; offspring feed on sterile tissue within galls induced on the inner wall of fig. Oviposition coincides with entry of the pollinators (Pegoscapus mexicanus; Hymenoptera: Agaonidae: Agaoninae) into the fig, and does not interfere with pollination. Pollinator presence is in fact crucial to A. bicolor success, because unpollinated, galled figs are aborted by the tree. However,A. bicolor may nevertheless reduce pollinator success: maturation of pollinator offspring appears to be negatively affected by the developing A. bicolor galls. Although the composition of the wasp community associated with the native Florida figs is relatively well-known, this is one of the first studies of the natural history of one of the non-pollinator species.",1999

Modeling and experiment analysis of electrostatic date pollination,pollination; electrostatic; artificial pollination; finite element; date; agriculture,,"Artificial pollination can influence economic profit in modem agriculture and competitive markets for quality fruits, vegetables and hybrid seeds, especially where climatic and ecological conditions are unfavorable. Technologies for electrostatic deposition of small particles were modified for flower pollination. The electric field in a system comprised of a charged cloud approaching a grounded flower was investigated with a 3-D finite element model. A simulation based on a finite element model was created and the pollen grain trajectories, which initiated from the cloud and ended an the flower were calculated. An experimental device for electrostatic pollination was developed and tested in the laboratory and then under field conditions. Both model and laboratory results showed increased pollen density on the stigma, as compared to the flower envelope. Field experiments on dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) showed that electrostatic pollination doubled the yield. The work demonstrated the advantages of electrostatic pollination and the possibilities for developing this technology.",1999
Impact of flower standing crop and pollinator movement on alfalfa seed yield,Medicago sativa; Megachile rotundata; pollination ecology; alfalfa; seed production,INBREEDING DEPRESSION; PLANT SIZE; GEITONOGAMY; CONSEQUENCES,"For agricultural crops that depend on pollination, the impact of flower abundance and pollinator movement on seed or fruit yield is of economic importance, and may have implications for crop and pollinator management. Using alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. (Leguminosae), I tested the hypothesis that seed set is lower when standing crop of open Rowers is high than when standing crop is low. This could occur if pollinators move more among flowers on the same plant, causing self-pollination, when flowers are abundant. In a greenhouse experiment I compared seed set for 3 simulated pollinator movement patterns between flowers on the same versus different plants, under the 2 standing crop regimes generated by varying the number of flowers hand-pollinated each day. Treatments maximized, minimized, and were intermediate in movement between flowers on different plants. Significantly more seeds were produced per pod when flower standing crop was low than when standing crop was high. I hypothesized that movement pattern would have a greater effect when standing crop was high rather than low. Despite a trend in the expected direction, this interaction was not significant. Field observations of within versus between plant movement of the pollinator, Megachile rotundata (F.) (Megachilidae), indicated that the bees visit more flowers per raceme when standing crop is high than when standing crop is low. In a series of hand pollinations among flowers on the same plant, seeds per pollination decreased between the Ist flowers pollinated and later flowers pollinated in succession. Alfalfa may yield less seed when flowers are abundant, suggesting that early introduction of bees into alfalfa seed fields is desirable to maintain a low flower standing crop.",1999

Temperatures of the nodding inflorescences were higher than temperatures of the surrounding air during the day, while the respective temperatures were comparable during the night. Also, compared to other parts of the plant, the nodding inflorescence provided favorable temperature conditions. An experiment showed that the radiation reflected from the substratum explained most of the variability in the inflorescence temperature. It is suggested that the nodding capitula have evolved to protect the flowers from snow and rain while at the same time ensuring sufficient temperatures for floral development.",1999

Nakai were investigated using allozymes as genetic markers. In Korea, S, borealis usually grows on hillsides under pine-oak understory. Many species of bamboos have the intermast period of ""mast seeding."" After spreading by extensive rhizomes for a specific period, nearly all adults in one area produce wind-pollinated flowers, set large quantities of seeds, and die. This study was undertaken to infer relationships between levels of genetic diversity and the reproductive biology of the species. Populations of S. borealis maintain high levels of genetic diversity: 51% of the loci examined were polymorphic and of mean genetic diversity (H-eP = 0.219). The mean number of multilocus genotypes per population was 18.4, and the mean genotypic diversity index (D-G) was 0.720. However, 31% of the total genetic Variation was found among populations (G(ST) = 0.310). Allele frequencies for all loci examined differed significantly among populations (p < 0.001). Average genetic identity for all pairs of populations was 0.833 (SD = 0.046). Indirect estimates of the number of migrants per generation (Nm) were 0.56 (calculated from G(ST)) and 0.20 (calculated from the mean frequency of ten private alleles). Several biological and ecological traits found in S. borealis (widespread geographical distribution, long-lived habit, clonal reproduction with relatively high genotypic diversity, wind-pollinated breeding system, death of adults bearing large quantities of seeds, probable low gene flow among populations, selection for heterozyous genotypes in some of the sampled populations, the patterns of recolonization, effects of genetic drift, and local selective forces) may have played roles in shaping the population genetic structure of the species.",1999

In terms of sex allocation strategies, the outbreeding species like P. lanceolata, P. lagopus invest more to the development of floral features and to mate functions.

Seeds obtained from self-pollinated flowers were significantly lighter then seeds obtained from open- and cross-pollinated flowers. Pollen and resource limitation, inbreeding depression, and allocation to sexual functions are discussed to explain seed set. The role of different floral Visitors (including bees, beetles, and ants) on reproductive success was examined through exclusion experiments and efficiency tests. Only one species of bee (Andrena assimilis, Andrenidae) from the 25 insect species that were recorded during two study seasons seemed to be responsible for successful pollination. Thus, although flower morphology is open and excludes few if any floral visitors, most of the visitors were not suitable pollinators.",1999

It is especially in insular ecosystems where it has been found that this type of interactions, particularly plant-animal interactions, can be very important for the maintenance of biodiversity. Islands, with relatively high values of biodiversity, are especially vulnerable to habitat modifications of any kind, and the loss of a species can cause a dramatic reduction -or even the extinction- of other species which depend on the former. In this paper I present some examples of islands where plant-animal mutualisms an presumably important for the plant community structure and for biodiversity in general. The current major threats to animal mutualists (pollinators and seed dispersers, in particular) are enumerated as well as the factors that need to be considered when predicting the extinction risk of a plant devoid of these mutualists. Finally, some documented cases of plant-animal mutualism disruption and its consequences are given. Conservation programs are certainly incomplete if they do not incorporate the study of both evolutionary and ecological mutualistic interactions among species.",1999

Relative autodeposition efficiency (i.e. mean seed:ovule ratio in caged, nonmanipulated Plants relative to mean seed:ovule ratio of control plants) was, however, low (0.29, suggesting that S. stellaris depends on insect visitation for maximum seed set. Seed set is not restricted by pollen availability, as indicated by a supplemental hand-pollination experiment. Plant size had a strong positive impact on ovule number, which in turn was positively correlated with seed number. Plant size also had a positive influence on seed weight. Seed weight was lowest for late-flowering plants, suggesting that shorter time for seed maturation and lower temperatures late in the season restrict seed weight. No correlations between flowering date and seed number were found, perhaps because the pollinators are relatively insensitive to temperature conditions and thus their activity does not change through the flowering season of S. stellaris.",1999

Taxa in this sec tion are distributed primarily in North America. Taxonomic problems in the group have been related to the lack of a comprehensive monographic treatment, incomplete descriptions, and a lack of an understanding of the patterns of variation in morphological characters across a wide geographic range. Based on evidence from a previous study using morphology, chromosome numbers, leaf anatomy and surface structure, achene and perigynium micromorphology, interbreeding relationships, ecology, and distributions, five taxa are recognized. The section, as treated here, consists of C. scirpoidea, with four subspecies (ssp. scirpoidea, ssp. convoluta, ssp. pseudoscirpoidea, and sap. stenochlaena), and C. curatorum. Two taxa, C. gigas and C. scabriuscula, have been excluded.",1999
Flowering and seed production of aspen in Scotland during a heavy seed year,,SALIX-VIMINALIS L,"In 1996, profuse flowering of aspen (Populus tremula L.) occurred throughout Scotland. In response, studies were initiated in Perthshire and Strathspey to investigate aspects of flowering, seed production and seed storage of aspen. The proportions of clones flowering were high, averaging 72 per cent in Strathspey and 77 per cent in Perthshire. The sex ratios were 1.8 male clones to 1 female clone in Strathspey and 1.3 male clones to 1 female clone in Perthshire, which are within the range of ratios recorded for aspen on the Continent. Easy and reliable methods of sexing aspen trees in the field during flowering are described. Seed production per catkin on four female clones in Tayside ranged from six to 60 seeds per catkin. Seed production was clearly correlated with the number of male clones in the vicinity of the female clones. A simple field technique for artificially pollinating female flowers is described. Artificial pollination resulted in seed production averaging between 159 and 460 seeds per catkin, i.e. approximately a 12-fold increase over natural pollination. The viability of seed from the two study areas was very high ranging from 94 to 98 per cent. The numbers of seed per kilogram varied between 7 million and 10 million viable seeds kg(-1). Seed stored at 6 per cent moisture content following rapid drying, and at -2 degrees C, retained levels of viability in excess of 95 per cent for at least one year. The results present excellent opportunities for increasing the supply of planting stock of aspen from Scottish seed and fundamentally change current perceptions of the ecological status of aspen in Scotland.",1999
Inflorescence height affects visitation behavior of bees - A case study of an aquatic plant community in Bolivia,Apoidea; aquatic plants; bees; Bolivia; flight strata; foraging; inflorescence height; inundated savanna; pollen loads; pollination,POLLINATION SYSTEMS; FLOWER CONSTANCY; SOLITARY BEES; BUMBLE BEES; COMPETITION; ECOLOGY,"We studied the bee fauna visiting a plant community of 10 species of flowering aquatic plants in an inundated savanna region in Bolivia. In total we observed 36 bee species in 17 genera at the flowers. Cluster analysis of the similarities among the plant species in terms of their visitor spectra showed a division into two groups: plants with inflorescence heights shorter than the grass height and plants with inflorescences projecting our of the surrounding vegetation. Larger bees of the genera Apis, Melipona, Bombus, and Xylocopa were observed only at hewers above the surrounding vegetation. Smaller, mainly solitary bees (e.g., Augochlorella, Ancyloscelis) visited flowers in the dense vegetation near the water surface. Analyses of the pollen loads revealed that most individuals were highly flower constant. When bees carried different pollen types, it was generally pollen from flowers within a single stratum. We discuss specialization, flower constancy, competition, and different foraging strategies as possible reasons for stratum fidelity.",1999

Pollen heteromorphism, defined as the production by flowers of several pollen morphs that differ by their aperture number, is frequent in modern angiosperms. In species of Viola, it has been demonstrated experimentally that more apertures lead to faster germination, but to shorter duration of viability. The number of apertures is under genetic control and many species of Viola are heteromorphic for aperture number. In this study, the occurrence of pollen heteromorphism was measured in 28 species of Viola that belong to the European flora. The genus Viola is divided into two groups, violets and pansies, which differ in corolla morphology. Pollen heteromorphism was detected in more than 85% of the pansies, but in only 40% of the violets. In contrast to violets, pollen heteromorphism in pansies was not due to variation in the ploidy level of the sporophyte. In pansies, mean aperture number decreased with the elevation at which the plants were collected. This suggests that pollinator-mediated selection due to variation in pollinator fauna along the altitudinal gradient, in conjunction with other physical characteristics of the environment (temperature, potential for pollen dehydration), may affect the proportions of the different pollen types. In violets, mean aperture number increased with elevation, due to polyploid species, which exhibit pollen heteromorphism, being more abundant at higher elevation than diploid species, which are not pollen-heteromorphic. Finally, significant differences in corolla size and spur length were observed among species of pansies and, to a lesser extent, among species of violets. These differences may in part be due to differences in the pollinating fauna among the different species.",1999

Achenes of Aster umbellatus var. umbellatus Mill. were separated into the ray or disc type with either the pappus remaining attached and intact, or removed. Differential allocation of biomass between ray and disc achenes or heavy and light achenes was not observed. Germination was relatively low (disc achenes with pappus removed, 16.7%; ray achenes with pappus removed, 22.9%; disc achenes with pappus intact, 7.3%; and ray achenes with pappus intact, 7.2%) for each. Although achene weight did not affect the likelihood of germination, germination was 2.5-3 times greater among disc and ray achenes, respectively, for which the pappus was removed as opposed to intact. These results do not conform with previous thoughts relative to the advantageous role of the pappus in germination. As such, I suggest that in this species of Aster the key role of the pappus is to facilitate dispersal as opposed to encourage germination. Furthermore, the production of morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable ray and disc achenes by A. umbellatus var. umbellatus would suggest that the significance of heterogamous capitula, specifically the production of ray florets, rests in their attractiveness of pollinators.",1999

S. apetala var. apetala is a shrub with asynchronic annual blooming, between the months of November and April (hot-rainy season). Each plant can exhibit more than one blooming episode in this period Their flowers are hemaphrodites, apetalous, heterantherous, odoriferous and the pollen represents the only reward offered to visitors. it is pollinized by species of Centris and Xylocopa, solitary and polyletic bees, which collect the pollen by means of vibratory movements. Other bees such as Apis mellifera, Pseudaugochloropsis graminea and Trigona spinipes are only pollen-thieves In this variety of Swartzia vibrating is an efficient method to collect pollen from the anthers despite non-poricidal dehiscence..

Two New Zealand micropterigid moths, Sabatinca (Palaeomicra) chalcophanes Meyr. and Sabatinca (s.str.) demissa Philp., were investigated for pheromone communication. Consistent negative results were demonstrated by (i) behavioural observations, (ii) exposure of blends containing active components of pheromones identified in caddis-flies and archaic moths, (iii) exposure of caged males and females in sticky traps, and (iv) detection of male and female antennal responses to both male and female extracts. Since no data indicated the presence of long-distance sex pheromones in Sabatinca, we concluded that these moths use visual clues to meet sexual partners. The secondary lack of pheromone communication in Micropterigidae suggests a high degree of ecological specialization in this plylogenetically most archaic moth family.",1999
"Effects of timber harvest on Cimicifuga elata, a rare plant of western forests",,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; SP RANUNCULACEAE; CLEAR-CUT; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; SIMPLEX; DEER; EDGE,"Cimicifuga elata (tall bugbane) is a Species of Concern with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and it is considered by Natural Heritage programs in Oregon and Washington to be endangered. Since the species occurs in forests, its conservation could conflict with other forest uses such as timber han est. It has been postulated that the species is dependent on old-growth coniferous forests. The objectives of this study were to compare populations of this species among sires with differing forest-management histories. In contrast to previous reports, we found that C. elata in uncut old-growth forest was smaller and less reproductive than in clearcuts, probably because plants responded well to additional light in cut-over areas. Plants in areas with other management histories. such as second growth and thinned stands (both >70 years old), were intermediate in size. Population structure also differed among management types. Herbivory by deer and elk was more frequent in clear cuts and edges than in unmanaged old-growth forests. No populations were known at the time of this study from second growth forests of moderate age (20-30 years), and it is possible that competing vegetation excludes C. elata from clearcuts after a few years. Management actions that retain hardwoods. thin stands, or create gaps may improve at least short-term conditions for this species.",1999

Population sizes are relatively small, ranging from a single plant to 63 plants, making this species susceptible to low genetic diversity. Suitable habitat for C, elata in the Chilliwack River valley appears to be mature, mixed Cedar-Hemlock-Maple stands, Douglas-fir-Maple stands, and some deciduous stands. However, most of the range of this species has been extensively converted through logging to young forest. Young stands that develop following harvest do not contain suitable habitat to sustain C. elata, therefore, current forest harvest practises threaten,this species. Cimicifuga elata has reproductive limitations that make colonization into new sites difficult. It is relatively much less attractive to pollinators than other flowering plants, and lacks any effective seed dispersal mechanism. Considering these biological limitations, the uncertainty of the effect of logging practices on this species, and the small population sizes, the future of C. elata is uncertain in the Chilliwack River valley.",1999

Pattern recognition combining de-noising and linear discriminant analysis within a real world application,,,"Computer aided systems based on image analysis have become popular in zoological systematics in the recent years. For insects in particular, the difficult taxonomy and the lack of experts greatly hampers studies on conservation and ecology. This problem was emphasized at the UN Conference of Environment, Rio 1992, leading to a directive to intensify efforts to develop automated identification systems for pollinating insects. We have developed a system for the automated identification of bee species which employs image analysis to classify bee forewings. Using the knowledge of a zoological expert to create learning sets of images together with labels indicating the species membership, we have formulated this problem in the framework of supervised learning. While the image analysis process is documented in [5], we describe in this paper a new model for classification that consists of a combination of Linear Discriminant Analysis with a de-noising technique based on a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis, called Kernel PCA. This model combines the property of visualization provided by Linear Discriminant Analysis with powerful feature extraction and leads to significantly improved classification performance.",1999

At the same time, biologists working mainly in the tropics and the species-rich temperate floras of the Southern hemisphere are documenting pollination systems that are remarkably specialized, often involving a single pollinator species. Current studies are aimed at understanding: (I)the ecological forces that have favoured either generalization or specialization in particular lineages and regions; (2) the implications for selection on floral traits and divergence of populations; and (3) the risk of collapse in plant-pollinator mutualisms of varying specificity.",2000

Empirical studies have also found that tolerance is a common response to consumers among plants. Currently recognized mechanisms underlying tolerance include several general sets of traits: allocation patterns; plant architecture; and various other traits that may respond to consumer damage, e.g., photosynthetic rate. Theoretical studies suggest that tolerance to consumer damage may be favored under a range of conditions, even when the risk and intensity of damage varies. However, most of these models assume that the evolution of tolerance is constrained by internal resource allocation trade-offs. While there is some empirical evidence for such trade-offs, it is also clear that external constraints such as pollinator abundance or nutrient availability may also limit the evolution of tolerance. Current research also suggests that a full understanding of plant adaptation to consumers can only be achieved by investigating the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance. While tolerance to consumer damage has just recently received significant attention in the ecological literature, our understanding of it is rapidly increasing as its profound ecological and evolutionary implications become better appreciated.",2000

To lest predictions concerning the occurrence of pollen limitation, species were classified categorically for six life-history traits (self-compatible vs. self-incompatible, autogamous vs. non-autogamous, specialized vs. unspecialized floral morphology, nectariferous vs, nectarless, monocarpic vs. polycarpic, herbaceous vs, woody) and two ecological conditions (presence in open vs. forested habitats and temperate vs. tropical biomes). Pollen limitation of species in contrasting categories was compared using non-parametric tests (TIPs analysis) and phylogenetically-independent contrasts (PICs). The results of TIPs and PICs analyses were generally congruent, although fewer significant contrasts were evident with PICs, probably because of low statistical power. Overall the results suggest that the influence of phylogenetic history on the intensity of pollen limitation was not particularly strong. Nonetheless, significant variation in the degree of pollen limitation was demonstrated among seven angiosperm families suggesting some phylogenetic component to the phenomenon. With both TIPs and PICs, pollen limitation was less intense in self-compatible and autogamous species. TIPs analysis demonstrated that herbaceous, nectariferous, and temperate species were less likely to be pollen-limited, but using PICs this could only be corroborated for those that were self-incompatible. None of the traits were singularly unambiguous predictors of pollen limitation, possibly reflecting the stochastic nature of pollinator service. ",2000

For example, secondary compounds commonly associated with herbivore defense have bran found in the nectar of many plant species, and many plants produce nectar that is toxic ol repellent to some floral visitors. Although secondary compounds in nectar and toxic nectar are geographically and phylogenetically widespread, their ecological significance is poorly understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the possible functions of toxic nectar, including encouraging specialist pollinators, deterring nectar robbers, preventing microbial degradation of nectar, and altering pollinator behavior. All of these hypotheses rest on the assumption that the benefits of toxic nectar must outweigh possible costs; however, to date no study has demonstrated that toxic nectar provides fitness benefits for any plant. Therefore, in addition to the:se adaptive hypotheses. we should also consider the hypothesis that toxic nectar provides no benefits or is tolerably detrimental to plants, and occurs due to previous selection pressures or pleiotropic constraints. For example, secondary compounds may be transported into nectar as a consequence of their presence in phloem. rather than due to direct selection for toxic nectar. Experimental approaches are necessary to understand the role of toxic nectar in plant-animal interactions.",2000
Patterns of annual seed production by northern hemisphere trees: A global perspective,masting; mast fruiting; resource tracking; seed production; spatial patterns,CENTRAL COASTAL CALIFORNIA; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; ACORN PRODUCTION; MAST; OAKS; POLLINATION; PLANTS; GROWTH,"We tested whether annual seed production (masting or mast fruiting) in Northern Hemisphere trees is an evolved strategy or a consequence of resource tracking by comparing masting patterns with those of annual rainfall and mean summer temperatures, two environmental variables likely to correlate with available resources. There were generally significant negative autocorrelations between the seed crop in year x and year x + 1 (year x + 2 in species of Quercus requiring 2 yr to mature acorns), as expected if resources are depleted in mast years in part by switching resources from growth to reproduction. Spatial autocorrelation in annual seed production generally declined with distance but was statistically significant over large geographic areas. Variability in annual seed production was relatively high and inversely correlated with latitude and generally not bimodally distributed. Patterns of spatial autocorrelation in annual rainfall and summer temperatures are generally similar to those exhibited by annual seed production, and relative variability in annual rainfall is also inversely correlated with latitude. However, these environmental variables exhibit distinctly different patterns of temporal autocorrelation, are much less variable, and are more normally distributed than annual seed production. Combined with the inverse relationship between growth and reproduction previously documented, these results support the hypothesis that variability in annual seed production is an evolved strategy and that annual seed production is more or less normally distributed rather than an all-or-none phenomenon.",2000

This paper is a review of the effects of nectar robbers on pollinators, pollination, and fitness of the plants they rob. Charles Darwin assumed that nectar robbers had a negative impact on the plants that they visit, but research done in the last 50 years indicates that they often have a beneficial or neutral effect. Several studies document that robbers frequently pollinate the plants that they visit. Robbers may also have an indirect effect on the behavior of the legitimate pollinators, and in some circumstances, the change in pollinator behavior could result in improved fitness through increased pollen how and outcrossing. The effects of nectar robbers are complex and depend, in part, on the identity of the robber, the identity of the legitimate pollinator, how much nectar the robbers remove, and the variety of floral resources available in the environment.",2000

Pollen supplementation increased fruit production by both species, indicating pollen limitation of fruit set. Together these observations explain why fruit production by these species was depressed in linear-strip populations relative to nearby reserves. This study confirms that habitat fragmentation can lead to decline in pollination and subsequent fruit set in wild plant populations. Disrupted pollination interactions of the kind documented in this study may offer a substantial challenge to the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes.",2000

Pollen odor, which originates from pollenkitt, comprises volatiles that belong to the same chemical classes found in flower scents, that are in species-specific mixtures, and that contrast with odors of other floral parts. Pollen can also take up volatiles from surrounding floral odors, but this adsorption is selective and varies among species. Pollen odors are more pronounced in insect- than bird- or wind-pollinated plants, suggesting that volatile emission evolved in part under selection to attract pollinators. Pollen-feeding insects can perceive pollen odor and use it to discriminate between different pollen types and host plants. Pollen odor influences bee foraging, including the location of pollen sources, discrimination of flowers with different amounts of pollen, and host-plant recognition by pollen-specialist species. In the few wind-pollinated plants studied, odors of male flowers or pollen are comparatively high in alpha-methyl alcohols and ketones; these volatiles may serve in pollen defense, with some known to repel insects. Pollen odor often includes chemicals with documented defense activity, which is probably aimed mainly at nonpollinator pollen-feeding insects and pathogens; an involvement in pollen allelopathy is also possible. Pollen volatiles comprise chemically diverse compounds that may play multiple roles, and their emission in pollen odor undoubtedly evolved under the principle, and often conflicting, selective pressures to both protect the male gametophyte and increase its dispersal by animals.",2000

Evidence for ecological causation of sexual dimorphism in a hummingbird,,EVOLUTION; TESTS,"Unambiguous examples of ecological causes of animal sexual dimorphism are rare. Here we present evidence for ecological causation of sexual dimorphism in the bill morphology of a hummingbird, the purple-throated carib. This hummingbird is the sole pollinator of two Heliconia species whose flowers correspond to the bills of either males or females. Each sex feeds most quickly at the flower species approximating its bill dimensions, which supports the hypothesis that floral specialization has driven the evolution of bill dimorphism. Further evidence for ecological causation of sexual dimorphism was provided by a geographic replacement of one Heliconia species by the other and the subsequent development of a floral dimorphism, with one floral morph matching the bills of males and the other of females.",2000

One relatively underexamined factor is the timing and intensity of attack by herbivores that feed on flowers or developing seeds. This study tests the hypothesis that herbivores that feed on developing seeds of wild sunflower, Helianthus annuus (Asteraceae), impose selection on flowering phenology. First, the study population was found to contain genetic variation for mean dare of flowering, so this trait could evolve if natural selection were operating. Next, the phenological pattern of abundance of five seed-feeding herbivores was documented. Damage by three herbivores, Haplorhynchites aeneus (Cucurlionidae), the head-clipping weevil, Homoeosoma electellum (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the sunflower moth, and Suleima helianthana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), the sunflower bud moth, was highest early in the flowering season, and declined as the season progressed. Damage by one herbivore, the seed fly Gymnocarena diffusa (Diptera: Tephrididae), was lowest early in the flowering season and increased as the season progressed. Finally, damage by two seed weevils, Smicronyx fulvus and S. sordidus (Curculionidae), whose damage was not distinguished, was constant through the flowering period. Third, damage by Haplorhynchites, Homoeosoma, and Suleima was found to be detrimental to plant fitness, suggesting that plants that flower when these herbivores are not abundant should have higher fitness. Finally, two phenotypic selection analyses were performed. The first included damage by Homoeosoma and Suleima, as well as flowering date, leaf area, and inflorescence diameter, as characters predicting plant fitness. Tn this analysis directional selection was found to act to decrease damage by the two herbivores, but did not act on flowering date. The second selection analysis was identical except that damage by the two herbivores was not included. In this analysis significant directional selection was found to favor later-flowering plants. Comparison of these two analyses suggests that all selection on flowering phenology is attributable to damage by Homoeosoma and Suleima: plants that flower later avoid damage by these two herbivores. While other influences on flowering phenology, such as pollination, mate availability, and seasonality, have been well documented, this study is one of few to demonstrate natural selection on flowering phenology that is a direct consequence of insect attack.",2000
Effects of habitat fragmentation on the reproductive ecology of four plant species in mallee woodland,,PREDISPERSAL SEED PREDATION; SUAVEOLENS SM WILLD; FOREST FRAGMENTATION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; ACACIA; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; POLLINATION; INSECTS; BEES,"Habitat fragmentation has the potential to affect plant reproduction by changing the community of pollinators and natural enemies, the neighborhood of potential mates, the availability of resources, and microclimate. I examined the effect of habitat fragmentation on reproduction of four species found in mallee woodlands of central New South Wales, Australia: Acacia brachybotrya, Senna artemisioides, Eremophila glabra, and Dianella revoluta. At six sites I surveyed plants in a reserve and in a nearby linear strip of vegetation. Two additional sites were established in a large reserve. Many effects were apparent at the extreme end of fragmentation, revealed by two-way analysis of covariance comparing reserves and linear strips at each site. The nature of the response differed among species. Flower production was greater in most linear strip fragments for S. artemisioides and E. glabra. Fruit set efficiency was significantly greater in linear strips for S. artemisioides and significantly lower for A. brachybotrya, E. glabra, and D. revoluta. Fruit predation was lower in most linear strips for E. glabra. For A. brachybotrya, fruit predation was significantly lower in linear strips. The net effect of these changes was a significant increase in whole-plant seed production for S. artemisioides, a significant decrease in whole-plant seed production for A. brachybotrya and in whole-plant fruit production for D. revoluta, and no consistent effect on whole-plant fruit production for E. glabra. In contrast, the only pattern apparent when the effect of fragment size was considered over a range from linear strips <40 m wide to a reserve >140,000 ha was a positive correlation between the fragment size and fruit-set efficiency of A. brachybotrya. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation can significantly alter important reproductive functions of species, by changing both the plant's physical environment and its interactions with animals.",2000
Pollen coupling of forest trees: Forming synchronized and periodic reproduction out of chaos,,TIME-SERIES; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; WIND POLLINATION; SEED PRODUCTION; OPTIMAL-GROWTH; MAST; DYNAMICS; PLANTS; DISPERSAL; PREDATION,"Many of the tree species in mature forests show masting; their reproductive activity has a large variance between years and is often synchronized between different individuals. In this paper, we analyse a globally coupled map model in which trees accumulate photosynthate every year, produce flowers when the energy reserve level exceeds a threshold, and set seeds and fruits at a rate limited by pollen availability. Without pollen limitation, the trees in the forest show independent chaotic fluctuation. Coupling of trees via pollen exchange results in reproduction being synchronized partially or completely over the forest. The whole forest shows diverse dynamical behaviors determined by the values of two essential parameters; the depletion coefficient k and the coupling strength beta. We find perfectly synchronized periodic reproduction, synchronized reproduction with a chaotic time series, clustering phenomena, and chaotic reproduction of trees without synchronization over individuals. There are many parameter windows in which synchronized reproduction of trees shows a stable periodic fluctuation. For perfectly synchronized forests, we can calculate all the Lyapunov exponents analytically. They show that synchronized reproduction of all the trees in the forest can only occur when trees flower at low (but positive) levels in a significant fraction of years, resulting in small fruit sets due to outcrossed pollen limitation. This is consistent with the observation that the distinction between mast years and non-mast years is often not clear cut. ",2000
Ecological mechanisms of reproductive isolation between diploid and tetraploid Chamerion angustifolium,fireweed; phenology; pollinator behaviour; polyploidy; reproductive isolation; triploids,DACTYLIS-GLOMERATA; CHLOROPLAST-DNA; HYBRID ZONES; CONTACT ZONE; ESTABLISHMENT; POLYPLOIDY; PLANTS; CYTOTYPE; ORIGINS; FLOW,"1 Theoretical models indicate that coexistence of diploid and polyploid individuals in sympatric populations is unlikely when mating is random among cytotypes and hybrids are inviable. However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51%, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26% of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15% were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49% expected if mating is random to about 2% of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6%, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4%). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour las influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.",2000
The long-proboscid fly pollination system in southern Africa,co-evolution; floral ecology; long-proboscid flies; pollination,SUBGENUS LAPEIROUSIA IRIDACEAE; NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION; FLORAL DIVERGENCE; PHYLOGENY; CAPE; ORCHIDACEAE; RADIATION; BIOLOGY; DIPTERA; FLOWERS,"Some 14 species of long-proboscid flies (Diptera) in two families, Nemestrinidae and Tabanidae, with elongated mouth parts are known to pollinate species in several plant families, most importantly Geraniaceae, Iridaceae, and Orchidaceae, across southern Africa. Long-proboscid fly pollination appears to comprise three discrete guilds of flies in the genera Prosoeca, Moegistorhynchus, and Stenobasipteron (Nemestrinidae) and Philoliche (Tabanidue). Flies in the three guilds are on the wing at different times of the year and pollinate different suites of plant species, sometimes with different floral characteristics. The three pollinator guilds operate for the most part in different parts of the subcontinent. Where there is geographical overlap, the periods of activity differ. Plants pollinated by long-proboscid flies have flowers with an elongate, cylindrical floral tube, mostly 35-60 cm long, a perianth of specific colors and marking, a floral reward of nectar, and lack floral fragrance. Pollen is not eaten by these flies, and anthers and pollen are often cryptically colored. Flowers are usually zygomorphic and bilabiate, and the petal or tepal lobes have characteristically shaped nectar guides. With few exceptions, the flowers offer ample nectar of sugar concentration mainly in the 20-30% range. Several orchids and one Pelargonium using long-proloscid flies for pollination offer no nectar, and pollination is accomplished through floral mimicry and deception. In long-proboscid fly pollination systems, plasement of pollen on the insect's body is highly specific, and there are at least six mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on an insect's body. When two or more long-proboscid-fly-pollinated plant species co-occur, each typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive success and that differential pollen deposition sites are important for plants pollinated by long-proboscid flies. Since these flies are the sole or main pollinators of at least 120 plant species and the inferred pollinators of at least 80 more species in southern Africa, they must be considered keystone species in the ecosystems where they occur.",2000

(Sapotaceae), a shade-tolerant canopy species in mature tropical rainforest in Queensland, Australia. We considered spatial scales ranging from 1 m(2) to 1 ha, and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 32 yr. Over the 32-yr study period there were six episodes of very high seedling recruitment (masts) at intervals ranging from 4 to 10 yr. Less than 2% of new recruits were found in the nine censuses in other years. We found no significant correlations between the numbers of seedlings per census and either seasonal or annual rainfall, number of dry months per year, or El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events but found two correlations with mean seasonal air temperatures in the years preceding flowering. There were long-term changes in abundance in both time and space. In 1965 there were 163 seedling-sized plants in two dense patches, whereas in 1996, there were 4000 in 15 patches. Once a new patch became established, seedlings recruited there in each succeeding mast episode. Adult trees varied in their production of seedlings. Only 25% of the trees in the sample analyzed participated in all mast years; others had few seedlings for up to 28 yr before beginning to produce many seedlings. Seedlings were shade tolerant. They grew extremely slowly in the shaded understory, mean height only doubling in 27 yr. They were also quite long-lived; 6% of seedlings recruited in 1969 were still alive 27 yr later. There was little effect of natural enemies on seeds or seedlings. We found weak positive and negative effects of density on seed germination, seedling mortality, and growth. Mortality rates of Chrysophyllum seedlings did not show any trends with time, nor with distance from conspecific adults. These results suggest that abundance of older stages is determined by recruitment as well as subsequent growth and mortality. Mortality rates of seedlings of species other than Chrysophyllum decreased with distance from adult Chrysophyllum trees. Under present conditions, the Chrysophyllum population may be increasing in relation to that of other species, perhaps leading to a reduction in tree diversity in this tropical rainforest.",2000
Repercussions of El Nino: drought causes extinction and the breakdown of mutualism in Borneo,biodiversity; drought; extinction; Ficus; fig wasp; keystone species,FIG-POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; RAIN-FOREST; FICUS; EVOLUTION; DISPERSAL; FREQUENCY; MALAYSIA; ECOLOGY; DIOECY; FUTURE,"Figs (Ficus spp.) and their species-specific pollinators, the fig wasps (Agaonidae), have coevolved one of the most intricate interactions found in nature, in which the fig wasps, in return for pollination services, raise their offspring in the fig inflorescence. Fig wasps, however, have very short adult lives and hence are dependent on the near-continuous production of inflorescences to maintain their populations. From January to March 1998 northern Borneo suffered a very severe drought linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation event of 1997-1998. This caused a substantial break in the production of inflorescences on dioecious figs and led to the local extinction of their pollinators at Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. Most pollinators had not recolonized six months after the drought and, given the high level of endemism and wide extent of the drought, some species may be totally extinct. Cascading effects on vertebrate seed dispersers, for which figs are often regarded as keystone resources, and the tree species dependent on their services are also likely. This has considerable implications for the maintenance of biodiversity under a scenario of climate change and greater climatic extremes.",2000

Each monoecious fig species also shelters a community of nonpollinating chalcids, composed of both gallmakers and parasitoids. The few previous studies that took these species into account aimed at determining their potential effect on the mutualism. To go further, we argue that the fig wasps represent an interesting model for studies of community ecology. Figs and fig wasps of different groups were studied in Cote d'Ivoire to quantify local ecological interactions. Regardless of their fig host or taxonomical position, we identified three ecological groups of nonpollinating fig wasps on the basis of their timing of oviposition in the fig and on their oviposition behavior Pollinating and nonpollinating fig wasps were shown to interact intimately and to have a significant effect on the host plant in at least some cases. Each species of the community seems to preferentially oviposit in a part of the female flowers, depending on their depth inside the fig. Convergence in fig exploitation thus exists in various chalcid lineages, and the community structure and organization are very similar between fig species. Concepts developed in parasitoid community ecology could now be tested on this promising model.",2000

In other words, pollination is abiotic and occurs via the fluid media, not an animal vector. Whereas some early concepts considered abiotic pollination to be largely a stochastic phenomenon, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that wind pollination (i.e. anemophily) and water pollination (i.e. hydrophily) have deterministic features and are sophisticated fluid dynamic solutions to the problem of pollen release, dispersal, and capture. An abiotic pollination syndrome is defined in which there is spatial or temporal separation of carpellate and staminate flowers, which are drab, a reduction in perianth parts, stigmas and anthers are exposed to the fluid, and typically unclumped pollen may be produced in large amounts. Separate pollination syndromes are defined for anemophilous (i.e. wind-pollinated), ephydrophilous (i.e. surface-pollinated). and hydrophilous (i.e. submarine-pollinated) plants. Distinctions are based on habitat and physical conditions for pollination. pollen size, shape, and ultrastructure, morphology and ultrastructure of stigmas, and outcrossing rates. For example, anemophilous pollen are spherical and small. ephydrophilous pollen are spherical or reniform and large, while hydrophilous pollen are filiform (i.e. filamentous) or functionally filiform. The pollination mechanisms and mechanics associated with these syndromes reveals a strong evolutionary relationship between plant morphology and fluid dynamics.",2000

Pollen thus acts not only as a means for transportation of male gametes, but also as a food reward for potential pollinators. Many findings provide compelling evidence that pollen acts, in addition, as a visual signal. The present contribution reviews several strategies that angiosperms have evolved to attract potential pollinators to the site of reward. We here consider evolutionary, ecological, sensory-physiological, and behavioural aspects of flower-pollinator interactions that are correlated with visual signals provided by pollen and pollen-producing organs, or imitations thereof.",2000

We studied the selection exerted by several species of herbivores and pollinators in three populations of Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae) in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over 4 yr by using path analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by the spatial variation in the relative importance of different interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in complex systems.",2000

Yet, the bilateral symmetry of orchids has allowed a greater degree of specialization in pollination systems and a much greater diversity in the morphology of pollinaria - units comprising the pollinia(um) together with accessory structures for attachment to the pollinator. Pollinaria differ in the degree of cohesion of pollen in the pollinium, which may be soft, sectile (comprised of sub-units known as massulae) or hard. A single hard pollinium may contain more than a million pollen grains, yet pollen:ovule ratios in orchids are several orders of magnitude lower than in plants with powdery pollen due to the lack of wastage during transport to the stigma. Attachment of pollinia to the pollinator is usually achieved by means of a viscidium that adheres most effectively to smooth surfaces, such as the eyes and mouthparts of insects and beaks of birds. The stalk connecting a pollinium to the viscidium may be comprised of a caudicle (sporogenous in origin) and/or a stipe (derived from vegetative tissue), or be lacking altogether. Caudicles and stipes may undergo a gradual bending movement 20 s to several hours after withdrawal from the flower, the main function of which appears to be to reduce the possibility of geitonogamous pollination. Other mechanisms that promote outcrossing and pollen export in orchids include pollen carryover (achieved by sectile or soft pollinia), temporary retention of the anther cap, protandry and self-incompatibility (rare among orchids). Pollinaria ensure that large pollen loads are deposited on the stigma, thus enabling the fertilization of the large numbers of ovules in the flowers of Orchidaceae. Pollinaria also ensure efficient removal of pollen from the anther, minimal pollen wastage during transit, and a high probability of deposition on conspecific stigmas.",2000

The cerrados are Neotropical savanna plant formations in Central Brazil. They represent the second most important vegetation province in Brazil and are nowadays the main agricultural frontier which has resulted in deforestation rates much higher than those occurring in lowland tropical forests. Despite the marked winter/dry - summer/wet seasonality, different species were encountered in flower throughout the year, although with a peak at the end of the dry season. Seven pollination guilds were identified, ranging from very small insects (body size less than 5 mm) to bats, but bee pollination was predominant, and overall pollination biology of the cerrado community was similar to that reported for evergreen neotropical forests. Most species were outbreeding in that self-pollinations yielded very few fruits, but heteromorphic and homomorphic self-incompatibility were rare and control of selfing was commonly exercised by ill-defined post-zygotic mechanisms. The results indicated that the reproductive biology of woody cerrado species is not markedly different from other tropical forest communities and suggested the adaptation to seasonal habitats did not always lead to simplification or changes in breeding features of the cerrado species.",2000
Reversal of mutualism as a mechanism for adaptive radiation in yucca moths,obligate mutualism; Prodoxidae; life-history evolution; macroevolution; indirect effects,FIG WASP; POLLINATION BEHAVIOR; WHIPPLEI AGAVACEAE; ACTIVE POLLINATION; SEED PREDATION; GENE TREES; EVOLUTION; OVIPOSITION; COOPERATION; PHYLOGENIES,"Species interactions are a major source of adaptive radiation. In mutualisms, such diversification can take the form of evolution of parasites that exploit the resources needed for maintenance of the mutualism. Mutualistic associations often have associated parasitic species, and in some cases, parasitic species have indeed evolved from the mutualists. For example, obligate mutualisms, such as those involving seed-eating pollinators, have on a few occasions given rise to nonmutualist species. These systems are relatively simple and provide models for identifying factors that facilitate the stable reversal of a mutualistic interaction. We used ecological data in a phylogenetic framework to analyze the origins of two nonmutualist cheater yucca moths. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of cheating may be preceded by a change in oviposition behavior. Two different modes of oviposition among math species cause density-dependent moth egg mortality through flower abscission in one case (locule-ovipositing species) but density-independent mortality in the other (superficially ovipositing species). A mtDNA-based phylogeny indicated that cheating and superficial oviposition have evolved twice each and that the cheater clades are sisters to the superficially ovipositing species clades. Consideration of the fitness consequences of two trait changes-loss of pollination and phenological delay in oviposition-in which cheaters have diverged from ancestral pollinators suggest that the shift to oviposition into fruit may have occurred first and that loss of pollination behavior was a secondary event. We suggest that secondary coexistence of two pollinator species of opposite oviposition modes may facilitate the shift to fruit oviposition and cheating and that this is applicable in the best documented of the cheater lucca moths. Superficially ovipositing species suffer dual sources of egg mortality when in coexistence with locule-ovipositing species. Shift to fruit oviposition under this circumstance can be facilitated by access to a seed resource not available to the copollinator, preadaptations in ovipositor morphology, and pollinator phenology late relative to the copollinator. Thus the adaptive radiation of nonmutualists from mutualists may have taken place in specific ecological contexts through few trait changes, and the reversal of mutualism would be a by-product of a shift to reliance on a previously inaccessible seed resource.",2000

Many of the genes that determine the enzymatic components of flavonoid biosynthesis are redundant, but, despite this complexity, it is possible to associate discrete floral phenotypes with individual genes. An important finding is that almost all of the mutations that determine phenotypic differences are the result of transposon insertions. Thus, the flower color diversity seized on by early human domesticators of this plant is a consequence of the rich variety of mobile elements that reside in the morning glory genome, We then consider a long history of research aimed at uncovering the ecological fate of these various flower phenotypes in the southeastern U.S. A large body of work has shown that insect pollinators discriminate against white phenotypes when white flowers are rare in populations. Because the plant is self-compatible, pollinator bias causes an increase in self-fertilization in white maternal plants, which should lead to an increase in the frequency of white genes, according to modifier gene theory. Studies of geographical distributions indicate other, as yet undiscovered, disadvantages associated with the white phenotype, The ultimate goal of connecting ecology to molecular genetics through the medium of phenotype is yet to be attained, but this approach may represent a model for analyzing the translation between these two levels of biological organization.",2000

Interpretations of the natural history of Ceanothus have served as a general model of evolution for woody perennials with simple entomophilous pollination systems, but these interpretations lacked explicit phylogenetic context. We used cladistic analysis of sequences of the chloroplast-encoded matK and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.85 coding region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) to reconstruct the phylogeny of Ceanothus. The nuclear and organellar phylogenies exhibited very low levels of both topological and character conference. Subgenera Ceanothus and Cerastes are monophyletic sister taxa in both phylogenies, but both data sets suffer from a lack of resolution below the level of subgenus. Lack of taxonomic congruence between the two data sets may be a result of introgression and/or lineage sorting. The ITS tree was accepted as the better estimate of a species phylogeny for Ceanothus, on the assumption that nuclear markers are less prone to introgression. Three of five polytypic species in the ITS data set were paraphyletic, and four of six polytypic species in the matK data set were paraphyletic. This study demonstrates the degree to which matched independent data sets can produce conflicting summaries of evolutionary history.",2000

In this study, we investigated the simultaneous effects of these three factors on the mating system of a self-compatible Brazilian shrub species: Helicteres brevispira St. Hil. Outcrossing rate is directly correlated with plant density. Changes in the number of flowers per plant affect outcrossing rate through their effect on the density of flowers. Variation in foraging behaviour of hummingbird pollinators is a consequence of the interaction between plant density and number of flowers per plant. Territorialist pollinators are common in high density areas but visit few flowers on each plant, thereby promoting outcrossing. In areas of low plant density, trapliners and rare territorialists visit several flowers per plant, thus increasing selfing. Our results indicate that outcrossing rate is a dynamic parameter, with the extent of variation depending on a number of ecological factors. In successional species such as those in the genus Helicteres, demographic changes may be accompanied by alterations in mating system parameters, with concomitant effects on the genetic structure of populations.",2000

To this end. I investigated various aspects of the pollination ecology of a population of the herb Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulgaris in northwest Spain over 5 yr. By observing floral visitors, I found that the most important pollinator species was the long-tongued bee Anthophora acervorum, which accounted for similar to 45% of recorded insect visits. However, just over 45% of visits were by the nectar-robbing bumble bees Bombus terrestris and B. jonellus. Although the incidence of robbing differed considerably over 5 yr of study, the frequency in every season was very high (66.4-76.5% of robbing) except for 1997 (0% robbing). Despite this high frequency of robbing, robbed flowers had a higher probability of setting fruit than nonrobbed flowers in all years of the study (mean: 82.0 vs. 51.0%; excluding 1997). This increased fruit set in robbed flowers is directly related to bumble bee behavior because the robbers' bodies came into contact with both the anthers and stigmas while robbing. Thus, the robbers effect pollination. These results suggest that the effect of nectar robbers on plant reproductive success is dependent both on the robbers' behavior and on flower/inflorescence structure. The importance of nectar-robbing bumble bees on the reproductive success of A. vulneraria and its yearly high frequency suggest that the relationship between robbers and this plant is part of a successful long-term mutualism.",2000

Moreover, because of the overlap in gene expression between the two phases of the life cycle, selection on microgametophytes may alter the resulting sporophytic generation. The extent to which pollen competition occurs in nature has been unclear, because tests of the predictions of the pollen competition hypothesis have used cultivars and/or artificial growth conditions and hand-pollination techniques. In this study we used a wild species, Circurbita foetidissima, in its natural habitat (southern New Mexico) to determine the amount and timing of the arrival of pollen onto stigmas, the relationship between pollen deposition and seed number, and the effects of the intensity of pollen competition on progeny vigor. We found that similar to 900 pollen grains are necessary for full seed set and that a single visit by a pollinator results in the deposition of 653.0 +/- 101.8 pollen grains. About 29% of the flowers receiving a single pollinator visit had 900 or more pollen grains on its stigma. Moreover, within 2 h of anthesis, >4000 pollen grains were deposited onto a typical stigma, indicating that multiple pollinator visits must have occurred. Fruits produced by multiple visits had greater seed numbers (206 vs. 147) than fruits produced by a single visit. Finally, the progeny produced by multiple pollinator visits were more vigorous than those produced by single visits with respect to five measures of vegetative growth (MANCOVA. Wilks' lambda = 0.96. F-6,F-370 = 2.54, P < 0.02. These data demonstrate that conditions for pollen competition exist in nature and support the prediction that pollen competition enhances offspring vigor.",2000
Are pollination syndromes useful predictors of floral visitors in Tasmania?,birds; colour; flowers; foraging profiles; insects; shape; visitor profiles,CENTRAL CHILE; COMMUNITY; BIOLOGY; POPULATIONS; MECHANISMS; MUTUALISM; ECOLOGY; AFRICAN; ANDES,"Diurnal visitors to the flowers of many native plant species were identified in a wide range of Tasmanian sclerophyllous vegetation between September 1996 and April 1997. These foraging profiles were analysed to determine whether they were characteristic of various floral morphologies in predictable ways. It was found that although visitor profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes, these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-, beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors, with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However, congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees. Of these, species that occurred at high altitude were mainly visited by flies, while others received very few potential pollen vectors.",2000
Variation of pollen limitation in the early flowering Mediterranean geophyte Narcissus assoanus (Amaryllidaceae),fruit and seed set; Narcissus assoanus; pollen limitation; reproductive ecology; seed : ovule ratios,POLLINATOR LIMITATION; POPULATION-SIZE; SEED SET; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; BREEDING SYSTEMS; WOODLAND HERBS; SUCCESS; VISITATION; ECOLOGY; PLANTS,"A recent literature review indicates that pollen limitation of female fertility is a common feature of flowering plants. Despite the ecological and evolutionary significance of pollen limitation, most studies have only examined fertility in a single population at one time. Here we investigate pollen limitation of fruit and seed set in five populations of Narcissus assoanus, a self-sterile, insect-pollinated geophyte, over 2-3 years in southern France. In common with many early spring flowering plants, pollinator visitation to N. assoanus is often infrequent. Supplemental hand-pollination of flowers with outcross pollen significantly increased overall fruit and seed set by 11% and 19%, respectively. Four of the five populations experienced some pollen limitation during the study. For a given year, there was significant variation in pollen limitation among populations. Two of the populations were pollen limited in one year but not in other years in which they were studied. Seed:ovule ratios for open- and hand-pollinated flowers averaged 0.29 and 0.33, respectively. While hand pollination significantly increased the seed:ovule ratio, the low value obtained indicates that the majority of ovules in flowers do not mature seeds despite hand pollination. The role of genetic and environmental factors governing low seed:ovule ratios in N. assoanus is discussed.",2000

Pollinator abundance and behavior on Aconitum lycoctonum (Ranunculaceae): an analysis of the quantity and quality components of pollination,,POPULATION-SIZE; MATING SYSTEM; PLANTS; BUMBLEBEES; VISITATION,"The yellow-flowered monkshood Aconitum lycoctonum has variable degrees of inbreeding among populations, despite being primarily bee-pollinated. Here we examined the pollination ecology of A. lycoctonum. We investigated pollinator community and frequency in four populations at two altitudes over two years. We found that flowers were more often visited at low elevation than at high elevation. However, because flowers lived longer at high elevation than at low elevation, and plants at high elevation had more flowers than at low elevation, the overall chance of a plant being visited may be greater at high elevation. Breeding system experiments showed that at least some populations of A. lycoctonum were self-compatible and also were not completely protandrous. Thus selfing, especially by geitonogamous pollen, will be common if pollinators often visit several Bowers within a plant, as we found to be true for the main pollinator (bumblebees) of A. lycoctonum. Although the stereotypical behavior of bees is to move upwards, 17% of the within-plant movements of the main pollinator (Bombus gerstaeckeri) were downwards, i.e. from a male-phased to a female-phased flower because the flowers open from the bottom to the top of the plant. Other pollinators of A. lycoctonum moved less often within plants. We conclude that in addition to differences in self-compatibility, differences in pollinator abundance and behavior could have led to variation in the realized mating system in different A. lycoctonum populations.",2000
Biotope patterns and abundance of meadow plant species in a Norwegian rural landscape,biotope pattern; fragmentation; hay meadows; landscape diversity; Norway; species diversity,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; RARE; FRAGMENTATION; POPULATION; HABITAT; EUROPE; FLOW,"The main purpose of this study was to describe the relative importance of hay meadows and other types of semi-natural grasslands for species diversity and to focus on the impact of the fragmentation of hay meadows on species diversity. The study area was the rural districts of Hjartdal and Seljord in the county of Telemark, southern Norway. Interrelationships between the landscape and vegetation were revealed by combining research at three hierarchical levels, i.e. the landscape, biotope and species levels. A descriptive and analytical technique based on CIR aerial photo interpretation was developed for the landscape mesoscale. The historical background of the landscape and former biotope patterns were described, since traditional and sustained management is an important parameter in the landscape ecological analysis. The vegetation of different grassland biotopes was classified and numerically analysed. The results of the aerial photo interpretation revealed a landscape with considerable complexity and high biodiversity both at landscape level and at biotope and species level, due to the many traditional hay meadows and pastures still left in this area. The results also showed that the remaining fragments of traditional hay meadows are of vital importance for biological diversity. They had the highest average number of species per subplot and furthermore contained species that did not occur in any other grassland biotopes. In addition, the largest populations of several grassland species were found in the traditionally managed hay meadows. Unfertilised pastures and verges along small roads were also species-rich but were not in this connection substitutes for the hay meadows, nor were the `modern' hay meadows or the verges along the main roads. The spatial distribution and configuration of the biotopes and the abundance of meadow plant species within the study area suggest that in order to maintain species diversity it may be important to preserve and manage all the remaining fragments of traditional hay meadows. The surrounding environment, the matrix, should also be managed appropriately.",2000

Following maturation and passage of the pollen tube or gamete nuclei, a series of equivalent gates close, some serving a prophylactic role (particularly in the Gramineae), others related to incompatibility reactions or conservation of water. The roles of the micro-ecology of the stigma and style, and of the gates. are discussed in the light of the success of angiosperms as a group, and analogies are made with the success of the mammals in the animal kingdom.

Predator satiation and extreme mast seeding in 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae),,NEW-ZEALAND; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; POLLINATION; TREE; POPULATIONS; DISPERSAL; DIPTERA; LONG,"Variation in annual flowering effort is described for 16 long datasets from 11 species of Chionochloa (Poaceae) in New Zealand. Ail populations exhibited extreme mast seeding. The most variable species was C. crassiuscula (coefficient of variation, CV = 3.02) over 26 years at Takahe Valley, Fiordland, which is the highest published CV we know of worldwide. The other populations also had high CVs (lowest CV = 1.42, mean CV = 1.84) which were higher than for other well-studied genera such as Picea, Pinus and Quercus. There were also frequent years of zero flowering (mean across all populations was 37.2% zero years; maximum 53% for C. rubra and C. crassiuscula over 19 years) whereas zero years are rare in other published masting datasets. Flowering was highly synchronous among species within a site (mean r = 0.886), and also (though significantly less so) among sites. Among sites, synchrony was not significantly higher within-species (mean r = 0.711) than between-species (r = 0.690). Warm summer temperatures led to heavy flowering the following summer. Flowering synchrony increased with increasing synchrony in local deseasonalised summer temperatures, and decreased with increasing distance between sites. Mast seeding has been shown in Chionochloa to reduce losses to specialist Bower or seed predators. Among-species synchrony may be adaptive if species share a common seed predator. Developing seeds of at least 10 Chionochloa species are attacked by larvae of an undescribed cecidomyiid. In Takahe Valley, where masting is most pronounced, cecidomyiids attacked all six Chionochloa species in all four years studied. Mean annual losses were almost constant (10.0 to 13.4%) while flowering effort varied 100-fold. The invariant losses are consistent with other evidence that the cecidomyiid may have extended diapause, which would make it harder to satiate by mast seeding. We hypothesise that one possible factor favouring such extremely high levels of mast seeding in Chionochloa is that its seed predator is very hard to satiate.",2000

There was a relatively regular fluctuation in bilberry production, with intervals between peaks of 2-5 years. The bilberry-production index was negatively correlated with the average bilberry production index of the preceding 3 years. Regularity in the bilberry production was commonly interrupted by unfavourable weather conditions. Depressed bilberry reproduction was associated with high temperatures during flower-bud formation in autumn, high temperatures in winters with thin snow cover, low temperatures during flowering in spring, and low or high amounts of precipitation during berry ripening in summer. It was concluded that, in Fennoscandia, climatic conditions may be responsible for the temporal and spatial synchrony in seed production in bilberry.",2000
Use of saguaro fruit by white-winged doves: isotopic evidence of a tight ecological association,saguaro; Carnegiea gigantea; stable isotope ratios; resource use; Zenaida asiatica mearnsii,STABLE ISOTOPES; CARBON ISOTOPES; FRACTIONATION; DIET; POLLINATION; TURNOVER; MAMMALS; BIOLOGY; TISSUES; OXYGEN,"We report the use of stable isotope and crop content analyses to quantify the use of saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) nectar and fruit by migratory desert white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica mearsnii). Saguaro resources had characteristically C-13-enriched CAM values (delta(13)C=-12.8+/-0.7 parts per thousand SD VPDB and -13.1+/-0.5 parts per thousand SD VPDB for nectar and fruit, respectively) relative to other food plants used by doves (delta(13)C(C3)=-24.9+/-3.3 parts per thousand SD VPDB). The water contained in saguaro nectar and fruit was deuterium enriched (delta D=19.6+/-2.0 parts per thousand SD VSMOW and 48.4+/-1.6 parts per thousand SD VSMOW for nectar and fruit, respectively) relative to other water sources (ranging from -41 to -19 parts per thousand VSMOW). During the fruiting season, there was a positive correlation between delta(13)C in dove liver tissues and percent of saguaro in crop contents. A two-point mixing model indicated that during the peak of saguaro fruit use, most of the carbon incorporated in dove tissues was from saguaro. Desert white-winged doves appear to be saguaro specialists. Averaged over the period when doves were resident, saguaro comprised about 60% of the total carbon incorporated into dove tissues. Tissue delta(13)C and delta D of body water showed a significant positive correlation, indicating that doves were using saguaro as a source of both nutrients and water. However, at the peak of saguaro utilization, the doves' body-water delta D was more positive (by about 20 parts per thousand) than saguaro fruit water. We hypothesize that this enrichment is due to fractionated evaporative water losses by doves. Using dove carbon isotope data and a two end-point mixing model we estimate that, on average, doves consume the equivalent of 128 saguaro fruits per season; each fruit contains on average 26.0+/-14.8 g SD of pulp (wet mass) of which 19.4 g is water. Stable isotopes have been used to produce qualitative re-constructions of animal diets. Our study shows that they can be used to provide quantitative estimates of the now of nutrients from resources into consumers as well.",2000
"Factors affecting the co-existence of the serpentine endemic Mimulus nudatus Curran and its presumed progenitor, Mimulus guttatus Fischer ex DC",interspecific pollen transfer; postzygotic reproductive isolation; ecological differentiation; Biological Species Concept,POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; SPECIES CONCEPT; FLORAL TRAITS; SEED SET; PLANTS; COMPETITION; POLLINATION; POLYPLOIDY; SPECIATION; POLLEN,"Population genetics theory suggests that two species which are reproductively isolated only by postzygotic barriers cannot co-exist in sympatry since the rarer population will become extinct Mimulus nudatus and Mimulus guttatus are two closely related species that are isolated by a postygotic barrier operating at the seed provisioning stage. On several sites on the serpentine soils of Lake and Napa counties, California, M. nudatus and M. guttatus live in sympatry and flowering times of the species overlap, so the species are sometimes flowering next to each other. We investigated whether there was any reduction in fertility of M. nudatus and ill. guttatus caused by interspecific crosses when growing in sympatry. The pollinators of M. nudatus and M. guttatus were identified. Small swear bees, Dialictus sp., preferentially visited the smaller flowered M. nudatus species and honey bees, Apis mellifera, preferred the larger flowered M. guttatus. In spire of most pollinator visits being intra-specific, individuals of both bee species made transitions between the Mimulus species. This will result in greater pollen transfer from M. guttatus to M. nudatus than vice versa because firstly, M. guttatus produces more pollen and secondly, the sweat bees were too small to touch the stigma of a M. guttatus flower. This asymmetry in gene flow was detected by greater reduction in viable seed produced by ill nudatus plants when surrounded by M. guttatus plants than vice versa. Only when M. nudatus was the maternal parent could any hybrids be detected in field produced seed. To enable M. nudatus and M. guttatus to co-exist in sympatry, the two species may thus need to be sufficiently ecologically different. Such ecological differentiation was attributed to the greater drought tolerance of M. nudatus. In addition, greenhouse experiments suggested that M. nudatus may have evolved greater tolerance to calcium deficient soils.",2000
The role of genes influencing the corolla in pollination of Antirrhinum majus,Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon); epidermal cell shape; intrafloral temperature; mutation; nectar; pigmentation; pollination,CELL-SHAPE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; BEES; PIGMENTATION; PATTERNS; FLOWERS; NECTAR; PETALS,"Studies of pollination ecology have been hindered by an absence of biochemical information about the basis of polymorphism. Using model plants and mutant lines described by molecular genetics may circumvent this difficulty. Mutation of genes controlling petal colour and petal epidermal cell shape in Antirrhinum majus was previously shown to influence fruit set. White flowers set less fruit than magenta flowers and mutants with flat petal epidermal cells set less fruit than flowers with conical cells. Here we analyse the causal pathway underlying this phenomenon through a study of floral characteristics and bee behaviour. Results indicate that bees recognized plants with magenta conical-celled flowers at a distance and did not approach white flowers or magenta flat-celled flowers so frequently. Petal cell shape interacted with colour in determining whether an approaching bee landed on a flower within a plot and whether a bee landing on a flower would probe it. The intrafloral temperature of flowers with conical petal cells was shown to increase with solar irradiance, unlike the intrafloral temperature of flowers with flat petal cells. The difference in fruit set may reflect pollinator discrimination between genotypes as a consequence of the effect of intrafloral temperature on nectar quality and quantity.",2000

Green. blue. ultraviolet-reflecting white and grey papers were reciprocally combined as targets or backgrounds, providing strong chromatic and/or achromatic cues. The behavioural performance of the honeybees was always symmetrical for both reciprocal target/background combinations of a colour pair, thus showing that target detection is independent of whether the colour is presented as a background or as a target in combination with the other colour. Bright targets against dim backgrounds and vice versa were detected more reliably than dim target/background combinations. This result favours the general assumption that the detectability of a coloured stimulus increases with increasing intensity.",2000
Patterns and ecological correlates of pollination modes among bromeliad communities of Andean forests in Bolivia,bats; bromeliads; diversity; hummingbirds; insects; montane forest; pollination,TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; CLOUD FOREST; HUMMINGBIRD; BIOLOGY; NECTAR; DISTRIBUTIONS; DIVERSITY; FLOWERS,"We studied the distribution of five pollination modes (ornithophily, chiropterophily, entomophily, mixed/unspecific, autogamy) among the bromeliad communities of 74 forest sites in the Bolivian Andes and adjacent lowlands. We recorded a total of 188 bromeliad species belonging to 16 genera, including 115 (61%) ornithophilous, 14 (7%) chiropterophilous, 45 (24%) entomophilous, 8 (4%) autogamous, and 6 (3%) species with mixed pollination mode. Ornithophily was the dominant pollination mode at high elevations and in wet regions, while entomophily dominated in arid regions. Chiropterophily was most common in wet lowland regions, autogamy in arid sites, and mixed pollination in the lowlands. Pollination modes were rather evenly distributed among life-forms and ecophysiological types, with a few exceptions: terrestrial forest bromeliads, mostly belonging to unarmed, soft-leaved taxa, had a prevalence of entomophily and few ornithophilous species; large, spiny terrestrial bromeliads of Puya and Bromelioideae showed a prevalence of ornithophily; and autogamy was restricted to the neotenous subgenus Diaphoranthema of Tillandsia. The restriction of unspecific pollination modes to the lowlands is hypothesized to be related to the abundance of pollinators, eliminating the need for specialized co-evolution, or to the overall rarity of bromeliads in this environment, precluding the development of specialized relationships. The low representation of entomophilous species in small dry forest regions compared to extensive areas is assumed to be due to the seasonal influx of hummingbirds and/or bats. Overall, the frequency of individual pollination modes was related to the availability of pollinators as determined by temperatures and humidity.",2000
"Nectar robbing, forager efficiency and seed set: Bumblebees foraging on the self incompatible plant Linaria vulgaris (Scrophulariaceae)",Bombus spp.; pollination; nectar rewards; corolla perforation; secondary robbers; foraging behaviour; common toadflax,POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; BEES; EVOLUTION; MUTUALISM; FLOWERS; IMPACT,"In southern England, Linaria vulgaris (common yellow toadflax) suffers from high rates of nectar robbery by bumblebees. In a wild population of L. vulgaris we found that 96 % of open flowers were robbed. Five species of bumblebee were observed foraging on these flowers, although short-tongued species (Bambus lapidarius, B. lucorum and B, terrestris) robbed nectar whilst longer-tongued ones behaved as legitimate pollinators (B. hortorum and B. pascuorum). Nectar rewards were highly variable; on average there was less nectar in robbed than in unrobbed flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. The proportion of flowers containing no nectar was significantly higher for robbed flowers compared with unrobbed flowers. Secondary robbers and legitimate pollinators had similar handling times on flowers and, assuming they select flowers at random to forage on, received approximately the same nectar profit per minute, largely because most flowers had been robbed. There was no significant difference in the number of seeds in pods of robbed flowers and in pods of flowers that were artificially protected against robbing. However, more of the robbed dowers set at least some seed than the unrobbed flowers, possibly as a consequence of the experimental manipulation. We suggest that nectar robbing has little effect on plant fecundity because legitimate foragers are present in the population, and that seed predation and seed abortion after fertilization may be more important factors in limiting seed production in this species.

Its host specificity has been debated since early this century, when cross-inoculation experiments indicated the existence of host-specific lineages. Recently, on the basis of spore ultrastructure, all presumed host races were lumped within M. violaceum. To measure gene flow among natural populations of anther smuts from different host species, we used microsatellite variation at 5 loci among samples from 8 Silene, 2 Saponaria, 2 Dianthus and 1 Gypsophila species. Most of the 326 M. violaceum samples investigated originated from the Swiss Alps and close surroundings. Microsatellite variation revealed almost perfect isolation among anther smut fungi from different host species. In addition, differentiation was supported by the nonrandom distribution of null alleles among samples from different host species and host genera. Null alleles were most abundant in anther smut samples from non-Silene hosts. The resolution of genetic differentiation among anther smuts from different host species was highest in those from Silene species. Genetic relationships among samples as indicated by Neighbour-Joining analysis based on genetic distances are discussed with respect to host phylogeny and host ecology. One sample was identified as Ustilago gausseni because it had verrucose instead of reticulate spores and was collected from Silene italica. Neighbour-Joining analysis revealed that this sample was similar to the M. violaceum samples from other Silene host species. Therefore, our data question spore morphology as a reliable character for anther smut systematics.",2000
Origins and ecological consequences of pollen specialization among desert bees,biogeography; foraging; insect-plant interactions; environmental variation,ANDREAS FAULT SYSTEM; DISTRIBUTIONS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; HYMENOPTERA; PHENOLOGY; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR,"An understanding of the evolutionary origins of insect foraging specialization is often hindered by a poor biogeographical and palaeoecological record. The historical biogeography (20 000 years before present to the present) of the desert-limited plant, creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), is remarkably complete. This history coupled with the distribution pattern of its bee fauna suggests pollen specialization For creosote bush pollen has evolved repeatedly among bees in the Lower Sonoran and Mojave deserts. In these highly xeric, floristically depauperate environments, species of specialist bees surpass generalist bees in diversity, biomass and abundance. The ability of specialist bees to facultatively remain in diapause through resource-poor years and to emerge synchronously with host plant bloom in resource-rich years probably explains their ecological dominance and persistence in these areas. Repeated origins of pollen specialization to one host plant where bloom occurs least predictably is a counter-example to prevailing theories that postulate such traits originate where the plant grows best and blooms most reliably Host-plant synchronization, a paucity of alternative floral hosts, or flowering attributes of creosote bush alone or in concert may account for the diversity of bee specialists that depend on this plant instead of nutritional factors or chemical coevolution between floral rewards and the pollinators they have evolved to attract.",2000

However, highly effective pollination by bumblebees in alpine populations can compensate for low visitation rates. In this study we hypothesized that, because of highly effective pollination by bumblebees, alpine populations of Campanula rotundifolia would not experience more frequent cycles of pollinator limitation than low-elevation populations and would therefore exhibit comparable levels of genetic variability and inbreeding to those found in foothill populations. Enzyme electrophoresis was used to assess genetic variability at nine putative loci in alpine and foothill populations of C. rotundifolia in Colorado. Genetic variability in C. rotundifolia was found to be comparable to that reported for other long-lived herbaceous perennials. Measures of genetic variability and fixation indices did not differ between high- and low-elevation populations and were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Nonsignificant F-ST values indicated no genetic differentiation among all populations.",2000

We examined variation in the size and number of open flowers in wild daffodils (Narcissus). Our analysis of published data on 45 taxa showed that flower number varied negatively with flower diameter among Narcissus species, which supports the widespread assumption that there is a trade-off between these traits. In contrast, field measurements indicated a positive relation between flower number and diameter within two populations of Narcissus dubius, and no relation was evident after we controlled for variation in bulb size. The discrepancy between inter- and intraspecific patterns may have occurred because variable resource levels obscure trade-offs when variation in flower size is low (e.g., within species). Size-related increases in floral tube length were half as great as corresponding increases in flower diameter, a result that is consistent with stronger stabilizing selection on tube length. Staggered flowering within N. dubius inflorescences limited the mean number of open flowers to <66% of total flower number, and slow expansion by later opening flowers resulted in significant differences in flower size throughout flowering. Although pollinators preferred large flowers, experimental reductions in flower diameter did not affect seed production. Our results illustrate how the relative importance of the factors influencing floral display can vary among levels of biological organization. Interspecific variation in flower size and number appeared to be constrained by allocation trade-offs, but intraspecific variation in both traits was more greatly influenced by plant resource status. Within plants, the size and number of open flowers reflected the relative age of individual flowers and floral longevity.",2000
"Wind pollination and insect pollination of two temperate willow species, Salix miyabeana and Salix sachalinensis",anemophily; entomophily; pollen limitation; seed production,ECOLOGY; FLOWER; SHIFTS; PLANTS,"Pollination systems of Salix miyabeana and Salix sachalinensis were studied at a riverside in northern Japan in order to measure the balance of wind pollination and insect pollination. In 1996, 19 clones of each species were selected, and seed-set success by a net-bagging (to exclude insect visitation) and an artificial pollination (to remove pollen limitation) were compared to by natural pollination. For S. miyabeana, the same experiment was repeated in two populations in 1997. Proportion of seed set through wind pollination dominated in both species in this study. Pollen limitation was common under natural conditions, and S. sachalinensis relied more on insect pollination for seed production than S. miyabeana. Meteorological factors such as precipitation and hours of sunshine during the flowering season influenced the potential reproductive activity of the willow between years. In the wet and cloudy spring of 1996, clones which obtained high seed set depended more on insect pollination for both species, whereas in the dry and sunny spring of 1997, such clones depended more on wind pollination for S. miyabeana. Because the efficiency of wind pollination seemed to be more sensitive to fluctuating weather conditions than insect pollination, insect pollination was considered to play an assurance role for seed production in these willows.",2000

Knowledge of the relative contribution of inbreeding depression in hermaphrodites and maternal sex effects to the female fertility advantage and the genetic basis of variation in female fertility advantage is central to our understanding of the evolution of gender specialization. In this study we examine the relative contribution of inbreeding and maternal sex to the female fertility advantage in gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris and quantify whether there is genetically based variation in female fertility advantage for plants from four populations. Following controlled self and outcross (sib, within population, and between-population) pollination, females had a more than twofold fertility advantage (based on the number of germinating seeds per fruit), regardless of the population of origin and the type of pollination. Inbreeding depression on viable seed production by hermaphrodites occurred in two populations, where inbreeding had been previously detected. Biparental inbreeding depression on viable seed production occurred in three of four populations for females, but in only one population for hermaphrodites. Whereas the maternal sex effect may consistently enhance female fertility advantage, inbreeding effects may be limited to particular population contexts where inbreeding may occur. A significant family X maternal sex interaction effect on viable seed production was observed, illustrating that the extent of female fertility advantage varies significantly among families. This result is due to greater variation in hermaphrodite (relative to female) seed fertility between families. Despite this genetic variation in female fertility advantage and the highly female biased sex ratios in populations of T. vulgaris, gynodioecy is a stable polymorphism, suggesting that strong genetic and/or ecological constraints influence the stability of this polymorphism.",2000

We also performed two manipulative experiments evaluating (a) the seed production efficiency of different crossing systems (selfing, cross-pollination. apomixis. and control), and (b) the effect of different pollinators (diurnal exposure to pollinators, nocturnal exposure, exclusion, and control) on the seeds produced. Flowering occurred from early May to late July and had a mean duration of 29 days in the individual rosettes. The flowers were protandrous; anthesis occurred in the afternoon of the third day after floral opening, and the pistils matured in the afternoon of the fifth day. The stigmas remained receptive from dusk to the following morning. Pollination was mostly allogamous. Nectar was produced principally during the night, from the first stages of floral aperture until the stigmas wilted and flowering ceased. The flowers were visited during the day by hymenoptera, butterflies, and hummingbirds and during the night by bats and moths. Only the nocturnal visitors, however, were successful pollinators. Agave macroacanthus is extremely dependent on nocturnal pollinators for its reproductive success.",2000

We also explored whether the above attributes are affected by the Mediterranean summer drought constraints. Our findings show that among all nectary parameters studied, nectary size and stomatal opening are the most important in (positively) shaping nectar secretion, nectary size being the most meaningful. Nectary structure is correlated to quantity of the nectar secreted, not its quality. Wide Rowers bear wide nectaries with large stomatal openings, whereas deep flowers are not related to any nectary size. Corolla size (both length and width) and nectary stomatal opening decrease with flowering time. This applies also to nectary size, nectar volume and sugar content of the perennials (9 species). Ail above cases of time dependence show that there is a constraint effect of Mediterranean climate on floral and nectary structure, reflected also as a decrease in nectar secretion. Nectary structure in Labiatae is largely shaped by both phylogenetic and climate constraints. On the other hand, although nectar is largely influenced by nectary structure, it is to a large extent ecologically biased, implying that, in addition to phylogeny, there are many other ecological parameters interfering in its secretion such as time within the season, life history, and light requirements.",2000

Plants from an autogamous population of Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae) exhibit complete pollen discounting relative to closely related out-crossers, as do morphologically intermediate Fl hybrids between the two populations. However, the low cumulative male fitness of hybrids probably results from reduced pollen number or competitive ability, rather than a nonlinear relationship with floral morphology. When surrounded by selfers, plants from the outcrosser population self-fertilize at nearly the same rate as selfers (>80%), but have much lower self male fitness due to reduced fruit set. Because outcross siring success is also extremely low (<8%) in this treatment, these mate-limited outcrossers are at male fitness disadvantage to both pseudocleistogamous selfers and nonlimited outcrossers. The relative male fitness of plants with different mating systems appears dependent on the ecological context, as well as on morphological trade-offs.",2000
Field testing for pollen allelopathy - A review,ecological experimental design; Hieracium pratense; interspecific pollen transfer; Phleum pratense; pollen allelopathy,PHLEUM-PRATENSE L; CORN POLLEN; SEED SET; IN-VITRO; POACEAE; POLLINATION; COMMUNITY; EXTRACT,"Field testing for pollen allelopathy comprises several approaches. In vitro tests must be done first to establish the existence of a pollen allelopathic effect. The number of pollen grains required to elicit an in vitro pollen allelopathic effect then is compared to observations of the number of pollen grains of pollen allelopathic species adhering to stigmas of heterospecifics. In animal-pollinated species, the amount of potential heterospecifics may first be assessed by observing pollinator behavior, but actual enumeration of grains is necessary. Tn all species, enumeration of the amount of heterospecific pollen transfer requires that stigmas be clipped before they senescence, carefully preserved in small test tubes, and assessed immediately thereafter with aid of a compound microscope. Stigmas may be examined for relative amounts of allelopathic and conspecific pollen to determine if the number of conspecific pollen tubes declines hyperbolically with increasing amounts of allelopathic pollen. Enumerating the number of heterospecific pollen grains on stigmas is used to support testing of the ecological impact of pollen allelopathy by direct manipulation. In habitats (e.g., old fields surrounded by forest tracts) where atmospheric conditions prevent export or import of other pollen from surrounding areas, the influorescences of a pollen allelopathic species can be clipped within a large area and the subsequent effect on seed set of target species can be assessed. The hypothesis that pollen allelopathy causes an ecological impact (reduced sexual reproductive success) is not rejected under two conditions. An absence of pollen from the allelopathic species must result in an increase in seed set in target species and the amount of pollen transferred from allelopathic species to heterospecifics is similar to that causing in vitro reductions in sexual reproduction in the targets. This experimental approach must be repeated over several sites and years in order to provide an unequivocal test for ecological effects of pollen allelopathy. This methodological approach has allowed me to demonstrate that pollen allelopathy is an important ecological interaction between Hieracium pratense and five sympatric Asteraceae species and between Phleum pratense and three sympatric Poaceae species.",2000

The pollination ecology of Ixia species can be divided into several distinct systems exploiting insects of four insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). Ixia atrandra, I. curta, I. lutea, I. maculata, I. metelerkampiae, and I. versicolor have salver-shaped, nectarless flowers, in blight colors contrasting with dark ""beetle marks"" and are pollinated exclusively by hopliine scarab beetles. Four Ixia species with narrowly tubular flowers, spreading tepals, and ample nectar are pollinated by long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris and Philoliche species). Three additional species with tubular Rowers, and modest nectar volumes, appear to be pollinated by the pieriid butterfly, Colias electo (Ixia orientalis), or by a combination of hopliine beetles and tabanid flies with short probosces (I. aurea, I. esterhuyseniae, I. tenuifolia). The remaining species are largely pollinated by anthophorine bees or Apis mellifera, hut bee pollination comprises three discrete systems. Species pollinated by Anthophora and Pachymelus species (I. capillaris, I. latifolia, I. odorata, I. rapunculoides, I. thomasiae) have cup-shaped flowers that secrete nectar. Salver-shaped flowers of I. flexuosa secrete no nectar, but are pollinated by pollen-collecting Apis mellifera. Buzz pollination by Amegilla fallax in I. scillaris is associated with vertical floral presentation, nectarless flowers, unusual in having a short, closed perianth tube, short, stubby filaments, and anthers dehiscing incompletely from the base. Outgroup comparison suggests that the ancestral pollination system in Ixia is the one in which flowers are cup-shaped, produce nectar. and are pollinated by large anthophorine bees. Exaggeration of the perianth into an elongate tube containing ample nectar, or the closure of the perianth tube and absence of nectar, or the development of basal anther dehiscense must he regarded as specialized adaptations related to their derived pollination strategies.",2000
Heterostyly in the Lamiaceae: The case of Salvia brandegeei,heterostyly; distyly; zygomorphic flowers; self-compatibility; protandry; geitonogamy; Lamiaceae; rare plant species,EVOLUTION; DICHOGAMY; BIOLOGY,"Heterostyly rarely occurs in families with strongly zygomorphic flowers. For this reason Darwin (1877) doubted whether heterostyly would occur in the Lamiaceae and recent reviews have not reported the floral polymorphism in this family. Here we describe distyly in a rare species of Salvia restricted to bluffs and seaward canyons on Santa Rosa Island (Santa Barbara Co., California) and northwestern Baja California (Mexico). Salvia brandegeei is morphologically distylous with populations composed of equal frequencies of long- and short-styled morphs differing reciprocally in stigma and anther position. Controlled hand pollinations demonstrated no significant differences in the seed set of self, intramorph or intermorph pollinations. Unlike most heterostylous species investigated, S. brandegeei does not possess diallelic incompatibility or ancillary polymorphisms of pollen and stigmas. We propose that the evolution of distyly in S. brandegeei may have been associated with an ecological shift to a new environment in which protandry failed to prevent increased levels of geitonogamy. Heterostyly was then selected because it increased the proficiency of cross-pollination. The origin of distyly in self-compatible S. brandegeei is consistent with Lloyd and Webb's theoretical model for the evolution of distyly.",2000

On one hand. such threads may function as pollen-connecting vectors in forming pollen dispersal units, as sporopollenin threads (viscin threads), e.g. in Onagraceae or sporopollenin-less threads in surprisingly many other angiosperm families. On the other hand, as is known from the Impatiens - ""pollen basket"", threads or ropes may be involved in pollen presentation. In addition, for the first time two new examples of ""pollen baskets"" in Boraginaceae and Scrophulariaceae are reported. In Echium the basket is formed by cellular elements from the modified septal regions, whereas in Esterhazya a similar effect is achieved in an analogous manner by trichomes of the epidermal layer of the thecal wall. There is obviously a different function of these seemingly very similar baskets: in Echium the feature acts preferably as a pollen presentation agent, whereas in Esterhazya the primary function is to prevent all the pollen from being dispersed too soon.",2000
Pollination ecology of Agave macroacantha (Agavaceae) in a Mexican tropical desert. II. The role of pollinators,Agave macroacantha; deserts; fruit set; Mexico; moths; nectar-feeding bats; pollination biology; pollinator effectiveness; rosette plants,NECTAR-FEEDING BATS,"We did a series of observational studies and manipulative experiments on the guild of nocturnal visitors of Agave macroacantha, including (1) a description of the hourly patterns of visits by moths and bats, (2) an evaluation of the relative contribution of bats and moths to flowering success, and (3) an evaluation of the pollination efficiency of the different bar species. Scapes exposed to moths but excluded to bats yielded similar to 50% fewer fruits than those exposed to both pollinator groups. Flowers exposed to the bat species Leptonycteris curasoae showed similar fruiting success to those exposed to Choeronycteris mexicana and to those exposed to the whole nocturnal visitor guild. However, the fruits originated from flowers pollinated by Lepronycteris curasoae yielded significantly more seed than those exposed to Choeronycteris mexicana or to the whole pollinator guild. It is concluded that Agave macroocantha is extremely dependent on nocturnal pollinators for its reproductive success and that bats are especially important for successful pollination. Some of these pollinators are migratory and have been reported to be steadily declining. A continuing decline in the populations of pollinators may impede the successful sexual reproduction of the plant host and may put the long-term survival of this agave species under risk.",2000
Artocarpus (Moraceae) - Gall midge pollination mutualism mediated by a male-flower parasitic fungus,Borneo; gall midge; Lambir; monoecy; Moraceae; Mucorales; pollination,REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY; USTILAGO-VIOLACEA; WIND-POLLINATION; MIMICRY; FIG; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; FOREST; SYSTEM,"A previously undescribed pollination system involving a monoecious tree species, Artocarpus integer (Moraceae), pollinator gall midges, and fungi is reported from a mixed dipterocarp forest in Sarawak, Borneo. The fungus Choanephora sp. (Choanephoraceae, Mucorales, Zygomycetes) infects male inflorescences of A. integer, and gall midges (Contarinia spp., Cecidomyiinae, Diptera) feed on the fungal mycelia and oviposit on the inflorescence. Their larvae also feed on the mycelia and pupate in the inflorescence. The gall midges are also attracted by female inflorescences lacking mycelia, probably due to a floral fragrance similar to that of male inflorescences. Because of the sticky pollen, dominance of Contarinia spp. in flower visitors, and pollen load observed on Contarinia spp. collected on both male and female inflorescences, Artocarpus integer is thought to be pollinated by the gall midges. Although several pathogenic fungi have been reported to have interactions with pollinators, this is the first report on a pollination mutualism in which a fungus plays an indispensable role. The pollination system described here suggests that we should be more aware of the roles fungi can play in pollinations.",2000

Inflorescences of P. melinonii were regularly visited by Cyclocephala colasi, a scarab beetle also found in inflorescences of P. solimoesense in the same area. The flowering cycle lasted two days and the inflorescence exhibited features typical for beetle pollination (e.g,, floral chamber, food rewards, flower heating). The flowering process is well synchronized with the night activity of Cyclocephala visitors. The spadix temperature was measured during the entire flowering cycle in the field in French Guiana and in greenhouse conditions at the Montreal Botanical Garden. Both measurements gave a similar temperature pattern with a two hour delay at the Botanical Garden. The spadix warmed up twice during the flowering period and its temperature was not significantly different from that of ambient air between the two peaks, These two temperature peaks are also well synchronized with the arrival and departure of the beetles on two consecutive nights.",2000
Why is mast seeding in Chionochloa rubra (Poaceae) most extreme where seed predation is lowest?,Chionochloa; Poaceae; mast seeding; seed predator satiation; effects of altitude; climate; site favourability; ecotypes,NEW-ZEALAND; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; WIND POLLINATION; DISPERSAL; PALLENS; GROWTH; RANGE; MACRA; TREES,"Mast seeding (highly variable population seed crops among years) is common in the New Zealand flora, and is especially evident in high elevation populations of Chionochloa (snow tussocks). However, mast seeding is less pronounced at low elevations in New Zealand plants, including C. rubra. Past studies of high elevation Chionochloa populations showed that the main benefit of mast seeding is the satiation of pre-dispersal insect seed predators. We therefore predicted that, to be able to set seed regularly, either C. rubra should suffer less predation than other Chionochloa species, or low elevation populations of C. rubra should experience lower seed predation than higher elevation populations. To test these predictions we surveyed seed predation in C. rubra and neighbouring C. pallens and C. flavescens at 22 New Zealand sites spanning over 1000 m in altitude. Total seed predation was not significantly lower in C. rubra (48%) than in C. pallens (22%) and C. flavescens (54%). Seed predation significantly increased with decreasing altitude, in direct contradiction to our prediction. This reveals a reproductive paradox: why do low elevation populations of C. rubra not show more pronounced mast seeding? We discuss three possible answers: (1) C. rubra has not formed altitudinal ecotypes with different critical temperatures for heavy floral induction; (2) the seed predators at low elevation are harder to satiate; or (3) low elevation populations suffer stronger disadvantages from masting through high intraspecific competition and/ or density dependent seedling mortality. We suggest that this paradox may also occur in many other masting plants with wide altitudinal ranges, that predator satiation will often break down at the lower altitudinal limit of the plant, and that seed predation may limit the lower elevational range of some masting plant species.",2000
Reproduction in an orchid can be resource-limited over its lifetime,Comparettia falcata; floral rewards; hummingbird pollination; nectar; orchid; pollen limitation; Puerto Rico; reproductive ecology; resource constraints,FRUIT PRODUCTION; NEOTROPICAL ORCHID; FLORAL NECTAR; LIMITATIONS; POLLINATOR; COST; FREQUENCY; DISPLAY; FLOWER,"Most orchids studied thus far show long-term resource adjustments to increases in fruit production within a flowering season, but none of these offers rewards to their potential pollinators. If nectar production is energetically expensive, then resources utilized to produce fruits and seeds may be even more limited in pollinator-rewarding orchids than in non-rewarding ones. Thus, resource adjustments may be more dramatic or entirely different in nectar producing plants. In this study we performed artificial hand-pollinations for two consecutive flowering seasons in the nectar producing orchid Comparettia falcata, and tested whether or not fruit set, seed set, and seed viability were limited by the quantity of pollinations or by resources. In addition, we compared mechanisms of short-term (fruit abortion within seasons) and long-term consequences (percent change in leaf length and change in flower number per plant between seasons, probability of shoot and inflorescence production, and mortality) between hand-pollinated and unmanipulated plants. The relationships among plant traits related to vegetative size and reproduction also were examined. Hand-pollinations showed some negative effects. Fruit set was higher in hand-pollinated plants in the first season bur was similar to the controls in the second. Seed set was significantly lower and abortions were higher than in unmanipulated plants. On the other hand, some of our measurements were unaffected by the hand-pollination treatment. Unexpectedly, there were no significant differences between groups in percent change in leaf length, change in flower number per plant between seasons, or the probability of shoot and inflorescence production. Although there was a strong correlation between leaf six and the number of flowers produced within a season, associations between leaf size and traits related to current or future reproduction were not consistent Like other epiphytic orchids, pollination limitation occurred within a single season in C. falcata, but increases in fruit production also resulted in reduced lifetime fitness as estimated by a compounded fitness index. Contrary to all other epiphytic orchids studied, long-term adjustments to increased fruit production in C. falcata through reduction in future growth or flower and inflorescence production were either minor or lacking. Our results suggest that the nature of plant strategies associated with resource constraints during sexual reproduction may be dependent on whether or not plants have evolved traits that are costly.",2000
Nectar sources used by birds in monsoonal north-western Australia: a regional survey,,KAKADU-NATIONAL-PARK; WET-DRY TROPICS; FORAGING ECOLOGY; SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; RAIN-FORESTS; POLLINATION; TERRITORY; WOODLAND; FLOWERS; MANGROVES,"We document the flora that provides nectar for birds in monsoonal north-western Australia, and examine the relationship between floral morphology and bird morphology in the region. Twenty-four regular nectarivores (21 honeyeaters, two lorikeets, one white-eye) and 29 opportunist species have been observed probing the flowers of 116 species of plants from 28 families. Amongst the nectar sources, the Myrtaceae is dominant in both the number of species and frequency of use, followed distantly by the Proteaceae and Loranthaceae. Variation between bird species in patterns of use of different floral structures primarily reflected the habitats occupied rather than shared or co-evolved morphology. Woodland birds made particular use of staminiferous cups, mangal specialists particular use of open sepaliferous and petaliferous flowers, and forest specialists and habitat generalists intermediate use of these flower types. Bird-flower relationships in monsoonal Australia may be generalised because of a combination of the dominance of mass-flowering myrtaceous trees, aridity during past glacials that may have eliminated specialists from the system, and perhaps also because many nectar sources are shared with bats.",2000
The realized effect of postpollination sexual selection in a natural plant population,pollen competition; mate choice; paternity; DNA fingerprinting; pollination; AFLP,RAPHANUS-SATIVUS; WILD RADISH; PATERNITY; SUCCESS; FITNESS,"The ultimate importance of postpollination sexual selection has remained elusive, largely because of the difficulty of assigning paternity in the field. Here I use a powerful new molecular marker (AFLP) for paternity analysis in a natural population of the outcrossing angiosperm Persoonia mollis (Proteaceae) to assess male reproductive success following equal pollination of 15 pollen donors on each of 6310 pistils. These results were contrasted with male reproductive success of these same plants following natural mating. Following equal pollination, there was a significant departure from equal siring success, indicating a potential for postpollination sexual selection. The most successful pollen donor sired more than twice the expected number of seeds, and this was largely consistent across recipient plants. However, siring success following natural mating was significantly different from siring success following artificial pollination and showed that the reproductive gains to be made from superior pollen performance did not translate into increased reproductive success following natural mating. As the ecological context for postpollination sexual selection is strong in P. mollis, I suggest that pollen competition may ultimately have only a weak effect on non-random male mating success under natural conditions because the realized opportunities for pollen competition within pistils are limited.",2000

DNA content and cytogenetical observations suggest it is an allotetraploid. Using two highly variable microsatellites (heterozygosity H = 0.615-0.616), we show that this species is an apomict with rare sexual reproduction events that account for similar to 0.5% of seeds pollinated in the wild. Hexaploid individuals were also produced, corroborating the observation of aberrant genotypes in the wild. The spatial extent of asexual clones in the field was low in comparison with the predominance of apomixis, thus indicating a low dispersal of seeds from their parent. Heterozygosity and departure from Hardy-Weinberg predictions were similar in the four populations, revealing a high apparent selfing rate (s = 0.599) among sexually produced seeds. This is an overestimate since we could not distinguish true selfing from reciprocal outcrosses between neighboring individuals from the same apomictic clone. Gene flow by pollen could be substantial, possibly explaining the absence of isolation by distance in the studied area.",2000
"Phylogenetic studies in Callitriche: implications for interpretation of ecological, karyological and pollination system evolution",Callitriche; phylogeny; hydrophily; evolution,ANGIOSPERMS; ALISMATIDAE,"Species of Callitriche (Callitrichaceae) exhibit considerable diversity in chromosome number (n = 3-20), ecology (submersed, amphibious, semiamphibious, terrestrial) and pollination systems (anemophily, hypohydrophily). Callitriche is the only genus of angiosperms in which both aerial pollination and hypohydrophily have been documented. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using morphologic and rbcL sequence characters for 20 taxa that represent the range of chromosome number, ecological and pollination system diversity in the genus. Parsimony analyses reveal that aneuploid reduction (n = 5 to 4) and polyploidy (n = 5 to 10) have evolved at least twice in the genus; whereas the obligately submersed growth habit and hypohydrophily have evolved once. Although internal geitonogamy (a unique self-fertilization system known only in Callitriche) occurs in at least seven species in the genus, the analyses reveal that it likely evolved only once.

For predispersal seed predators that do not themselves pollinate their host and whose larvae are sessile, females must be able to predict which flowers will ultimately be pollinated and set fruit, or be able to manipulate flowers in some way to ensure they set fruit. Otherwise, their offspring will perish. Here we describe the results of an experiment in which we tested if female Hylemya (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) are choosing oviposition sites wisely, or if they are manipulating flowers of their host, Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae), in some way to ensure fruit set. Previous work in this system established a positive correlation between oviposition and fruit set. By bagging females on flowers, we removed their ability to choose flowers on which to oviposit. We found that flowers females oviposited on, whether bagged (""no choice"") or unbagged (""female choice""), had a significantly higher probability of setting fruit than ""control"" flowers that we bagged but did not cage females on. In addition, we tested if Hylemya prefer particular architectural locations of flowers and if those locations correspond with higher than average fruit set. Although flowers at the distal end of the plant, and those most proximal to the main stem, were more likely to set fruit overall, Hylemya was no more likely to oviposit on those flowers than others on the plant. Tal;en together, our results suggest that Hylemya is somehow able to manipulate its host to ensure fruit set and thus the provisioning of their larvae.",2000

Nine provenances from 59-66%N and altitude 100-700 m within Norway, and nine open-pollinated families from a single stand (61%N, 270 m elevation) were used. Both provenances and families started bud set and frost hardening earlier in LL-HNT than in HL-LNT. Correlations between the same trait expressed in two regimes were high for both bud set and hardiness at the provenance level and slightly lower at the family level. The variation among family means in bud set and hardiness was large. The differences found between the family extremes were up to 75% of those found between provenance extremes. The relationship between bud set and frost hardiness was strong among the provenance means within both environments (r = 0.92) but weak for the families (r = 0.22-0.44). Causal factors influencing phenotypic variation within traits and covariation among traits may differ for provenances and families within stands. The strong relationships among traits that are found at the provenance level cannot be generalized to the levels of families or clones.",2000
Ecological significance and heritability of floral reproductive traits in Gentianella campestris (Gentianaceae),autofertility; dichogamy; Gentianella campestris; flower morphology; herkogamy; heritability; pollination; reproductive system,,"We investigated the occurrence of herkogamy and dichogamy in 43 populations of the grassland biennial Gentianella campestris in Sweden, and experimentally tested their significance for the reproductive system of the species. Furthermore, we performed a heritability test to evaluate the potential for selection on traits related to herkogamy. Dichogamy did not occur in the studied populations, and herkogamy was restricted to five populations. Two types of herkogamy were found, one with the stigma protruding above the anthers (hyper-stigmatic), and one with the stigma positioned below the anthers (hypo-stigmatic). In both types, the stamens elongated during anthesis. In the hyper-stigmatic plants, the anthers reached and pollinated the stigma after c. 3-4 days. This did not occur in hypo-stigmatic plants. Pollination experiments showed that the plants were self-compatible and that elongation of stamens provided a mechanism for reproductive assurance in hyper-stigmatic plants. The type of herkogamy did not differ between flowers of the same developmental stage within a plant. In two of the five herkogamous populations, the herkogamy differed between plants, but there was a normal distribution of the anther-stigma separation. Herkogamy was not related to population size. A comparison of the anther-stigma separation of self-pollinated mother plants and their offspring showed that herkogamy was a highly heritable trait (average h(2) = 0.85), that clearly has the potential to respond to selection.",2000
"Benefits and constraints on plant defense against herbivores: Spines influence the legitimate and illegitimate flower visitors of yellow star thistle, Centaurea solstitialis L-(asteraceae)",,NECTAR; RESISTANCE; BIOLOGY,"The evolutionary ecology of plant defenses against herbivores is generally understood ill a cost-benefit framework. We studied the ecological consequences of the spines of Ccn taurea solstitialis L. (yellow star thistle) which are typically thought of as defenses against mammalian herbivores. By experimentally removing spines, which consist of dead tissue, we show that ""nectar robbing"" lepidopteran all visitors are deterred by naturally occurring spines (a benefit). Unlike the lepidoptera, legitimate pollinators (bees and flies) were not more likely to visit spineless flower heads, although bees and flies did spend 20% more time per visit on spineless flower heads. One potential cost of having spines is the lower time per visit of the bees. The net result of spine removal from flower heads was a 22% reduction in the percentage of Riled seeds of spineless flower heads compared to, spined controls. Thus, spines of yellow star thistle mall not only deter mammalian herbivory, but also deter lepidoptera which are illegitimate flower visitors. Although the spines may be energetically costly (not measured in this experiment), or costly because of other ecological trade-offs, it appears that these costs are outweighed by the benefits of spines as a plant defense.",2000
Reproductive ecology and breeding system of Lomatia silaifolia (Proteaceae) following a fire,,GREVILLEA-BARKLYANA PROTEACEAE; BANKSIA-SPINULOSA PROTEACEAE; SELECTIVE FRUIT ABORTION; R-BR PROTEACEAE; SEED SET; AUSTRALIAN PROTEACEAE; FLOWERING PATTERNS; POLLINATION; POLLEN; REQUIREMENTS,"Lomatia silaifolia (Smith) R. Br. (Proteaceae) is a common shrub in southeastern Australian bushland that generally flowers only once after each fire. However, little is known of the details of this post-fire flowering. Lomatia silaifolia has flowers well-spaced along its conflorescence axis, unlike many other Proteaceae species, thus allowing close examination of the influence of flower position, mate choice and flowering sequence on fruit production. We examined breeding system, flowering phenology and spatial patterns of fruit set in the species, after a fire in September 1992 at Bulli Tops, New South Wales. Flowering occurred in December-January, but only in the first and second summers after the fire. The species is partially self-compatible: only 25% of self-pollinated conflorescences initiated fruits compared with 100% of cross-pollinated conflorescences. Fewer flowers initiated fruits after hand self-pollination (3.0%) than after cross-pollination (35.4%). Self-pollinated flowers produced fewer viable seeds (22.2% viable) than cross-pollinated flowers (62.9% viable). Pollen tubes were found in 72% of the self-pollinated flowers examined, suggesting that there is no early stylar self-incompatibility in the species. There was a high level of herbivory on flowering and fruiting branches, with 69% of unbagged branches completely destroyed. This may significantly affect recruitment in the species, given the limited opportunities for reproduction in the post-fire environment. In this study, fruits were evenly distributed along the conflorescence axis unlike some other species in the Proteaceae with more compressed, spike-like flowering structures where fruits are typically concentrated in some parts of the conflorescence axis (e.g. Telopea and some Banksia spp.). No bird visitors to flowers were observed, but a variety of insect visitors were identified.",2000
Pollination failure in mediterranean Ruscus aculeatus L.,dioecy; reproductive ecology; winter flowering,SEX-RATIOS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; REPRODUCTION; BIOLOGY; REGION; FLOWER; PLANTS; SHRUB,"The reproductive biology of Ruscus aculeatus L, was studied at a mediterranean site during 1996-1999. Field observations showed that reproductive success was very low, because only 3% of the marked flowers developed fruits in 1996 and none in 1997 and 1998. Several experiments were performed to investigate the reasons for reproductive failure in this species. Pollen viability was on average 85%, showing that reproductive failure is not due to poor pollen quality. Two hand-pollination experiments showed that all flowers are potentially able to develop fruits throughout the flowering period, suggesting that no aberration occurs in sporogenesis, fertilization or post-zygote processes in R. aculeatus and that low reproductive success in the field occurs because of lack of pollination. This hypothesis was tested by looking for pollen on the stigmatic surface of randomly sampled flowers, but without success. Moreover, the bodies of insects trapped in the proximity of the female plants were carefully checked for pollen but none was found. The number of pollen grains produced per flower is lower than that reported for wind-pollinated species. Nevertheless, iue showed with empirical probes that the possibility of wind pollination cannot be ruled out. The breeding system and reproductive characteristics of R. aculeatus seem to match the traits of the sclerophyllous taxa remnants of the tropical Tertiary flora. Moreover, the climatic fluctuation of the Quaternary and the establishment of the mediterranean climate might have changed the conditions of a good pollination process. At present, the low sexual reproduction of R. aculeatus is due to the lack of pollen transport. Within a population of R. aculeatus, genetic variability is revealed by seeds from the few developed fruits which have been shown to be viable.

Six species showed self-incompatibility (SI), with heteromorphic SI in Erythroxylum microphyllum, and probable homomorphic gametophytic SI (stylar inhibition of self-pollen tubes) in Aechmea distichantha, Bromelia serra, Cleistocactus baumannii, Dyckia ferox and Grabowskia duplicata. Opuntia retrorsa was self-compatible. A notable feature of inter-morph cross-compatibility in E. microphyllum was differential fruiting success using pollen from different stamen whorls of the long-style morph. The high incidence of self-incompatibility in the understorey component of this Chaco woodland is similar to that found in some South American montane forests, and is in contrast to the widespread self-compatibility reported for this stratum in some neotropical forests. It is proposed that these breeding system differences are probably linked to the different taxonomic families represented in the understorey strata of these communities and are not a consequence of adaptations to pollination biology or other ecological factors.",2000

It is one of the central concerns of plant reproductive ecology and evolutionary biology. In this paper, we attempt to introduce the main advances and some new interests in pollination biology and make a brief review of the research work that has been done in China in recent years. We also give some insights into the study that we intend to carry out in this field in the future.",2000
Pollination ecology of Helicteres isora Linn. (Sterculiaceae),,HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; FLOWERS; BIRDS,"The flowers of Helicteres isora are large, bisexual and zygomorphic with robust corolla. The elongated staminal column is adnate to the gynophore and the ten anthers are grouped at the tip of this column. The ovary with a short style ending in a simple stigma projects beyond the anthers and stays in an erect position. The flowers open daily at 0300-0330 h and are visited by birds and insects during daytime. The flowers characteristically change their colour, being bluish-grey on day one (d(1)), changing to light red on day two (d(2)) and dark red on day three (d(3)). Birds collect nectar more frequently from d(2) and d(3) flowers. Bees collect nectar and pollen mostly from d(1) flowers. The flowers are not apomictic, but compatible for auto-, geitono- and xenogamy. The bees Ceratina and Trigona mediate autogamy and geitonogamy by remaining mostly on the same flower while Pseudapis and Amegilla promote xenogamy by their frequent inter-tree movement. The birds quaker babbler Alcippe poioicephala and Indian myna Acridotheres tristis largely promote xenogamy because stigma receptivity continues up to the second day of flower life. Since the two bird species implicated in pollination are not entirely nectarivorous, total dependence on them for pollination may not be an ideal strategy, and receiving pollen-collecting bees may help in the reproduction of H. isora. Floral damage caused by the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer and by the blister beetle and the insect larvae is detrimental to H. isora reproduction. Natural fruit production is very low which may be due to the in-adequancy of pollinators.",2000
Breeding systems in two species of the genus Helleborus (Ranunculaceae),breeding system; Helleborus bocconei; Helleborus foetidus; reproductive ecology; seed production; sympatric species,,"The results of various types of manual and free pollination are reported in Helleborus bocconei and Helleborus foetidus, two sympatric species of the understorey of submediterranean woods that flower in January-March and are pollinated by bumble-bees of the genus Bombus. species were found to be partially self-compatible even if at different rates; geitonogamy seems to be more frequent in H. foetidus and spontaneous self-pollination does not usually occur for morphological reasons, and the species are not apomictic. Efficiency in seed production alter free pollination was very high indicating that in spite of harsh climatic condition, there were no limitations imposed by pollen or pollinators.",2000
Insect attracting structures on Erodium petals (Geraniaceae),Erodium; false nectaries; nectar collection; flower symmetry; glistening hairs; nectar mimicking structures,GENUS PELARGONIUM GERANIACEAE; ORGANOPHYLETIC PERSPECTIVES; REMARKABLE NECTARIES; SOUTHERN AFRICA; POLLINATION; ECOLOGY,"Two types of structures previously unrecorded in Erodium petals are investigated. Spherical hairs filled with liquid resembling nectar droplets are exclusive to an ibero-mauritanic group of species included in Erodium subsect. Romana. Broad flat hairs which reflect light, shining as do nectar droplets, are restricted to most of the species included in Erodium sect. Malacoidea. Long, simple hairs in petals and sepals are involved in collection of nectar droplets. Some of them are arranged at the margin of the petal claw, just over the nectaries. Others are on the internal surface of sepals or on the upper surface of petals, serving apparently the same function. Their shape is aciculate or flattened. The nectar collected among the hairs forms shining spherical droplets, perceptible to insects. The glistening flat hairs and spheres shine in a similar way, probably mimicking nectar and attracting insects. Species with these special nectarlike structures produce nectar in quantities that can be observed by the naked eye, suggesting that these structures increase the attraction efficiency of flowers. Some taxonomic and biogeographic consequences are also discussed.",2000

Plants sampled from a natural hybrid swarm were intermediate between the parental species with respect to nectar volume (5.85 +/- 0.14 mu l) and sugar output (1.76 +/- 0.04 mg), but they produced nectar with significantly lower sugar concentration than both parental species (24.3 +/- 0.2%). In Iris. the bird-pollinated T. fulva produced significantly smaller volumes of significantly less concentrated nectar than did the bee-pollinated I. brevicaulis (20.4 +/- 2.5 mu l vs. 56.6 +/- 6.0 mu l, and 18.3 +/- 0.6% vs. 23.6 +/- 0.3%). The net result was significantly lower sugar output for I. fulva as compared to I. brevicaulis (4.3 =/- 0.6 mg vs. 14.7 +/- 1.7 mg). Regardless of which parental species served as the maternal parent, experimentally generated F-1 interspecific hybrids were almost perfectly intermediate between their parental species with respect to nectar volume (36.6 +/- 4.2 mu l and 36.2 +/- 2.1 mu l) and sugar output (9.8 +/- 0.7 mg and 9.8 +/- 1.4 mg), but their mean concentration was more similar to that of I. brevicaulis (23.3 +/- 0.3% and 24.0 +/- 0.4%). It is unclear whether or not pollinator-mediated selection has shaped and/or maintained the large differences in nectar characteristics between these species.",2000
Trimorphic incompatibility in Eichhornia azurea (Pontederiaceae),tristyly; trimorphic incompatibility; pollen trimorphism; partial incompatibility; clonal aquatic plant,POLLEN-PISTIL INTERACTIONS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; PANICULATA PONTEDERIACEAE; SAGITTATA PONTEDERIACEAE; CORDATA PONTEDERIACEAE; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; TUBE GROWTH; EVOLUTION,"Eichhornia azurea (Pontederiaceae) is a mat-forming, clonal aquatic that inhabits lakes, marshes and river systems in many pal-ts of the Neotropics. The species is tristylous with long-, mid-, and short-styled morphs commonly represented in natural populations. To investigate whether E. azurea possesses a trimorphic incompatibility system typical of tristylous species, we conducted a controlled pollination experiment on 15 clones representing the three style morphs from a natural population near Rosario, Argentina. Comparisons of fruit and seed set following self-, illegitimate, and legitimate pollinations clearly demonstrated the presence of trimorphic incompatibility in E. azurea. Self- and illegitimate pollinations produced significantly less fruit and seed than legitimate pollinations in all three style morphs. Pollen from the two anther levels within a flower exhibited contrasting compatibility relations in self-pollinations, In common with several other tristylous species in Pontederiaceae, the expression of self-incompatibility was weakest in the mid-styled morph and strongest in the short-styled morph, We discuss the ecological and evolutionary significance of the partial expression of trimorphic incompatibility in E, azurea.",2000

Five natural populations of T. cuspidata in Korea were investigated using starch-gel electrophoresis in an attempt to determine the extent and distribution of genetic variation. The level of genetic diversity (A = 1.7, P-95 = 45.7%, P-99 = 60%, H-o = 0.172, and H-e = 0.168) and the degree of genetic differentiation (G(ST) = 0.067) were comparable to those of other conifers with similar life-histories and ecological traits. Five natural Japanese yew populations seemed to be in equilibrium with the expectations of HARDY-WEINBERG. Isolation by distance was detected. NEI's genetic distance, D, was positively correlated with geographic distance (r = 0.794, p = 0.006). Nm, the number of migrants per generation, was 3.48 and 2.87, depending on estimation procedure, and is similar to values in wind-pollinated conifers. Individual trees widely scattered around natural populations appeared to be critical to the maintenance of genetic variation in Japanese yew. Implications for the conservation of genetic diversity of T. cuspidata are discussed.",2000
Bumblebee pollination of understorey shrub species in a tropical montane forest in Costa Rica,Bombus ephippiatus; flower constancy; Deppea grandiflora; foraging paths; Leandra subseriata; Melastomataceae; Palicourea brenesii; Rubiaceae; stigmatic pollen loads; visitation rates,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLLEN REMOVAL; PLANT; DENSITY,"This study addresses the pollination ecology of shrub species in an upper montane forest in Costa Rica, where the diversity of insect visitors is much below that of the well-studied tropical forests of lower elevations. Data are presented on visitation rates by the tropical bumblebee Bombus ephippiatus to flowers of three species, pollen loads on bumblebee bodies, and pollen loads on stigmas of two of` the species. High visitation rates to flowers of Palicourea brenesii were found, a species which produces copious amounts of nectar. Visitation rates to nectarless Leandra subseriata and Deppea grandiflora were much lower. Conspecific pollen comprised on average 90% of the pollen load on stigmas of Leandra, while Palicourea stigmas carried only 26 to 55% conspecific pollen, With only two ovules per flower, fruit and seed set in Palicourea were not limited by a shortage of conspecific pollen. In Leandra, 20-25% of the flowers received too few conspecific pollen grains for maximum seed set among 440 ovules per flower. Individual bumblebees showed no constancy in plant choice, judging from the high number of different pollen types (6-12) on their bodies. Workers returned frequently to the same Palicourea patch without visiting nearby Palicourea plants, which suggests the use of foraging paths.",2000
Genetic analysis of isozyme variants in open pollinated families of southern beech Nothofagus nervosa (PHIL.) DIM. et MIL.,isozymes; genetic analysis; Nothofagus nervosa (= N. alpina); Nothofagaceae; Fagaceae,FAGUS-SYLVATICA L; INHERITANCE; POPULATIONS; ISOENZYMES; FAGACEAE; HYBRIDS,"Nothofagus nervosa (= N. alpina) represents one of the most important native tree species among the Southern Southamerican Temperate Forest. Its ecological situation in Argentina with a very reduce distribution area, overexploitation in the past, recurrent forest fires and overgrazing makes it a suitable species for conservation and improvement programs. In order to conduct a complete population genetic study of the species in Argentina, isozyme gene markers were determined. Genetic analysis of the observed phenotypic variation was done applying the method described by GILLET and HATTEMER (1989). Twelve loci were analysed corresponding to six enzyme systems. Four of them were monomorphic, but two had species-specific alleles. Among the remainder, genetic control could be demonstrated in five loci and hypothesis on the mode of inheritance of another one has been suggested. Finally, genetic control could not be proved in two loci and discussion on the reliability of these loci as gene markers have been done.",2000
Modeling fossil plant form-function relationships: a critique,,WATER TRANSPORT-SYSTEMS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION; VASCULAR LAND PLANTS; SALIX-HERBACEA L; WIND POLLINATION; STOMATAL DENSITY; ADAPTIVE WALKS; EVOLUTION; PATTERN; BIOMECHANICS,"Attempts to model form-function relationships for fossil plants rely on the facts that the physiological and structural requirements for plant growth, survival, and reproductive success are remarkably similar for the majority of extant and extinct species regardless of phyletic affiliation and that most of these requirements can be quantified by means of comparatively simple mathematical expressions drawn directly from the physical and engineering sciences. Owing in part to the advent and rapid expansion of computer technologies, the number of fossil plant form-function models has burgeoned in the last two decades and encompasses every level of biological organization ranging from molecular self-assembly to ecological and evolutionary dynamics. This recent and expansive interest in modeling fossil plant form-function relationships is discussed in the context of the general philosophy of modeling past biological systems and how the reliability of models can be examined (i.e., direct experimental manipulation or observation of the system being modeled). This philosophy is illustrated and methods of validating models are critiqued in terms of four models drawn from the author's work (the quantification of wind-induced stem bending stresses, wind pollination efficiency of early Paleozoic ovulate reproductive structures, population dynamics and species extinction in monotypic and ""mixed"" communities, and the adaptive radiation of early vascular land plants). The assumptions and logical (mathematical) consequences (predictions) of each model are broadly outlined, and, in each case, the model is shown to be overly simplistic despite its ability to predict the general or particular behavior or operation of the system modeled. Nonetheless, these four models, which illustrate some of pros and cons of modeling fossil form-function relationships, are argued to be pedagogically useful because, like all models, they expose the internal logical consistency of our basic assumptions about how organic form and function interrelate.",2000
Insights into the Witheringia solanacea (Solanaceae) complex in Costa Rica. II. Insect visitors and pollination biology of W-asterotricha and W-meiantha,bees; Costa Rica; La Selva; pollination; Solanaceae; Witheringia,EVOLUTION; FLOWERS; BEES; CONSTRAINTS,"Isolating mechanisms are important in maintaining the taxonomic integrity of closely related sympatric taxa. A previous study found strong post-zygotic isolating barriers between two species, Witheringia asterotricha and W. meiantha, of the W. solanacea (Solanaceae) species complex in Costa pica. This study examines the presence of prezygotic barriers between the two species at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Both species offer pollen and nectar as floral rewards and ale visited primarily by solitary or semi-social bees, some of which sonicate (""buzz"") the anthers to discharge pollen. No evidence was found for phenological differences in flowering time between W. asterotricha and W. meiantha, bur pre-zygotic factors, such as ethological isolation and possibly fine-scale ecological or geographic barriers, may be responsible for restricting gene flow between the two species.",2000
"Bird-pollination of three Durio species (Bombacaceae) in a tropical rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia",bat; Bombacaceae; Durio; giant honey bees; peak flowering period; pollination; spiderhunters,ASEASONAL TROPICS; DIPTEROCARPACEAE; BIOLOGY,"Pollination ecology of three Durio species, D. grandiflorus, D. oblongus, and D. kutejensis (Bombacaceae), was studied in a lowland dipterocarp, forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, during a peak flowering period when at least 305 species of plants bloomed in 1996. Durio has been reported to be pollinated by hats in Peninsular Malaysia. However, my observations of flower visitors and pollination experiments indicated that two species, D. grandiflorus and D, oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and that the other species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and bats as well as birds. Hand-pollination experiments showed that all three species were obligate outbreeders. A resource limitation in fruit production was suggested. The former two species were visited only by spiderhunters, and the bagged flowers that were opened for animal visitors only at night bore no fruit, while those that were opened only during the day bore fruits, at comparable fruiting ratios to open pollination. Durio kutejensis was observed to be visited by gi;mt honey bees. birds, and bats at different times of day, and three series of bagged experiments that exposed the flowers to animal visitors at different times of day bore fruits at a comparable ratio to open-pollination.",2000
Flowering phenology and gender variation in Pennisetum typhoides,allocation to sexual functions; gender; modular structure; pearl millet; Poaceae; pollination regime; ecology; reproductive biology,PLANT SIZE; FEMALE FUNCTION; SEED PRODUCTION; SEX ALLOCATION; PATTERNS; FRUIT,"Because of the modular structure of pearl millet (an annual grass crop, Poaceae), different tillers of a plant share the same genotype but are subjected to different environmental conditions during their maturation. This allows investigation of the effects of tiller flowering phenology on allocation to resource-producing photosynthetic biomass, sexual functions, and thus tiller gender. All tillers of plants of two families collected from individual maternal plants (represented by 33 and 31 plants each) were analyzed. In both families, allocation to aboveground vegetative biomass decreased as flowering was delayed. On average, late-flowering tillers were 65% smaller than the first ones to flower. The proportion of biomass allocated to reproduction significantly increased with the flowering rank of the tillers, suggesting that translocations of assimilates occurred between early- and late-flowering tillers. In both families, late-flowering tillers produced significantly fewer pollen grains per stamen than early-flowering ones, and female reproductive allocation (expressed as seed mass per tiller) was also affected by flowering phenology. Tillers became increasingly female as flowering phenology progressed. This gender variation is possibly adaptive because pollination efficiency is maximized by plant height. Natural selection may favor a shift toward femaleness to maximize reproductive fitness in small, late-developing tillers.",2000
Simulation of the effect of pollinator movement on alfalfa seed set,Medicago sativa; Megachile rotundata; pollination ecology; alfalfa; seed set; foraging behavior,IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA POLEMONIACEAE; PLANT SIZE; SELF-POLLINATION; POLLEN CARRYOVER; GEITONOGAMY; CONSEQUENCES; FLOWER; NUMBER; SYSTEM; BEES,"Using alfalfa grown for seed, we tested the hypothesis that seed set for a awed number of pollinations is lower when the standing crop of open flowers is high than when it is low. This could occur if pollinators are more likely to move between flowers on the same plant, causing self-pollination, when flowers are abundant. The hypothesis has practical implications for agricultural production because self-pollinations produce fewer seeds per pod than do cross-pollinations in alfalfa. We simulated seed set in a model that included published movement patterns of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), and estimates of seed set when a series of flowers on the same giant are hand pollinated. Seed set from a fixed number of pollinations averaged only approximate to6-7% higher when standing crop was low than when standing crop was high. This small increase in seed set would he difficult to detect experimentally because of high variability between plants. M. rotundata appears to move with a 56% probability of leaving a given raceme and a given plant: this foraging behavior results in few flowers visited per plant. A pollinator with a higher probability of leaving racemes and plan ts could set slightly more seed than M. rotundata, whereas a pollinator with a lower probability of leaving racemes and plants would be more affected by newer standing crop than is M. rotundata. The distribution of flowers visited per raceme by bees in alfalfa can be predicted by superimposing the movement probability on the distribution of open flowers per raceme. This conceptualization of bee movement on flowers differs from (but is not mutually exclusive of) resource-driven optimal foraging models, and is useful for predicting geitonogamy.",2000
Flowers produce variations in color saturation by arranging petals at oblique and varying angles,,INSECT POLLINATORS; ECOLOGY; VISION,Large color variations can be observed across the face of a flower even when individual petals are the same color. We investigated whether these color variations could be explained by a model that incorporates multiple reflections of light between petals and transmissions of light through petals before the light returns to the observer. The three flowers that we selected for the study exhibited large color variations across the face of the intact flower but had no significant observable difference in color saturation across a single petal or between petals when petals were removed from the flower. We used a spectroradiometer to measure the spectrum across the faces of intact flowers and across individual petals. The measured spectra for all of the flowers were consistent with the proposed model.,2000

Timed observations were used to describe this pollination system in terms of the structure of the visitor assemblage, foraging patterns and efficiencies of the main insect species. The visitor pool was dominated by anthophorid solitary bees. Furthermore, it was characterized by a high level of endemicity and a small number of species compared with continental relatives of Lavandula. The main visitors, two anthophorids and a bombyliid fly, clearly differed in their foraging behaviour, i.e. visitation frequency, visit duration, rate of flower probing, and in anatomical traits (body size and proboscis length). In these terms, the bees were by far more efficient foragers than the fly. These results are discussed in the context of insect-Bower interactions in insular pollination systems.",2000
Use of functional male sterility in seed production of tomato hybrids,functional male sterility; hybrid seed production; parthenocarpy; plastic houses; tomato,,"The aim of our research is the elaboration of a simple method of tomato hybrid seed production at the development of hybrids F-1 (common and parthenocarpic) on the basis of functional male sterility for ecological conditions of Belarus. The results of study of tomato flowering biology are discussed. The optimal term for pollination without emasculation of functional male sterile forms Z-313 and B-3-1-8 is the 3-6-th days and parthenocarpic functional male sterile forms B-2-2, B-2-5, B-2-6, a-3, a-4, Z-1-3 - the 2-4-th days after the phase of yellow-green bud. Forms with short pistil (C-9464, C-3-1, a-2) may be used in hybrid seed production after the removal of filaments directly before pollination. The existence of a marker gene (potato leaf) gives a good possibility to reject non-hybrid seedlings.",2000

Foundational readings concerning pollen for allergists and aerobiologists,,,"Background: In a medical culture being revolutionized by MEDLINE, MD-Consult, and full-text electronic journals, books are frequently dismissed as antiquated and hopelessly out of date. For those involved in the study of atmospheric pollen, however, books-many several decades old-still represent foundational reading. Objectives: This paper will present and briefly review 17 books dealing with the ecology of plants that cause pollinosis, pollen morphology, pollen movement in the atmosphere, and air sampling techniques. Conclusions: This small collection of books provides a foundation with which to approach the study of atmospheric pollen. Allergists and aerobiologists are encouraged to become familiar with these titles, particularly if they intend to publish pollen data in medical journals.",2000
