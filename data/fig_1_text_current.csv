We investigated which species of pollen are carried by A. jamaicensis in order to determine its potential role as a plant pollinator in the northern Yucatan Peninsula. We collected pollen from the fur of 192 individuals throughout the year from April 2004 to March 2005. We recorded pollen from nine plant species of eight families and found five unidentified pollen types, with the highest pollen species richness recorded in June. A. jamaicensis moved pollen of Erythrina standleyana and Mimosa bahamensis, which have not hitherto been reported as visited by this species. The most abundant pollen in the samples was found to be that of three tree species: Ceiba pentandra, C. aesculifolia and Lysiloma latisiliquum. Very few samples contained pollen in the rainy season, when the bats fed mainly on fruits. A. jamaicensis can fly several kilometres among foraging locations and dispersed large amounts of pollen from tree species growing near cenotes as well as those not present at cenotes but occurring in other forest fragments, highlighting its importance as a pollen vector among forest fragments in the largely deforested landscape of the Yucatan Peninsula, helping to reduce the negative effects of forest fragmentation. Ceiba appears to benefit from the role of A. jamaicensis as a pollen vector, and the species play an important ecological role in the Yucatan landscape, supplying shade, nectar and fruit for wildlife.",2017
Positive responses of flower visiting bees to landscape heterogeneity depend on functional connectivity levels,Functional ecological corridors; Landscape effects; Pollination; Bee richness and abundance; Atlantic forest,HABITAT LOSS; POLLINATION SERVICES; FRAGMENTATION; AGROECOSYSTEMS; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; BEETLES; FOREST; PLANTS; SCALE,"Landscape changes can lead to bee species loss, what impairs proper landscape level pollination processes, impacting both nature conservation and human welfare. Although landscape heterogeneity can rescue bee communities from collapsing, these insects seem sensitive to reduced functional connectivity, hindering pollen transfer among plants. Our objective was to verify which of these two factors, landscape heterogeneity or functional connectivity, can better explain variations of bee abundance and richness in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. We sampled flower-visiting bees in 12 landscapes with varying heterogeneity and functional connectivity measured using a Functional Ecological Corridors framework. Both richness and abundance were affected by landscape factors, reaching its highest levels at intermediate levels of functional connectivity in highly heterogeneous landscapes, indicating the existence of strong regime shifts in the system. In low-forested landscapes, conservation actions for pollinating bees should focus on implementing diversified environments with high quality which are interspersed among each other and with native vegetation.

Spatiotemporal changes in flying insect abundance and their functional diversity as a function of distance to natural habitats in a mass flowering crop,Body size; Flower-visitors; Functional diversity; Isolation from natural habitat; Mangoes; Morphological traits; Wing span,LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; POLLINATION SERVICES; BODY-SIZE; FRUIT-SET; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; SAMPLING TECHNIQUES; SPECIES RESPONSES; BEE POLLINATORS; NATIVE BEES; WILD BEES,"To meet the dietary requirements of a burgeoning human population, the demand for animal-dependent crops continues to grow. To meet the demand, intensive farming practices are used. The gains in food production associated with agricultural intensification may be offset by its detrimental effects on pollinator populations through natural habitat fragmentation and pesticide use. Abundance and species richness of pollinators have been found to decrease with increasing distance to natural habitat in agroecosystems, reducing crop yields. A key aspect of crop pollination lies in the diversity of functional traits (functional diversity, FD) of flower-visitor communities within crop fields. Higher FD allows improved pollination success through complementarity between flower-visitors' morphology, phenology and behaviour. Many studies reported negative effects of increasing distance to natural habitats on the abundance and richness of flower-visitor communities, but the link between FD and natural habitat isolation is less well understood. Also, a more complete understanding of the functional traits of flower visitor communities within crops should consider potential variations through time. Differences in resources availability between seasons are important in tropical areas and could modify ecological responses of flower-visitor communities to isolation. In this study, we surveyed the Hymenoptera and Diptera communities within mango orchards of South Africa using pan traps at 100 m, 200 m and at the maximal distance possible from any natural habitat. We measured the response of insect abundance, wing span and body size as well as functional diversity to habitat isolation during mango flowering (dry season), and during the wet season (after mango fruit harvest). Flying insect abundance decreased with increasing distance to natural habitat during mango flowering, but no effect was detected during the wet season. FD of flying insects declined with increasing distance to natural habitat in both sampling periods. Insects captured during mango flowering were smaller but had higher wing length/body length ratios than those caught during the wet season. This study highlights that mango orchards are more inhospitable for flying insects during mango flowering. This effect might be due to low palatability of mango flowers, or pesticide use in mango fields. In order to maintain a high FD of flower-visiting species, and reduce the detrimental effects of habitat isolation to ultimately ensure better crop pollination, we propose establishment of patches of resource-rich habitats combined with judicious use of pesticides within orchards.

Asteraceae invaders have limited impacts on the pollination of common native annual species in SW Western Australia's open woodland wildflower communities,Pollen limitation; Biological invasion; Annual plants; Indirect interactions,POLLEN LIMITATION; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; FLORAL DIVERSITY; MODEL SELECTION; COMPETITION; VISITATION; NEIGHBORHOOD; MUTUALISMS; EVOLUTION,"The York gum-jam woodlands of southwest Western Australia support diverse annual wildflower communities despite extensive habitat fragmentation, remnant isolation and the invasion of many exotic annual plant species. Few studies have explored the pollinator-plant relationships maintaining these persistently species-rich 'novel' communities. We examine the pollination ecology of five native species common to York gum-jam woodland annual communities to determine whether native pollinators may be mediating impacts of exotic annual plants on native wildflower species. We determined the pollination requirements of native focal species and the diversity and frequency of pollinator visitation to these focal plant species across invasion gradients. We also recorded the pollinator community of a dominant exotic herb in this system: Arctotheca calendula (cape weed). Only two of the five native species examined had significant seed set benefits attributable to insect pollination. One native plant species, Podotheca gnaphalioides, had pollinator assemblages that overlapped significantly with exotic A. calendula, with some reduction in pollinator visitation evident. One species, Waitzia acuminata, was found to benefit from insect pollination only in the larger of two surveyed remnants, which may reflect emerging reproductive polymorphism among geographically isolated populations. We highlight two mechanisms in this system that may buffer pollinator-mediated impacts of exotic species on native species: autonomous seed production, which may be increasingly prevalent in isolated populations, and segregation of pollinator resources among species. Our findings illustrate the ways that pollinator-mediated interactions can affect seed set within plant communities persisting in highly fragmented and invaded agricultural landscapes.",2015
Changing odour landscapes: the effect of anthropogenic volatile pollutants on plant-pollinator olfactory communication,air pollution; floral volatiles; flowering communities; olfactory signalling; plant-insect communication,ORGANIC-COMPOUND EMISSIONS; FLORAL SCENT; AIR-POLLUTION; OZONE; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; DISCRIMINATION; DEGRADATION; INFORMATION,"1. Olfactory signals, often in synergy with visual signals, mediate the interactions between plants and animals. However, urbanization and agricultural practices are both sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have the potential to interfere with plant-animal communication and to disrupt mutualistic interactions. In this review, we explore how anthropogenic airborne pollutants may disrupt chemical information transfer between flowering plants and flower visitors. 2. The emission of anthropogenic volatile pollutants (AVPs) including VOCs and formation of ROS, for example from traffic or industries, and non-natural biogenic VOCs, for example from introduced crops, may have a number of effects: (i) changes in plant signalling as a consequence of plants experiencing physiological stress; (ii) chemical interference (chemical degradation/transformation of infochemicals); (iii) increased levels of background noise impeding signal detection; and (iv) changes in pollinator signal perception and behaviour. All of the above in turn could have consequences for the biological fitness of plants and animals that rely on olfactory information as pivotal functional signals. 3. The study of anthropogenic airborne pollutants and their effects on plant signalling is just emerging and the impacts of this aspect of anthropogenic emissions are barely understood. Volatiles emitted from anthropogenically changed landscapes could, however, have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning in adjacent natural zones, particularly in fragmented landscapes. In response to the wide gap in our knowledge on the mechanisms that govern interference of anthropogenic VOCs with olfactory information, future research directions are proposed with the aim to inspire research to help elucidate the risks of anthropogenic VOCs for plant-pollinator communities and improve risk assessment strategies.",2017
Pollination and Reproductive Biology in a Hill Prairie Population of Nothocalais cuspidata (Asteraceae: Cichorieae),,SELF-INCOMPATIBLE PLANT; POLLEN-LIMITATION; ECHINACEA-ANGUSTIFOLIA; DEPRESSED POLLINATION; FURCATUS ASTERACEAE; SEED SET; CONSEQUENCES; SCROPHULARIACEAE; QUANTITY; ECOLOGY,"Nothocalais cuspidata (Pursh) Greene (Asteraceae) is a plant species of conservation concern in Missouri; it typically occurs as isolated populations in hill and sand prairies which are themselves rare and fragmented habitats. The present study was undertaken to understand its reproductive biology as a hill prairie member and the possibility of reduced reproductive output in this isolated habitat. Nothocalais cuspidata is an early spring-flowering, nonclonal, primarily self-incompatible perennial that exhibits a 4 wk flowering phenology with most florets open to cross-pollination over a 2-3 wk period. The attractive UV reflective florets were visited by six species of halictid and solitary bees. The study population did experience depressed reproductive output in 2014 compared to 2004, with open-pollinated florets producing 19.1% fewer fruits than in 2004 along with a 37% decline in population size over a 13 y period. We suggest the depressed fruit production experienced is likely due to the unpredictable spring weather associated with early flowering and sporadic pollinator visitation in an isolated habitat leading to large variations in reproductive success over time or a reduction in compatible mating types as the population declines.",2017

We investigated the reproductive ecology of three isolated populations of A. meadii over five seasons (2010-14) in Missouri and Kansas. Experimental hand-pollinations showed that flowers at all sites were incapable of automatic self-pollination autogamy) and lacked early acting self-incompatibility. The average number of ovaries with pollen tubes in open (insect-mediated) pollination varied from 0.10 to 0.81 depending on site and season. The conversion rate of ovaries into fruits never exceeded more than two fruits per umbel with insect-mediated fruit set varying from 0% to 50% according to site and season. Nectar was the only reward with a per-flower volume as high as 5 mu L containing dissolved sugars from 21% to >= 50%. The nectar was hexose dominant, and the amino acid content was limited to aspartic acid and arginine. Nectar-drinking insects were common visitors at all sites, but only three taxa in the family Apidae (Anthophora abrupta, Apis mellifera, and Bombus species) were consistent carriers of A. meadii pollinaria on their legs. Density and diversity of these three pollinaria carrying taxa also varied according to site and season. Although all three taxa were successful pollinaria vectors, the nonnative A. mellifera does not appear to be as efficient as the native species in the two other bee genera. Our findings offer evidence that Bombus species are especially successful in vectoring pollinaria between flowers of A. meadii; that pollen tubes are successfully reaching the ovaries in insect-mediated, hand-self, and hand-cross pollination events; and that automatic self-pollination (autogamy) does not occur.",2017
The phylogenetic structure of plant-pollinator networks increases with habitat size and isolation,Area effect; co-phylogenetic correspondence; habitat islands; isolation; mutualistic networks; Pampas; phylogenetic structure; pollination webs,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES; DIVERSITY; COEVOLUTION; SPECIALIZATION; FRAGMENTATION; TREE; CONSEQUENCES; BIOLOGY; SHAPE,"Similarity among species in traits related to ecological interactions is frequently associated with common ancestry. Thus, closely related species usually interact with ecologically similar partners, which can be reinforced by diverse co-evolutionary processes. The effect of habitat fragmentation on the phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions and correspondence between plant and animal phylogenies is, however, unknown. Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant-animal interactions depend on habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12 pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the phylogenetic structure of interaction webs. A decrease in phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic correspondence in plant-pollinator interactions could be associated with less reliable mutualism and erratic co-evolutionary change.",2016
Plant ecology meets animal cognition: impacts of animal memory on seed dispersal,Animal behaviour; Frugivory; Animal learning; Animal memory seed dispersal; Endozoochory; Plant-animal interactions,LONG-TERM-MEMORY; SPATIAL MEMORY; GEOCHELONE-DENTICULATA; FRUIT-REMOVAL; NORTHWESTERN BRAZIL; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; TROPICAL FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PATTERNS; TIME,"We propose that an understanding of animal learning and memory is critical to predicting the impacts of animals on plant populations through processes such as seed dispersal, pollination and herbivory. Focussing on endozoochory, we review the evidence that animal memory plays a role in seed dispersal, and present a model which allows us to explore the fundamental consequences of memory for this process. We demonstrate that decision-making by animals based on their previous experiences has the potential to determine which plants are visited, which fruits are selected to be eaten from the plant and where seeds are subsequently deposited, as well as being an important determinant of animal survival. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of animal learning and memory on seed dispersal is likely to be extremely important, although to date our understanding of these processes suffers from a conspicuous lack of empirical support. This is partly because of the difficulty of conducting appropriate experiments but is also the result of limited interaction between plant ecologists and those who work on animal cognition. We believe that an improved understanding of the effects of animal memory in endozoochorous interactions will allow better prediction of the impacts of ecosystem changes such as habitat fragmentation, introductions of novel species of plants and animals and reintroductions of animal populations to areas from which they have been extirpated, and hope that the ideas we put forward here provide an impetus for further work in this area.",2016

However, the way in which the pollen loads transported by pollinators and deposited on stigmas are affected by pollination context has been little studied. We investigated the impacts of plant mate and visiting insect availabilities on pollen transport and receipt in a mass-flowering and facultative autogamous shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum). First, we recorded insect visits to R. ferrugineum in plant patches of diverse densities and sizes. Second, we analyzed the pollen loads transported by R. ferrugineum pollinators and deposited on stigmas of emasculated and intact flowers, in the same patches. Overall, pollinators (bumblebees) transported much larger pollen loads than the ones found on stigmas, and the pollen deposited on stigmas included a high proportion of conspecific pollen. However, comparing pollen loads of emasculated and intact flowers indicated that pollinators contributed only half the conspecific pollen present on the stigma. At low plant density, we found the highest visitation rate and the lowest proportion of conspecific pollen transported and deposited by pollinators. By contrast, at higher plant density and lower visitation rate, pollinators deposited larger proportion of conspecific pollen, although still far from sufficient to ensure that all the ovules were fertilized. Finally, self-pollen completely buffered the detrimental effects on pollination of patch fragmentation and pollinator failure. Our results indicate that pollen loads from pollinators and emasculated flowers should be quantified for an accurate understanding of the relative impacts of pollinator and mate limitation on pollen transfer in facultative autogamous species.",2016
Effects of forest and cave proximity on fruit set of tree crops in tropical orchards in Southern Thailand,bat; cave; durian; forest proximity; mango; rambutan; stingless bee; tropical rain forest,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; DURIAN DURIO-ZIBETHINUS; STINGLESS BEES; NATIVE BEES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; MACADAMIA FLOWERS; BATS PTEROPODIDAE; FORAGING RANGES,"Deforestation and forest fragmentation are contributing to declines in crop pollinator populations worldwide. Several studies have examined the impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community, because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency, and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10 pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source habitats. Maintaining forest patches and limestone karsts may provide stepping stones across fragmented landscapes, and attract greater numbers of pollinators to agricultural areas.",2016

While some species damage millions of hectares of crops annually, the biology of many species is little known. We assessed the utility of a 797 base pair fragment of the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene to resolve molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) in 750 adult pollen beetles sampled from flowers of 63 plant species sampled across the UK and continental Europe. We used the same locus to analyse region-scale patterns in population structure and demography in an economically important pest, Brassicogethes aeneus. We identified 44 Meligethinae at similar to 2% divergence, 35 of which contained published sequences. A few specimens could not be identified because the MOTUs containing them included published sequences for multiple Linnaean species, suggesting either retention of ancestral haplotype polymorphism or identification errors in published sequences. Over 90% of UK specimens were identifiable as B. aeneus. Plant associations of adult B. aeneus were found to be far wider taxonomically than for their larvae. UK B. aeneus populations showed contrasting affiliations between the north (most similar to Scandinavia and the Baltic) and south (most similar to western continental Europe), with strong signatures of population growth in the south.",2016
Visitation rate of pollinators and nectar robbers to the flowers and inflorescences of Tabebuia aurea (Bignoniaceae): effects of floral display size and habitat fragmentation,pollination ecology; pollinator behaviour; reproductive biology,PROPORTIONALLY FEWER FLOWERS; FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; MIMULUS-RINGENS; INSECT POLLINATORS; TROPICAL SHRUB; PLANT-DENSITY; BUMBLE BEES; BEHAVIOR; HUMMINGBIRDS; METAANALYSIS,"Large floral displays favour pollinator attraction and the import and export of pollen. However, large floral displays also have negative effects, such as increased geitonogamy, pollen discounting and nectar/pollen robber attraction. The size of the floral display can be measured at different scales (e.g. the flower, inflorescence or entire plant) and variations in one of these scales may affect the behaviour of flower visitors in different ways. Moreover, the fragmentation of natural forests may affect flower visitation rates and flower visitor behaviour. In the present study, video recordings of the inflorescences of a tree species (Tabebuia aurea) from the tropical savannah of central Brazil were used to examine the effect of floral display size at the inflorescence and tree scales on the visitation rate of pollinators and nectar robbers to the inflorescence, the number of flowers approached per visit, the number of visits per flower of potential pollinators and nectar robbers, and the interaction of these variables with the degree of landscape disturbance. Nectar production was quantified with respect to flower age. Although large bees are responsible for most of the pollination, a great diversity of flower insects visit the inflorescences of T.aurea. Other bee and hummingbird species are highly active nectar robbers. Increases in inflorescence size increase the visitation rate of pollinators to inflorescences, whereas increases in the number of inflorescences on the tree decrease visitation rates to inflorescences and flowers. This effect has been strongly correlated with urban environments in which trees with the largest floral displays are observed. Pollinating bees (and nectar robbers) visit few flowers per inflorescence and concentrate visits to a fraction of available flowers, generating an overdispersed distribution of the number of visits per inflorescence and per flower. This behaviour reflects preferential visits to young flowers (including flower buds) with a greater nectar supply.",2016

Using interactions between nectarivorous birds (hummingbirds and flowerpiercers) arid flowering plants in high elevation forests (i.e., ""elfin"" forests) of the Andes, we explore the importance of biological constraints and neutral processes (random interactions) to explain the observed species interactions and network metrics, such as connectance, specialization, nestedness and asymmetry. In cold environments of elfin forests, which are located at the top of the tropical montane forest zone many plants are adapted for pollination by birds making this an ideal system to study plant pollinator networks. To build the network of interactions between birds and plants, we used direct field observations. We measured abundance of birds using mist-nets and flower abundance using transects, and phenology by scoring presence of birds and flowers over time. We compared the length of birds' bills to flower length to identify ""forbidden interactions"" those interactions that could not result in legitimate floral visits based on mis-match in morphology. Diglossa flowerpiercers, which are characterized as ""illegitimate"" flower visitors, were relatively abundant. We found that the elfin forest network was nested with phenology being the factor that best explained interaction frequencies and nestedness, providing support for biological constraints hypothesis. We did not find morphological constraints to be important in explaining observed interaction frequencies and network metrics. Other network metrics (connectance, evenness and asymmetry), however, were better predicted by abundance (neutral process) models. Flo werpiercers, which cut holes and access flowers at their base and, consequently, facilitate nectar access for other hummingbirds, explain, why morphological mis-matches were relatively unimportant in this system. Future work should focus on how changes in abundance and phenology, likely results of climate change and habitat fragmentation, and the role of nectar robbers impact ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant pollinator (or flower-visitor) interactions.",2016

These elements are crucial in restoration program to limit inbreeding depression and to maintain the genetic diversity of natural populations. In the remnant fragments of tropical dry forest in Mayotte (Comoros Archipelago, Indian Ocean), the clarification of the reproductive strategies of the orphan leafless Vanilla humblotii Rchb. f. will provide a better understanding of its fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Approaches combining reproductive biology and fine-scale spatial genetic structure analyses using ten microsatellite markers in 49 individuals sampled in the only remaining large population of V. humblotii were employed to unravel the reproductive strategies of this species. The results showed that V. humblotii displays unscented flowers and is allogamous and pollinator-dependent although also self-compatible. A total absence of pollen movements and a low level of natural fruit set (similar to 1%) are reported, although a wild bee (Allodape obscuripennis Strand, Xylocopinae) and a bird (Nectarinia coquerelli, Nectarinidae) visited the flowers. A high genotypic diversity (G/N = 0.88) and a phalanx clonal growth are detected, and seed dispersal is higher than pollen dispersal. The phalanx distribution of the repeated genotypes (ramets arisen from the same genet) is responsible for significant autocorrelations detected at small distances. Limited inbreeding was detected although geitonogamy could have been enhanced by vegetative reproduction. This study highlights the need to perform interdisciplinary studies to unravel the reproductive strategy of clonal plant species with a deceptive pollination system. ",2016
Different pollinator assemblages ensure reproductive success of Cleisostoma linearilobatum (Orchidaceae) in fragmented holy hill forest and traditional tea garden,,SPECIALIZATION; CONSERVATION; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; POLLEN; FRUIT; CHINA,"Orchids are generally recognized to have specialist pollination systems and low fruit set is often thought to be characteristic of the family. In this study, we investigated the reproductive ecology of Cleisostoma linearilobatum, an epiphytic tropical orchid, in a holy hill forest fragment and a traditional tea garden in SW China using comparable methods. C. linearilobatum is self-compatible and dependent on insects for pollination. Fruit production in natural conditions was both pollinator- and resource-limited. However, the natural fruit set remained stable over multiple years at both sites. Pollination observations showed that C. linearilobatum has a generalized pollination system and seven insect species were observed as legitimate pollinators. Although the visit frequencies of different pollinators were different in the two sites, the pollinator assemblages ensured reproductive success of C. linearilobatum in both study sites over multiple years. The results partly explain why C. linearilobatum is so successful in the area, and also suggest that holy hill forest fragments and traditional tea gardens in Xishuangbanna are important in preserving orchids, especially those with generalist pollination.",2016

One of the signs of deteriorating zoogamous plant reproduction is pollen limitation, often associated with a decline in pollinator diversity and abundance. Various authors predict that the most vulnerable taxa are outbreeding plant species characterized by specialist pollination systems. We have, therefore, focused on self-incompatible Corydalis solida, an ancient forest, spring ephemeral plant, growing in three remnant urban populations in the city of Warsaw (Poland). Over two years, we checked for pollen limitation and recorded insect diversity and abundance for C. solida flowers. Our study populations composed of self-incompatible individuals were mainly visited by generalist pollinators, and produced more seeds when supplementally pollinated. Pollen limitation, however, was greater during 1 year with an early spring onset, when we observed a decline in floral visitors diversity and activity. This was probably an effect of phenological mismatch between plants and their pollinators, in this case, mostly social bees, i.e., over-wintered bumblebee queens and Apis mellifera. We conclude that for outbreeding zoogamous spring ephemerals, such as C. solida serviced by generalist pollinators, changing climatic conditions may override the effects of habitat fragmentation and influence their reproductive success.",2016

Islands represent one system potentially suitable to analyze the effects of spatial isolation. Here, we examine the contribution that differences in visitor composition make to increased selfing and seed production by examining the major visitors to Plectritis congesta in populations on the Gulf Islands and Vancouver Island, We find that (1) connectivity is more strongly associated with visitor assemblages and seed production than components of the floral community and (2) taking phylogeny into account suggests that increased visitation by solitary bees as opposed to other functional groups increases female fitness in P. congesta.",2015

Such processes can also lead to changes in the genetic structure of these populations. This study investigated the populations of Rhododendron ponticum in its introduced range in Ireland, where it is severely invasive, to determine both genetic and flower width diversity and differentiation. We compared six introduced Irish populations with two populations from R. ponticum's native range in Spain, using amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat genetic markers. We measured flower width, a trait that may affect pollinator visitation, from four Irish and four Spanish populations by measuring both the width at the corolla tip and tube base (nectar holder width). With both genetic markers, populations were differentiated between Ireland and Spain and from each other in both countries. However, populations displayed low genetic diversity (mean Nei's genetic diversity = 0.22), with the largest proportion (76-93 %) of genetic variation contained within, rather than between, populations. Although corolla width was highly variable between individuals within populations, tube width was significantly wider (>0.5 mm) in introduced, compared with native, populations. Our results show that the same species can have genetically distinct populations in both invasive and native regions, and that differences in floral width may occur, possibly in response to ecological sorting processes or local adaptation to pollinator communities.",2015

These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest. We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 +/- 2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments. The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers' decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers' formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices.

Pollen limitation affects reproductive outcome in the bird-pollinated mangrove Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (Lam.) in a highly urbanized environment,Conservation; Genetics; Fragmentation; Mating system; Outcrossing; Pollination,POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; AEGICERAS-CORNICULATUM; RHIZOPHORACEAE; CONSERVATION; FOREST; SUCCESS; BIOLOGY; SPECIALIZATION; FRAGMENTATION; PERSPECTIVE,"Urban mangrove systems are increasingly common in SE Asia but little is known about the potential changes in pollinator ecology in highly urbanized and fragmented landscapes. We detected pollen limitation across four Bruguiera gymnorrhiza populations in Singapore with a pollen limitation index (compromised seed production due to insufficient pollen receipt) ranging from 0.633 to 0.878. Trees in larger patches had higher pollinator visitation rates than in smaller patches, and lower pollinator visitation rates resulted in reduced fruit sets. These results suggest a cascading link between habitat patch size, pollinator visitation rate, and reproductive outcomes in B. gymnorrhiza. Mating system analysis indicated that B. gymnorrhiza may have an internal mechanism acting against inbreeding depression, leading to reduced fruit set under circumstances of reduced pollinator visitation. Our results underscore the importance of pollinator service in mangroves and highlight the need for an in-depth understanding of changing plant-pollinator relationships in urban mangroves systems.

Urbanization-induced habitat fragmentation erodes multiple components of temporal diversity in a Southern California native bee assemblage,,BETA DIVERSITY; POLLINATION; COMMUNITIES; TURNOVER; GRADIENT; PLANTS; BIODIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; ECOSYSTEM; SHIFTS,"Despite a large number of ecological studies that document diversity loss resulting from anthropogenic disturbance, surprisingly few consider how disturbance affects temporal patterns of diversity that result from seasonal turnover of species. Temporal dynamics can play an important role in the structure and function of biological assemblages. Here, we investigate the temporal diversity patterns of bee faunas in Southern California coastal sage scrub ecosystems that have been extensively fragmented by urbanization. Using a two-year dataset of 235 bee species (n = 12,036 specimens), we compared 1-ha plots in scrub fragments and scrub reserves with respect to three components of temporal diversity: overall plot-level diversity pooled over time (temporal gamma diversity), diversity at discrete points in time (temporal alpha diversity), and seasonal turnover in assemblage composition (temporal beta diversity). Compared to reserves, fragments harbored bee assemblages with lower species richness and assemblage evenness both when summed across temporal samples (i.e., lower temporal gamma diversity) and at single points in time (i.e., lower temporal alpha diversity). Bee assemblages in fragments also exhibited reduced seasonal turnover (i.e., lower temporal beta diversity). While fragments and reserves did not differ in overall bee abundance, bee abundance in fragments peaked later in the season compared to that in reserves. Our results argue for an increased awareness of temporal diversity patterns, as information about the distinct components of temporal diversity is essential both for characterizing the assemblage dynamics of seasonal organisms and for identifying potential impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystem function through its effects on assemblage dynamics.",2017

Correctly interpreting the influence of habitat characteristics on native bee communities is necessary to develop effective strategies for bee conservation and to support the provision of pollination services to agricultural crops or natural plant communities. Biases imposed by different sampling methods used to monitor bee populations can affect our ability to discern important habitat characteristics, but the extent of this bias is not well understood. We used three common sampling methods (blue vane traps, colored pan traps, and aerial net collection) to assess bee communities in fragments of Palouse Prairie in eastern Washington and northern Idaho. We determined differences in abundance, species richness, proportional representation of different genera, and functional trait characteristics among the three sampling techniques. We also evaluated differences in the relationships between bee species richness and diversity and two key habitat variables known to mediate bee populations: local plant species richness and the amount of suitable bee habitat in the surrounding landscape. Community metrics for bees collected using blue vane traps were correlated with the amount of suitable habitat in the landscape but not with plant species richness. Conversely, community metrics for bees collected using an aerial net were correlated with the local plant species richness but not with the amount of suitable habitat. Our results indicate that effective conservation of insect communities will require a combination of sampling methods to reliably discern the influence of habitat variables at different scales and across taxa with varying functional traits.",2017

Nature conservation policies need to deliver on multiple criteria, including genetic diversity, population viability and species richness as well as ecosystem services. The challenge of integrating these may be addressed by simulation modelling. 2. We used four models (MetaConnect, SPOMSIM, a community model and InVEST) to assess a variety of spatial habitat patterns with two levels of total habitat cover and realised at two spatial scales, exploring which landscape structures performed best according to five different conservation criteria assessed for four functional types of organisms (approximately representing trees, butterflies, small mammals and birds). 3. The results display both synergies and trade-offs: population size and pollination services generally benefitted more from fragmentation than did genetic heterozygosity, and species richness more than allelic richness, although the latter two varied considerably among the functional types. 4. No single landscape performed best across all conservation criteria, but averaging over criteria and functional types, overall performance improved with greater levels of habitat cover and intermediate fragmentation (or less fragmentation in cases with lower habitat cover). 5. Policy implications. Using four simulation models, we show that different conservation objectives must be traded off in spatial conservation planning, and that considering only a single taxon or criterion may result in suboptimal choices when planning reserve networks. Nevertheless, heterogeneous spatial patterns of habitat can provide reasonable compromises for multiple criteria.",2017
Global patterns of mainland and insular pollination networks,Continental islands; ecological networks; macroecology; mutualistic networks; oceanic islands; plant-insect interactions; sampling effort,MUTUALISTIC INTERACTION NETWORKS; SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; SAMPLING COMPLETENESS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SPECIALIZATION; NESTEDNESS; ISLANDS; BIODIVERSITY,"Aim Interaction networks are being increasingly used to evaluate macroecological patterns. We explored a global dataset to identify differences in the structure of pollination networks from islands (of oceanic and continental origin) and mainlands. For oceanic islands, we further evaluated the effects of key island traits on network structural parameters. Location Fifty-two quantitative plant-pollinator networks from continental islands (n = 23), oceanic islands (n = 18) and mainlands (n = 11) located world-wide. Methods The effect of geographical origin upon network structure was explored by means of generalized mixed models, accounting for biogeographical region, sampling intensity, latitude and network size. For oceanic island networks, the influence of area, age, elevation and isolation was also evaluated. Results The structure of pollination networks was fairly consistent between mainland and continental islands and only a few differences were noted. Oceanic island networks, however, were smaller and topologically simplified, showing a lower interaction diversity, and higher plant niche overlap than mainland and continental island networks. Isolation and elevational range of oceanic islands influenced the total number of species and interactions. Networks from higher-elevation oceanic islands were less nested and those located towards the equator exhibited higher interaction richness. Island area showed no significant effect on any of the network metrics studied here. Main conclusions Pollination networks appear structurally similar regardless of their geographical origin. However, networks from continental islands are more similar to their mainland counterparts than to those from oceanic islands, probably due to the geological nature of continental islands, which are fragments of the mainland to which they were once connected. Oceanic island networks are the least species-and link-rich, and exhibit the lowest interaction diversity and the highest plant niche overlap, possibly due to lower pollinator richness. The most isolated and low-elevation islands show the simplest networks, and are thus probably the most vulnerable to pollination disruptions.",2016

However, several life-history and ecological traits can influence the response to population size reduction. The reproductive patterns, levels of genetic diversity and magnitude of inbreeding depression of the rare and fragmented Jumellea fragrans and of its widespread congener J. rossii were studied. The aim was to evaluate the effects of over-collection and fragmentation on J. fragrans and to enhance our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the two species, used for their aromatic and medicinal properties on Re ' union. Methods Hand pollination experiments were conducted to determine the breeding system and to evaluate the potential for inbreeding depression in both species. Nuclear microsatellite markers were used to investigate selfing rates and levels of genetic diversity. Key Results Jumellea rossii revealed a mixed-mating system, and inbreeding depression at the germination stage (delta = 0 center dot 66). Levels of genetic diversity were relatively high [allelic richness (A(R)) = 8 center dot 575 and expected heterozygosity (H-e) = 0 center dot 673]. In J. fragrans, selfing rates suggest a mainly outcrossing mating system. Genetic diversity was lower than in J. rossii, but not yet critically low (A(R) = 4 center dot 983 and H-e = 0 center dot 492), probably because of the mainly outcrossing mating system and the relatively high density of individuals in the studied population. Jumellea fragrans did not show inbreeding depression, and it is hypothesized that the population had progressively purged its genetic load during successive fragmentation events. Conclusions Even if the persistence of the J. fragrans population is not threatened in the short term, its genetic diversity has probably been reduced by fragmentation and over-collection. In situ conservation actions for J. fragrans and ex situ cultivation of both species are recommended in order to meet the demand of local people.",2016
Can pollination syndromes indicate ecological restoration success in tropical forests?,floral syndromes; habitat complexity; landscape; pollinators; riparian forest,PHENOLOGICAL PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; BRAZIL; TREES,"We evaluated the pollination syndromes of plant species occurring in revegetated patches of riparian Atlantic Forest in order to evaluate the success of restoration process. Between March 2013 and January 2014, the floral traits of all of the flowering plants found in, among four restoration sites of different ages and one reference site, were recorded and used to characterize pollination syndromes. Richness, abundance, and composition of pollination syndromes were related to season, age and width of the forest fragment, species richness and abundance of sampled plants, and also to the quality of the surrounding matrix. There were differences in the composition of syndromes among sampling units and among seasons. Richness and abundance of pollination syndromes varied among climatic periods, the highest values occurred at the end of the dry season and the start of the rainy season. Older, wider, and areas with more plants had higher values of richness and abundance of syndromes. The quality of the surrounding matrix influences only the richness of syndromes. It was concluded that floral traits are good indicators of ecological restoration of riparian forests and that the surrounding matrix contributes to the greater richness of syndromes. However, when planning for active restoration, attention should be given to the proper choice of plant species on the basis of pollination syndromes that should attract pollinators.",2016
THE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE ON FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF ATLANTIC FOREST BIRDS,avifauna; bird functional groups; fragmentation; habitat patch size; matrix,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; TROPICAL FOREST; ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION; COFFEE PLANTATIONS; SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS,"In the current scenario of human transformation of natural landscapes, fragmentation and habitat loss is considered one of the major threats to biodiversity. The characteristics of altered landscapes and remaining habitat patches influence the persistence of species and, as a direct consequence, the functioning of ecological processes. The main focus of studies at landscape scale is to understand how human modifications in natural areas lead to changes in abundance and richness of species. However, such approaches do not directly describe the functional composition of communities, nor do they describe the functional responses to fragmentation and habitat loss. Birds are an interesting taxonomic group to explore this theme, since they present important, broadly-described ecological functions for human modified habitats (e.g., seed dispersal, pollination, and insect pest control). Thus, we aimed to explore the functional responses of birds to landscape characteristics. We selected 14 human modified landscapes of Atlantic forest, found within a radius of 30 km of Alfenas, Brazil. Each landscape was characterized by metrics describing landscape configuration and composition, such as forest percentage and mean connectivity. Birds were sampled in the central patches of the landscapes and classified into 15 functional groups, based on species' traits. We constructed Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and used Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to identify the best models that explained the abundance and richness of species in each functional group. Few groups had high functional redundancy, showing the fragility of the majority of functional groups in the current modified landscapes. Forest dependent functional groups were favored by connected landscapes, higher percentage of forest cover, and high percentages of coffee matrix. On the other hand, forest independent groups were favored by irregular habitat areas and negatively impacted by forest cover and sugar cane matrices. Consistent management of altered landscapes, based on functional responses, can assist the recovery and maintenance of natural areas. We highlight the complexity involved in landscape management, considering it requires simultaneous work on composition and configuration.",2016
The diverse effects of habitat fragmentation on plant-pollinator interactions,Habitat fragmentation; Pollination interaction; Biodiversity; Phenology; Reproductive fitness; Specialization and generalization; Asymmetry,FOREST FRAGMENTATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRY FOREST; WILD BEES; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; PARALLEL EVOLUTION; PATCH OCCUPANCY,"Habitat fragmentation affects a wide variety of biological variables including species' abundance and richness (population demography), phenology, male and female reproductive fitness, and it also affects the degree of specialization versus generalization of pollination networks. Evidence is accumulating that suggests that habitat fragmentation can have significant impacts on plant-pollinator interactions. In this article, we review the literature on habitat fragmentation effects on plants, pollinators, and the pollination network. We also discuss pollination network mechanisms that may be affected by habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations and affects ecological properties at both population and community levels. Evidence shows that habitat size and connectivity directly or indirectly influence the abundance of both plant and pollinator species. In general, plant and pollinator diversity and population size decrease with the decreasing size and habitat connectivity. Habitat fragmentation of plant communities can shift plant phenological patterns, contract flowering periods and increase the risk of local pollinator extirpation. Fragmentation has the potential to influence pollination dynamics by altering pollinator or plant densities and by altering pollinator behavior. However, evidence for the impact of habitat fragmentation on plant species' flowering phenology is relatively limited, and little is known about the effect of habitat fragmentation on the phenology of pollinators. Habitat fragmentation also leads to reduced reproduction in many species. In contrast, other species showed neutral or positive responses to habitat fragmentation in female reproductive fitness, especially in plants regularly affected by pollen limitation and pollination limitation which lead to plants' experience selection for increased autogamy in isolated habitats. Habitat fragmentation often leads to the extirpation of specialist species and results in an influx of generalists. However, studies have shown that pollinators tend to be more generalized as habitat fragmentation increases. The reason is that habitat fragmentation changes the composition of the flora, and scatters floral resources, so any remaining pollinators may need to behave as generalists in order to survive. However, the knowledge of potential ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation is limited, especially regarding the effects on a long-term scale and at landscape scales. We propose experiments involving long-term monitoring, permanent samples of flowering plants, pollinators, and their interactions at large spatial and temporal scales.",2016
Susceptibility of pollinators to ongoing landscape changes depends on landscape history,Bees; biodiversity loss; butterflies; extinction debt; habitat composition; fragmentation and configuration; hoverflies,RAIN-FOREST FRAGMENTATION; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; SPECIES RICHNESS; EXTINCTION DEBT; WILD POLLINATORS; HABITAT EDGES; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; RESPONSES; MANAGEMENT,"Aim Pollinators play an important role in ecosystem functioning, affecting also crop production. Their decline may hence lead to serious ecological and economic impacts, making it essential to understand the processes that drive pollinator shifts in space and time. Land-use changes are thought to be one of the most important drivers of pollinators' loss, and there is increasing investment on pollinator-friendly landscape management. However, it is still unclear whether landscape history of a given region determines how pollinator communities respond to further landscape modification. LocationThe Netherlands. methods using geographically explicit historical landscape and pollinator data from the Netherlands, we evaluated how species richness changes of three important pollinator groups (bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are affected by landscape changes related to habitat composition, fragmentation and species spillover potential and whether such effects depend on the historical characteristics of the landscape. results the effect of landscape changes varied between different pollinator groups. While bumblebee richness benefited from increases in edges between managed and natural systems, other bees benefited from increases in landscape heterogeneity and hoverfly richness was fairly resistant to land-use changes. We found that for the majority of the pollinators past landscape characteristics conditioned, the more recent pollinator richness changes. Landscapes that historically had more suitable habitat were more susceptible to display hoverfly declines (caused by drivers not considered in this study). Landscapes that historically had greater spillover potential were more likely to suffer butterfly richness declines and the bumblebee assemblages were more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation. Main conclusions The diversity of responses of the pollinator groups suggest that multispecies approaches that take group-specific responses to land-use change into account are highly valuable. These findings emphasize the limited value of a one-size-fits-all biodiversity conservation measure and highlight the importance of considering landscape history when planning biodiversity conservation actions.",2015

A radical thinking is necessary for developing strategies that can co-opt natural insect-plant mutualism, ecology and environmental safety for crop protection since current agricultural practices can reduce species richness and evenness. The global environmental changes, such as increased temperature, CO (2) and ozone levels, biological invasions, land-use change and habitat fragmentation together play a significant role in re-shaping the plant-insect multi-trophic interactions. Diverse natural products need to be studied and explored for their biological functions as insect pest control agents. In order to assure the success of an integrated pest management strategy, human activities need to be harmonized to minimize the global climate changes. Plant-insect interaction is one of the most primitive and co-evolved associations, often influenced by surrounding changes. In this review, we account the persistence and evolution of plant-insect interactions, with particular focus on the effect of climate change and human interference on these interactions. Plants and insects have been maintaining their existence through a mutual service-resource relationship while defending themselves. We provide a comprehensive catalog of various defense strategies employed by the plants and/or insects. Furthermore, several important factors such as accelerated diversification, imbalance in the mutualism, and chemical arms race between plants and insects as indirect consequences of human practices are highlighted. Inappropriate implementation of several modern agricultural practices has resulted in (i) endangered mutualisms, (ii) pest status and resistance in insects and (iii) ecological instability. Moreover, altered environmental conditions eventually triggered the resetting of plant-insect interactions. Hence, multitrophic approaches that can harmonize human activities and minimize their interference in native plant-insect interactions are needed to maintain natural balance between the existence of plants and insects.",2015
Relationships among ecological traits of wild bee communities along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation,,PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE; SPECIES RICHNESS; FORAGING RANGES; DIET BREADTH; FRUIT-SET,"Amount of semi-natural habitats (permanent grasslands, woodlands and hedgerows) and their level of fragmentation are among the main determinants of wild bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. However, their impact on the distribution of bee ecological traits has received little attention. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge about how trait-based responses mediate the impact of landscapes on wild bee communities will allow better prediction and understanding of subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning.",2017
Historical changes in the importance of climate and land use as determinants of Dutch pollinator distributions,biodiversity change; climate change; ecological niche models; environmental variable importance; global warming; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; species distribution models,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; SHIFTS; BUTTERFLIES; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EXPLANATION; PREDICTIONS,"Aim Species distribution models are often used to project species distributions to different environmental conditions. However, most models do not consider whether the importance of abiotic factors may change over time. If they change, this has implications for the assessment of how abiotic changes affect species distributions. Here, we use spatially explicit historical data on species occurrences, climate and land use to test whether the importance of different climatic and land-use drivers as determinants of species distributions has remained constant over a period of >60years (1951-2014). LocationThe Netherlands. methods using species distribution models and a comprehensive country-wide dataset at 5x5km resolution, we modelled the distribution of a total of 398 pollinator species (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) for three periods (1951-1970, 1971-1990 and 1998-2014). We then evaluated whether the importance of variables related to climate (precipitation, temperature) and land use (landscape composition and habitat fragmentation) in determining pollinator distributions has changed over time. results variables related to landscape composition were highly important in determining pollinator distributions in all periods. Precipitation was generally less important than temperature, and habitat fragmentation less than landscape composition. Land-use variables remained equally important across time for all pollinator groups, except for bees where the importance of habitat fragmentation decreased significantly over time. Among climate variables, the importance of precipitation did not change across time for any pollinator group. However, the importance of temperature increased significantly in recent times for bees and hoverflies. Main conclusions determinants of species distributions can change in their importance over time when changes in the magnitude and range of environmental conditions occur. Given future temperature rises, our results imply that species distribution models calibrated with current climatic conditions may not adequately predict the future importance of environmental factors in driving species distributions.",2017

Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation.

Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how habitat suitability models (I-ISM) incorporating remote sensed vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies, providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight 'win-win' opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a 'pollinator pledge'. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more attractive city to live, work and invest in.",2017

Predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation on mangroves is problematic as pollinators may move more freely across water than terrestrial habitat, and propagules can be widely dispersed by water. Here, within each of two estuaries, we compared pollinator diversity and activity, reproductive effort and output, and rates of recruitment for sets of three large (>1500 trees), medium (300-500) and small (<50) stands. As predicted, most measures of reproductive activity and success were inversely related to stand size with large stands typically producing significantly more and larger fruit, and significantly more seedlings. Most strikingly, we found the effect of fragmentation on the abundance of pollinators (honeybees), the production and quality of fruit and the survival rate of seedlings to be similar, showing significant reduction of recruitment in small stands. This study provides the first rigorous evidence that recruitment of mangroves, like for many terrestrial plants, is negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation. From a management perspective, we argue that in the short term our data imply the importance of conserving the largest possible stands. However, additional work is needed to determine (1) the proportion of recruits within small stands that originate within large stands, (2) how seedling performance varies with fruit size and genotype, and (3) how seedling size and performance vary with the abundance and diversity of pollen.",2017

Commonly cited sources of decline are toxicants, habitat fragmentation, and parasites. Toxicant exposure can occur through uptake and distribution from plant tissues and resources such as pollen and nectar. Metals such as aluminum can be distributed to pollinators and other herbivores through this route especially in acidified or mined areas. A free-flying artificial flower patch apparatus was used to understand how two concentrations of aluminum (2 mg/L and 20 mg/L) may affect the learning, orientation, and foraging behaviors of honey bees (Apis mellifera) in Turkey. The results show that a single dose of aluminum immediately affects the floral decision making of honey bees potentially by altering sucrose perception, increasing activity level, or reducing the likelihood of foraging on safer or uncontaminated resource patches. We conclude that aluminum exposure may be detrimental to foraging behaviors and potentially to other ecologically relevant behaviors.",2017

This generally results in a degradation of habitat functioning. Fragmentation of seagrass (Zostera marina) beds has become increasingly common, and it may threaten the valuable ecosystem services they provide. Sexual reproduction through flowering and seed dispersal could contribute to the species' potential resiliency by reducing its vulnerability to fragmentation. We investigated whether the proportion and density of flowering Z. marina shoots, and subsequently the density and distribution of seeds, differed between fragmented and continuous beds. Our results revealed that while flowering effort did not differ between the two bed types, seed density was significantly reduced in fragmented versus continuous beds. Further, seed distributions were altered in fragmented beds when compared to continuous beds, both within and directly outside the bed's boundaries. Seagrass patch size positively influenced seed density, with lower seed densities in small patches. Fragmented beds consistently contained fewer seeds per-unit-area than continuous beds, regardless of bed seagrass area and flowering effort. Collectively, these results emphasize the vulnerability of Z. marina to habitat fragmentation by demonstrating a negative effect on seed density and an impact on seed distribution, which likely reduces the potential advantages of sexual reproduction for bed growth and resiliency to perturbations.",2017

Managed honeybees could spillover after the blooming of MFCs into nearby natural habitats, especially if hive numbers are associated with the cover of MFCs at the landscape scale. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has been largely overlooked despite the potential impacts of honeybees on local wildlife. We assessed this `MFC-beekeeping' association and honeybee spillover into woodland patches in 17 fragmented landscapes in SW Spain with contrasting cover of orange groves as MFC. Hive densities were almost four times greater in landscapes with high cover of orange groves and, after the orange-tree bloom, mean honeybee densities were eight times higher in woodland patches within these landscapes, as compared to landscapes with no/low cover. Seemingly, this spillover was resource-mediated since it mirrored the temporal changes in flower cover at habitat and landscape scales. Our study demonstrates for the first time a consistent spillover of managed honeybees from a MFC into nearby natural habitats.

Moreover, they also act as corridors or barriers for plant lineages and populations. High genetic diversity ensures that species are able to survive and adapt. Gene flow is one of the most important determinants of the genetic diversity and structure of out-crossed species, and it is easily affected by biotic and abiotic factors. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic diversity and structure of an alpine species, Festuca ovina L., in Xinjiang, China. A total of 100 individuals from 10 populations were analyzed using six amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs. A total of 583 clear bands were generated, of which 392 were polymorphic; thus, the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) was 67.24%. The total and average genetic diversities were 0.2722 and 0.2006 (0.1686-0.2225), respectively. The unweighted group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) tree, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and Structure analyses revealed that these populations or individuals could be clustered into two groups. The analysis of molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) suggested that most of the genetic variance existed within a population, and the genetic differentiation (Fst) among populations was 20.71%. The Shannon differentiation coefficient (G'st) among populations was 0.2350. Limited gene flow (Nm = 0.9571) was detected across all sampling sites. The Fst and Nm presented at different levels under the genetic barriers due to fragmentation. The population genetic diversity was significant relative to environmental factors such as temperature, altitude and precipitation.",2017

This account presents comprehensive information on the biology of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (P. communis Trin.; common reed) that is relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors and to the abiotic environment, plant structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and diseases, as well as history including invasive spread in other regions, and conservation. 2. Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan species native to the British flora and widespread in lowland habitats throughout, from the Shetland archipelago to southern England. It is widespread throughout Ireland and is native in the Channel Islands. Native populations occur naturally in temperate zones and on every continent except Antarctica. Some populations in Australia and North America have been introduced from elsewhere and have become naturalized, and in North America, some of these are known to be invasive where they compete with native local populations of P. australis. Typical habitats in Britain range from shallow still water along waterbody edges to marshlands, saltmarshes and drier habitat on slopes up to 470 m above sea level. Additional habitats outside Britain are springs in arid areas, riverine lowlands (-5 m above sea level) and groundwater seepage points up to 3600 m above sea level. Although it occurs on a wide range of substrates and can tolerate pH from 2.5 to 9.8, in Britain it prefers pH >4.5 and elsewhere it thrives in mildly acidic to mildly basic conditions (pH 5.5-7.5). The species plays a pivotal role in the successional transition from open water to woodland. 3. Phragmites australis is a tall, helophytic, wind-pollinated grass with annual shoots up to 5 m above-ground level from an extensive system of rhizomes and stolons. A single silky inflorescence develops at the end of each fertile stem and produces 500-2000 seeds. The plant is highly variable genetically and morphologically. 4. Expansion of established populations is mainly through clonal growth of the horizontal rhizome system and ground-surface stolons, while new populations can establish from rhizomes, stem fragments and seeds. Shoots generally emerge in spring, with timing determined primarily by physiology that is mediated by external conditions (e.g. local climate including frost).",2017
Effects of forest height and vertical complexity on abundance and biodiversity of bats in Amazonia,Chiroptera; Amazon; Forest fragmentation; Community ecology; Bat population responses; Ecosystem services,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; PHYLLOSTOMID BATS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; INSECTIVOROUS BATS; SOUTHERN AMAZONIA; UNFLOODED FORESTS; ATLANTIC FOREST; AIRBORNE LIDAR,"Anthropogenic activities have accelerated habitat change, loss, and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity over large portions of the tropics. The resulting anthropogenically created landscape mosaics often include forests of different successional stages or that have experienced different levels of anthropogenic use, which affect the physical structure of the forest (e.g., forest height, vertical complexity of vegetation). These physical characteristics of forests may affect the abundance and biodiversity of forest inhabitants, and obscure effects of landscape changes (e.g., percent forest cover) on animal species. Because bats are ecologically diverse and include seed dispersers, pollinators, and top predators, they contribute to the structure and function of forests, and directly affect forest integrity and regeneration. Thus, understanding how variation in the vegetative structure of forests affects the abundance and biodiversity of bats may provide important information to effectively manage and conserve forest fragments. We surveyed bats at 24 sites in the southern Brazilian Amazon, and quantified vegetation structure (density, height, and basal area of trees, density of understory, and canopy openness). Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we tested simple relationships of each structural characteristic with community- (taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity), guild-, and population-level attributes of bats. Models for total abundance, taxonomic biodiversity (species diversity and dominance), and phylogenetic diversity were significant, increasing with tree height and basal area, and decreasing with canopy openness. At the population level, abundances of frugivores (Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Artibeus planirostris, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Uroderma bilobatum) and nectarivores (Lonchopylla thomasi, Glossophaga soricina) were related significantly to vegetation structure. Abundances of some understory frugivores exhibited negative relationships with tree height, choosing younger forests, whereas abundances of canopy frugivores were highest in closed canopy forests. Of the nectarivores, L. thomasi was more abundant in older forests (negative relationship with density of trees), whereas G. soricina was more abundant in areas with low canopies and low basal area (i.e., earlier successional forest). Consequently, effective management of forest fragments should include consideration of local forest age and vegetation structure, as well as forest connectivity and patch size. In general, protecting areas with large trees and closed canopies enhances the persistence of pollinators and seed dispersers.   ",2017
"Pleistocene climate changes shaped the population structure of Partamona seridoensis (Apidae, Meliponini), an endemic stingless bee from the Neotropical dry forest",,BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; SEX DETERMINATION; SOUTH-AMERICA; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY,"Partamona seridoensis is an endemic stingless bee from the Caatinga, a Neotropical dry forest in northeastern Brazil. Like other stingless bees, this species plays an important ecological role as a pollinator. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure and evolutionary history of P. seridoensis across its current geographic range. Workers from 84 nests from 17 localities were analyzed for COI and Cytb genic regions. The population structure tests (Bayesian phylogenetic inference, AMOVA and haplotype network) consistently characterized two haplogroups (northwestern and eastern), with little gene flow between them, generating a high differentiation between them as well as among the populations within each haplogroup. The Mantel test revealed no isolation by distance. No evidence of a potential geographic barrier in the present that could explain the diversification between the P. seridoensis haplogroups was found. However, Pleistocene climatic changes may explain this differentiation, since the initial time for the P. seridoensis lineages diversification took place during the mid-Pleistocene, specifically the interglacial period, when the biota is presumed to have been more associated with dry conditions and had more restricted, fragmented geographical distribution. This event may have driven diversification by isolating the two haplogroups. Otherwise, the climatic changes in the late Pleistocene must not have drastically affected the population dynamics of P. seridoensis, since the Bayesian Skyline Plot did not reveal any substantial fluctuation in effective population size in either haplogroup. Considering its importance and the fact that it is an endemic bee from a very threatened Neotropical dry forest, the results herein could be useful to the development of conservation strategies for P. seridoensis.",2017

Current data underline the fragility of pollinator populations, mainly bees, which are threatened by increasing habitat fragmentation and use of agrochemicals. In this scenario, traditional communities in rural areas represent an important source of information, acquired upon direct observation of the biology and the ecology of animal species in these regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the local environmental knowledge of students in elementary schools in rural areas about bees and pollination at two moments, before and after the use of specific educational activities. Initially 110 students were interviewed and they mentioned a relatively low number of ethnospecies. After the educational activities, we noticed a marked increase in this number, besides the significant learning of important concepts. Rural school communities lack information about pollination and insect pollinators and the insects, pollinators or not, still constitute animals of negative reputation for people. We believe that a deeper knowledge of pollination and pollinators may improve sustainable activities in the region.",2017
Parent-parent and parent-offspring distances in Spondias radlkoferi seeds suggest long-distance pollen and seed dispersal: evidence from latrines of the spider monkey,Ateles; forest fragmentation; Lacandona; parental analysis; pollen dispersal; seed dispersal effectiveness,RAIN-FOREST; ATELES-GEOFFROYI; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; TROPICAL TREES; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; ANIMALS; RELATEDNESS; RECRUITMENT; POLLINATION,"Pollen and seed dispersal are key ecological processes, directly impacting the spatial distribution, abundance and genetic structure of plant populations; yet, pollen- and seed-dispersal distances are poorly known. We used molecular markers to identify the parental origin (n = 152 adult trees) of 177 Spondias radlkoferi (Anacardiaceae) seeds deposited by the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) in latrines located beneath 17 sleeping-trees in two continuous forest sites (CF) and two forest fragments (FF) in the Lacandona rain forest, Mexico. We estimated mean parent-offspring (PO) distances per latrine and, for those seeds (54% of seeds) with more than one candidate parent (i.e. the potential maternal and parental parents), we also estimated parent-parent (PP) distances per latrine, and tested if PO and PP distances differed between forest types. Global PO and PP distances per latrine averaged 682 m (range = 83-1741 m) and 610 m (range = 74-2339 m), respectively, and did not differ significantly between CF and FF. This suggests that pollen dispersal is extensive in both forest types and that long seed dispersal distances (>100 m) are common, thus supporting the hypothesis that the spider monkey is an effective seed disperser of S. radlkoferi in continuous and fragmented forests.",2017
Extended dispersal kernels in a changing world: insights from statistics of extremes,block maxima; extreme value analyses; generalized extreme value distribution; generalized Pareto distribution; long-distance dispersal; maximal dispersal distance; peak over a threshold; seed rain; seed shadow,LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; SEED DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DNA MICROSATELLITES; POPULATION; PATTERNS; LANDSCAPES; ECOLOGY; POLLEN; IDENTIFICATION,"1. Dispersal ecology is a topical discipline that involves understanding and predicting plant community responses to multiple drivers of global change. Propagule movements that entail long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are crucial for plants to reach and colonize suitable sites across fragmented landscapes. Yet, LDD events are extremely rare, and thus, obtaining reliable estimates of the maximum distances that propagules move across and of their frequency has been a long-lasting challenge in plant ecology. Recent advances in dispersal ecology have provided reliable records of dispersal distances, but they remain confined to focal populations, limiting our ability to infer the frequency and actual extent of LDD events across landscapes. 2. In this study, we view LDD events as extreme values of a dispersal function, and we apply statistics of extremes to derive the frequency and extent of LDD events of simulated and empirical data sets. We first briefly explain the rationale behind statistics of extremes, and we then illustrate how dispersal ecology can benefit conceptually and analytically from applying extreme value analyses. We apply the block maxima approach to simulated seed shadows, and we apply the peak over a threshold method to empirical data sets that contain pollen and seed dispersal distances recorded for a population of Prunus mahaleb, an insect-pollinated and vertebrate-dispersed tree species. 3. Diagnostic plots reveal a distance threshold of upsilon = 80 m for pollen grains and of upsilon = 170 m for dispersed seeds. Values that exceed the threshold fit a light-tailed distribution function for pollen and fit a fat-tailed Pareto distribution for seed dispersal distances. Both distribution functions estimate a low (but nonzero) conditional probability of reaching distant locations, extending well beyond the borders of our focal population as follows: Pr (X >= 1 km) = 9 x 10(-5) for pollen grains and Pr (X >= 10 km) = 7 x 10(-5) for dispersed seeds. 4. Synthesis. Dispersal ecologists can take the most of their dispersal distance records by applying statistics of extremes to infer the probability of occurrence of extremely rare, but crucial, long distance dispersal events that reach locations well beyond focal populations.",2017
Landscape genetic approaches to guide native plant restoration in the Mojave Desert,drylands; ecological restoration; genome scan; landscape genetics; local adaptation; Mojave Desert; multivariate analysis; seed provenance strategy; seed transfer zones; spatial genetics,CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ENCELIA-FARINOSA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENOME-SCAN; CONCEPTUAL ISSUES; TREE POPULATIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; TRADE-OFFS,"Restoring dryland ecosystems is a global challenge due to synergistic drivers of disturbance coupled with unpredictable environmental conditions. Dryland plant species have evolved complex life-history strategies to cope with fluctuating resources and climatic extremes. Although rarely quantified, local adaptation is likely widespread among these species and potentially influences restoration outcomes. The common practice of reintroducing propagules to restore dryland ecosystems, often across large spatial scales, compels evaluation of adaptive divergence within these species. Such evaluations are critical to understanding the consequences of large-scale manipulation of gene flow and to predicting success of restoration efforts. However, genetic information for species of interest can be difficult and expensive to obtain through traditional common garden experiments. Recent advances in landscape genetics offer marker-based approaches for identifying environmental drivers of adaptive genetic variability in non-model species, but tools are still needed to link these approaches with practical aspects of ecological restoration. Here, we combine spatially explicit landscape genetics models with flexible visualization tools to demonstrate how cost-effective evaluations of adaptive genetic divergence can facilitate implementation of different seed sourcing strategies in ecological restoration. We apply these methods to Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers genotyped in two Mojave Desert shrub species of high restoration importance: the long-lived, wind-pollinated gymnosperm Ephedra nevadensis, and the short-lived, insect-pollinated angiosperm Sphaeralcea ambigua. Mean annual temperature was identified as an important driver of adaptive genetic divergence for both species. Ephedra showed stronger adaptive divergence with respect to precipitation variability, while temperature variability and precipitation averages explained a larger fraction of adaptive divergence in Sphaeralcea. We describe multivariate statistical approaches for interpolating spatial patterns of adaptive divergence while accounting for potential bias due to neutral genetic structure. Through a spatial bootstrapping procedure, we also visualize patterns in the magnitude of model uncertainty. Finally, we introduce an interactive, distance-based mapping approach that explicitly links marker-based models of adaptive divergence with local or admixture seed sourcing strategies, promoting effective native plant restoration.",2017
Effects of habitat composition and landscape structure on worker foraging distances of five bumble bee species,agri-environment; Bombus; foraging range; landscape scale; pollination; spatial ecology; wild colonies,MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; NEST DENSITY; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; CONSERVATION GENETICS; BOMBUS; SCALE; DIVERSITY; RANGE,"Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km(2) agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.",2016
Effects of climate change and habitat loss on a forest-dependent bee species in a tropical fragmented landscape,Atlantic Forest; climate change; conservation; deforestation; ecological niche model; Euglossini; orchid bees,FAUNA HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; ORCHID-BEE; EUGLOSSINE BEES; EASTERN BRAZIL; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SOUTHERN BAHIA; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; GEOGRAPHIC RECORDS; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES,"1. Climate change and deforestation are suggested to be the main drivers of decline in pollinators. Forest-dependent species are expected to be the most affected and Euglossa marianae Nemesio (Hymenoptera: Apidae), an endemic species of the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF), is believed to be declining as a consequence of human impact. 2. Over the last 17 years, we carried out field surveys to unveil its distribution, allowing us to investigate the potential effects of global climate change on this species, from the last glacial maximum into the future, using species distribution models. Our main goals were to: (i) identify populations potentially under risk of extinction given future climate change; (ii) quantify the amount of climatically suitable and climatically stable areas for E. marianae within AF; (iii) evaluate the area that are available as natural habitat and under legal protection, in an attempt to indicate priority areas to preserve this species. 3. The most stable areas for maintaining populations of E. marianae were located in southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo states, a region severely affected by deforestation and with several protected areas. Climate change per se does not seem to be the major problem for E. marianae. It may constitute an indirect problem given the limited dispersal abilities of this species, however. 4. Climatically suitable areas will probably increase southwards in the future, but the extreme fragmentation of AF adds great uncertainty as to whether the species will disperse southwards, to regions such as the 'Serra do Mar' in northeastern Sao Paulo.",2016
The Multiple Impacts of Tropical Forest Fragmentation on Arthropod Biodiversity and on their Patterns of Interactions with Host Plants,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; HELICONIA-LATISPATHA; POLLINATION NETWORKS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; HISPINE BEETLES; LEAF; CONSERVATION; MEXICO; CHRYSOMELIDAE; ARCHITECTURE,"Tropical rain forest fragmentation affects biotic interactions in distinct ways. Little is known, however, about how fragmentation affects animal trophic guilds and their patterns of interactions with host plants. In this study, we analyzed changes in biotic interactions in forest fragments by using a multitrophic approach. For this, we classified arthropods associated with Heliconia aurantiaca herbs into broad trophic guilds (omnivores, herbivores and predators) and assessed the topological structure of intrapopulation plant-arthropod networks in fragments and continuous forests. Habitat type influenced arthropod species abundance, diversity and composition with greater abundance in fragments but greater diversity in continuous forest. According to trophic guilds, coleopteran herbivores were more abundant in continuous forest and overall omnivores in fragments. Continuous forest showed a greater diversity of interactions than fragments. Only in fragments, however, did the arthropod community associated with H aurantiaca show a nested structure, suggesting novel and/or opportunistic host-arthropod associations. Plants, omnivores and predators contributed more to nestedness than herbivores. Therefore, Heliconia-arthropod network properties do not appear to be maintained in fragments mainly caused by the decrease of herbivores. Our study contributes to the understanding of the impact of fragmentation on the structure and dynamics of multitrophic arthropod communities associated with a particular plant species of the highly biodiverse tropical forests. Nevertheless, further replication of study sites is needed to strengthen the conclusion that forest fragmentation negatively affects arthropod assemblages.",2016
BIRDS IN ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS: INSIGHTS FROM BIRD-PLANT MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS,frugivory; interaction diversity; modularity; nesedncss; pollination; seed dispersal; specialisation,SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; FLESHY-FRUITED TREES; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GLOBAL CHANGE; RESOURCE USE; RAIN-FOREST,"Research in ecological networks has developed impressively in recent years. A significant part of this growth has been achieved using networks to represent the complexity of mutualistic interactions between species of birds and plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bird-plant networks are built from matrices whose cells account for the field-sampled magnitudes of interaction (e.g. the number of plant fruits consumed by birds) in bird-plant species pairs. The comparative study of mutualistic networks evidences three general patterns in network structure: they are highly heterogeneous (many species having just a few interactions, but a few species being highly connected), nested (with specialists interacting with subsets of species with which generalists interact) and composed of weak and asymmetric relationships between birds and plants. This type of structure emerges from a set of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms accounting for the probabilistic role of species abundances and the deterministic role of species traits, often constrained by species phylogenies. Although bearing structural generalities, bird-plant networks are variable in space and time at very different scales: from habitat to latitudinal and biogeographical gradients, and from seasonal to inter-annual contrasts. They are also highly sensitive to human impact, being especially affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, defaunation and biological invasions. Further research on bird-plant mutualistic networks should: 1) apply wide conceptual frameworks which integrate the mechanisms of interaction and the responses of species to environmental gradients, 2) enlarge the ecological scale of networks across interaction types and animal groups, and 3) account for the ultimate functional (i.e. demographic) effects of trophic interactions.",2016

In many places,forest landscapes consist of patches of different quality,age,size and isolation,embedded in a more or less intensively managed agricultural matrix. As potential biodiversity islets,small forest patches (SFP) may deliver several crucial ecosystem services to human society,but they receive little attention compared to large,relatively intact forest patches. Beyond their role as a biodiversity reservoir,SFP provide important in situ services such as timber and wild food (game,edible plants and mushrooms) production. At the landscape scale,SFP may enhance the crop production via physical (obstacle against wind and floods) and biological (sources of pollinators and natural enemies) regulation,but may,on the other hand,also be involved in the spread of infectious diseases. Depending on their geographic location,SFP can also greatly influence the water cycle and contribute to supply high-quality water to agriculture and people. Globally,SFP are important carbon sinks and are involved in nutrient cycles,thus play a role in climate change mitigation. Cultural services are more related to landscape values than to SFP per se,but the latter may contribute to the construction of community identity. We conclude that SFP,as local biodiversity hotspots in degraded landscapes,have the potential to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and may even be crucial for the ecological intensification of agro-ecosystems. There is thus an urgent need to increase our knowledge about the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem services delivered by these SFP in agricultural landscapes.",2016
"The emblematic ""Captaincookia"" in New Caledonia (Rubiaceae), a divergent Ixora species showing adaptive variability from humid to sclerophyll forests",Adaptation; ecology; floral anatomy; genetics; Ixora; forest; morphology; New Caledonia; Rubiaceae,SECONDARY POLLEN PRESENTATION,"Background and aims - Ixora margaretae, endemic to New Caledonia, is a flagship for the archipelago's sclerophyllous forests. Recently, three populations of an Ixora resembling I. margaretae were found in humid forest. Methods - Genetic studies using SSR markers and morpho-anatomical studies of vegetative and reproductive features are provided. Results - Molecular results show that the genetic distances between and within Ixora margaretae dry and humid stands vary similarly. Accordingly, humid stands are interpreted as a part of the broad newly delimited I. margaretae, occurring in fragmented habitats. Morpho-anatomical data show that several features, such as the bark types, the individual height, and the fruit fleshiness result from genetic variability expressed under environmental constraints. However, other features are interpreted as acclimatisation of populations to local conditions, such as the convergent erected receptaculum pollinis for dry and humid stands, obtain by two different anatomical processes. All data suggest that I. margaretae is a species showing genetic isolation and relative adaptations to environments of populations in both humid and sclerophyll forests. This illustrates potential ongoing speciation processes for several populations in both forest types. A scenario showing the successive habitat modifications from humid to sclerophyll forests that can explain the persistence of the species in sclerophyll areas is proposed.",2016

Pollination may be particularly susceptible to fragmentation, as it depends on frequent pollinator movement. Unfortunately, most pollinators are too small to track efficiently which has precluded testing the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation reduces or eliminates pollen flow by disrupting pollinator movement. We used radio-telemetry to examine space use of the green hermit hummingbird (Phaethornis guy), an important 'hub' pollinator of understory flowering plants across substantial portions of the neotropics and the primary pollinator of a keystone plant which shows reduced pollination success in fragmented landscapes. We found that green hermits strongly avoided crossing large stretches of non-forested matrix and preferred to move along stream corridors. Forest gaps as small as 50 m diminished the odds of movement by 50%. Green hermits occurred almost exclusively inside the forest, with the odds of occurrence being 8 times higher at points with >95% canopy cover compared with points having <5% canopy cover. Nevertheless, surprisingly. the species occurred in fragmented landscapes with low amounts of forest (similar to 30% within a 2 km radius). Our results indicate that although green hermits are present even in landscapes with low amounts of tropical forest, movement within these landscapes ends up strongly constrained by forest gaps. Restricted movement of pollinators may be an underappreciated mechanism for widespread declines in pollination and plant fitness in fragmented landscapes, even when in the presence of appropriate pollinators.",2016

This process is usually studied to determine how various forces extirpate species, such as catastrophic disturbance, species invasions, habitat fragmentation, or unnatural/anthropogenic stressors. However, in ephemeral ecosystems, community disassembly is a natural and repeatable process. While many ephemeral ecosystems are aquatic (vernal pools, playa lakes, rock pools, saline lakes, phytotelmata, etc.), some disassembly patterns are applicable to other ecosystem types, including terrestrial ecosystems. As ephemeral waterbodies near the end of their hydroperiod, certain aspects fundamentally change. These fundamental changes or mechanisms cause visible patterns of community disassembly. Decreasing habitat size eliminates microhabitats and increases encounter rates between organisms, possibly increasing predation and competition. A harshening habitat eliminates low-tolerance species, changes the proportions of specialists/generalists, and forces organisms to acclimate, emigrate, or die. Additionally, ultraviolet light affects more of the water column, eliminating unprotected species. Furthermore, the entire metacommunity is often in similar stages of disassembly and collapses. Many of these mechanisms drive disassembly of terrestrial ephemeral habitats, such as animal carcasses, dung pads, or fungal fruiting bodies. Organisms obligate to ephemeral habitats have evolved to optimize their life history for a rapid life cycle with specific adaptations for themselves or their offspring to survive through the inactive period of the ecosystem. While some disassembly may occur too fast for biotic interactions or compensatory dynamics to be important, organisms undergoing natural disassembly should expect it. Thus, predictions of disassembly based on internal or biotic patterns may be more common in natural disassembly scenarios than in human-induced disassembly of permanent ecosystems. Additionally, natural community disassembly should be more predictable and understandable than a permanent community's reaction to a never-before-seen anthropogenic disturbance. Community disassembly is an important ecological component of ephemeral ecosystems. The processes that occur during disassembly shape assemblages over ecologically and evolutionary relevant timescales. Understanding how natural disassembly can feed back to ultimately drive ecosystem structure and function increases our knowledge of fundamental ecology and provides for a new frontier of study.",2016

Gene movements leading to successful establishment of external gametes (i.e. effective gene flow) into fragmented populations can solely be assessed by investigating the origin of natural regeneration. This study is focused on studying gene flow patterns in two silver fir stands in Central Apennines, where the species has a highly fragmented distribution. By using nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers, we investigated genetic variation, fine-scale spatial genetic structure, effective gene flow rates and large-scale connectivity characterizing both stands. Similar levels of genetic variation and low genetic differentiation between stands (F-ST = 0.005) and across generations were found, coupled with low inbreeding and weak to absent SGS in the adult cohort (Sp < 0.003). On the other hand, substantial differences between the two stands in terms of gene flow rates were observed. Irrespective of the parentage approach used, higher gene flow rates were found in the stand located at the upper silver fir altitudinal limit, especially for seed-mediated gene flow (0.79 in the upper stand vs. 0.48 in the lower stand). Conversely, the lower stand was characterized by a higher reproductive dominance of local adults. Our findings suggest that, despite similar levels of genetic variation and generally high gene flow rates, different processes may be acting on the two stands, reflecting varying ecological conditions.",2016

Metrics for describing the undulating shape of continuous habitat surfaces can expand the usefulness of continuous gradient surfaces that describe habitat and predict the flow of organisms and genes. We adopted a landscape gradient model of habitat and used surface metrics of connectivity to model the genetic continuity between populations of the banded longhorn beetle [Typocerus v. velutinus (Olivier)] collected at 17 sites across a fragmentation gradient in Indiana, USA. We tested the hypothesis that greater habitat connectivity facilitates gene flow between beetle populations against a null model of isolation by distance (IBD). We used next-generation sequencing to develop 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and genotype the individual beetles to assess the population genetic structure. Isolation by distance did not explain the population genetic structure. The surface metrics model of habitat connectivity explained the variance in genetic dissimilarities 30 times better than the IBD model. We conclude that surface metrology of habitat maps is a powerful extension of landscape genetics in heterogeneous landscapes.",2016

MART. MELIACEAE; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; POLLEN DISPERSAL; NEOTROPICAL TREE; ARAUCARIA-ANGUSTIFOLIA; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; 2-GENERATION ANALYSIS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CONTEMPORARY POLLEN; LANDSCAPE GENETICS,"The Atlantic forest is the biome most severely affected by deforestation in Brazil. Cabralea canjerana spp. canjerana is a dioecious tree species with widespread distribution in the Neotropical region. This species is considered a model to ascertain population ecology parameters for endangered plant species from the Atlantic forest. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure and pollen-mediated gene flow are crucial information in landscape genetics and evolutionary ecology. A total of 192 adults and 121 offspring were sampled in seven C. canjerana populations in the Southern Minas Gerais State, Brazil, to assess whether pollen-mediated gene flow is able to prevent spatial genetic structure within and among Atlantic forest fragments. Several molecular ecology parameters were estimated using microsatellite loci. High levels of genetic diversity (H-E = 0.732) and moderate population structure (theta = 0.133) were recorded. No significant association between kinship and spatial distance amongst individuals within each population (Sp = 0.000109) was detected. Current pollen-mediated gene flow occurs mainly within forest fragments, probably due to short-distance flights of the pollinator of C. canjerana, and also the forest fragmentation may have restricted flight distance. The high levels of genetic differentiation found amongst the seven sites sampled demonstrated how habitat fragmentation affects the gene flow process in natural areas.",2016

Some have sought to determine how deforestation plays a role in mediating impacts between the AHB and native pollinators. We present the largest-ever, systematic survey of AHB presence/absence in the Neotropics to test to what extent the AHB prefers to forage within forests vs. outside forests. AHB presence/absence within and outside forest fragments was recorded at 187 locations distributed across the state of Rondonia, Brazil. The landscapes at each location varied in terms of overall level of deforestation and the length of time since modern human settlement. AHB presence was significantly higher outside forest cover. These findings agree with previous studies documenting the spread of AHBs in the Amazon in their preference for deforested areas.",2016
Reproductive isolation between populations of Iris atropurpurea is associated with ecological differentiation,Adaptive divergence; aster modelling; Iris atropurpurea Baker; Iris section Oncocyclus; isolation by distance; isolation by ecology; local adaptation; post-zygotic reproductive barriers,SHELTERING MALE BEES; GENETIC RESCUE; ONCOCYCLUS-IRISES; OUTBREEDING DEPRESSION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; MONKEYFLOWERS MIMULUS; FLOWERING PLANTS; SPECIATION; CONSERVATION; DISTANCE,"Background and Aims Speciation is often described as a continuous dynamic process, expressed by different magnitudes of reproductive isolation (RI) among groups in different levels of divergence. Studying intraspecific partial RI can shed light on mechanisms underlying processes of population divergence. Intraspecific divergence can be driven by spatially stochastic accumulation of genetic differences following reduced gene flow, resulting in increased RI with increased geographical distance, or by local adaptation, resulting in increased RI with environmental difference. Methods We tested for RI as a function of both geographical distance and ecological differentiation in Iris atropurpurea, an endemic Israeli coastal plant. We crossed plants in the Netanya Iris Reserve population with plants from 14 populations across the species' full distribution, and calculated RI and reproductive success based on fruit set, seed set and fraction of seed viability. Key Results We found that total RI was not significantly associated with geographical distance, but significantly increased with ecological distance. Similarly, reproductive success of the crosses, estimated while controlling for the dependency of each component on the previous stage, significantly reduced with increased ecological distance. Conclusions Our results indicate that the rise of post-pollination reproductive barriers in I. atropurpurea is more affected by ecological differentiation between populations than by geographical distance, supporting the hypothesis that ecological differentiation is predominant over isolation by distance and by reduced gene flow in this species. These findings also affect conservation management, such as genetic rescue, in the highly fragmented and endangered I. atropurpurea.",2016

We collected 11 populations from fragmented and conserved forest. We assess genetic variation of C. alternans, genetic exchange, differentiation, bottlenecks, effective population size and signals of natural selection. Genetic diversity was higher in conserved than in fragmented forest but not significant. Fragmentation did not play a significant role in genetic diversity, possibly due to the populations heterogeneity. C. alternans has been subject to a pronounced isolation of trees as a product of logging, thus raising inbreeding. Bayesian clustering show a trend towards an increased structuring over the course of generations but also, indicates that populations have recently gone through a bottleneck. The bottleneck following deforestation was not severe enough to lower the effective size, this could lead to high standing genetic diversity, providing a buffer against genetic erosion. We observed directional and balancing selection in C. alternans. Maintenance of variability and increased differentiation signify that their populations have been subject to a differential selective pressure at the ecological and the landscape level, combined effect could lead to disturb pollination and dispersion processes, modifying in the long term the effective population size.

Determinants of functional connectivity of holm oak woodlands: Fragment size and mouse foraging behavior,Quercus ilex; Mating network; Seed dispersal; Pollen dispersal; Forest fragmentation,POLLEN DISPERSAL CURVE; QUERCUS-ILEX; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MATING PATTERNS; FOREST FRAGMENTATION; CONTEMPORARY POLLEN; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; TREE POPULATIONS; FAGACEAE,"Demographic and genetic connectivity of fragmented plant populations will depend on effective propagule flow across the landscape. We analyze functional connectivity in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) fragmented landscape by considering three important stages driving recruitment: effective pollination, acorn production and acorn dispersal. We used a network approach to (1) determine if pollen-mediated gene exchange across the landscape was spatially structured; (2) estimate the effects of limited acorn dispersal on functional connectivity; (3) identify which landscape traits could drive source sink dynamics of gene flow. Although long distance dispersal was relatively frequent, most effective pollen flow occurred over short distances (<100 m). This resulted in a significantly modular structure of the mating network, yielding higher gene flow among nearby fragments. Limited mouse acorn hoarding activity had a strong impact on landscape connectivity, decreasing male gametic immigration rates into forest patches by one order of magnitude Besides, our results show that big forest fragments (>10 ha) are the main pollen sources, while small ones (<1 ha) are important pollen sinks. Thus, big fragments are critical to maintain functional connectivity, while small forest fragments may provide acorn crops better representing regional genetic diversity. In addition to area effects, less isolated and more central fragments showed higher migration rates and exchanged effective pollen with more fragments. Hence, we expected that landscapes with uniform or clumped distribution of big forest fragments would show optimal connectivity traits. However, despite that simulated gene flow was more evenly distributed across the landscape, connectance and migration rates decreased. Our results call for caution before translating patch-level management guidelines to the landscape scale. They also show that the level of functional connectivity may change throughout the recruitment process, suggesting that large-scale conservation strategies may fail if local effective seed establishment is disregarded.

"Spatial and seasonal distribution of Bee Pollinator Species in a Sudanese Agro-ecological System in Burkina Faso, West Africa",Biodiversity; Pollination; Bees; Ecosystem service; Agriculture; Burkina Faso,ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; FOOD SECURITY; CONSERVATION; PESTICIDES; DIVERSITY; APPLE; CROPS,"Bees are the most important pollinators of many crops and wild plant species. The ecosystem service of pollination provided by these insects is crucial to maintain overall biodiversity and to secure crop yields worldwide. Especially improving the livelihood of smallholders in developing countries through higher crop yields is essential for achieving global food security and poverty reduction. However, ecosystem degradation, depletion of plant species, habitat fragmentation, use of insecticides and global warming constitute severe threats to these organisms with some being clearly at risk of extinction. Despite the great ecological and economic importance of bees as pollinators, hardly anything is known about the bee species in West Africa and particularly in Burkina Faso. The study aimed to assess bee communities of a Sudanese agro-ecological system in Burkina Faso. We investigated the diversity and abundance of bees in near-natural savannah habitats and in nearby fields of the main cash crops (cotton, sesame) at three sites in the south of the country. Bees were caught with 288 colored pantraps for the duration of one year, covering the dry and rainy season. A total of 105 species of bees belonging to 32 genera and 4 families (Apidae, Megachilidae, Halictidae, and Colletidae) were identified. The most diverse family was Halictidae (sweat bees) with 41 species. The family of Apidae (including honey bees, bumble bees and stingless bees) was the most abundant family including 92.57% of specimens collected. In this study, the stingless bee Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most abundant species with 74.55% of all specimen. However, general conclusions have to be drawn with caution, since species abundances can greatly differ from year to year. During our study time, we noticed that the greatest number of species and specimens of bees were obtained in the dry season because of the longer duration of the season. However, the peak of the diversity and abundance of bees was observed in the rainy season especially in July and August (months of intense rains). The assessment of bee species and their seasonal distribution is an important scientific basis for the establishment of appropriate management strategies and can be implied in terms of sustainable agricultural practices that insure better productivity due to bee pollination service provision and biodiversity conservation.",2016
Mating patterns and pollinator mobility are critical traits in forest fragmentation genetics,mating system; plant genetic resources; plant-pollinator mutualisms; pollen competition; pollen discounting,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLLEN DISPERSAL; EUCALYPTUS-INCRASSATA; FLOWERING PLANTS; SEED PRODUCTION; RAIN-FOREST; TREE; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS,"Most woody plants are animal-pollinated, but the global problem of habitat fragmentation is changing the pollination dynamics. Consequently, the genetic diversity and fitness of the progeny of animal-pollinated woody plants sired in fragmented landscapes tend to decline due to shifts in plant-mating patterns (for example, reduced outcrossing rate, pollen diversity). However, the magnitude of this mating-pattern shift should theoretically be a function of pollinator mobility. We first test this hypothesis by exploring the mating patterns of three ecologically divergent eucalypts sampled across a habitat fragmentation gradient in southern Australia. We demonstrate increased selfing and decreased pollen diversity with increased fragmentation for two small-insect-pollinated eucalypts, but no such relationship for the mobile-bird-pollinated eucalypt. In a meta-analysis, we then show that fragmentation generally does increase selfing rates and decrease pollen diversity, and that more mobile pollinators tended to dampen these mating-pattern shifts. Together, our findings support the premise that variation in pollinator form contributes to the diversity of mating-pattern responses to habitat fragmentation.",2015
"Pronounced Seasonal Changes in the Movement Ecology of a Highly Gregarious Central-Place Forager, the African Straw-Coloured Fruit Bat (Eidolon helvum)",,HEADED FLYING-FOX; PTEROPUS-POLIOCEPHALUS; UTILIZATION DISTRIBUTIONS; SEED DISPERSAL; HOME RANGES; WEST-AFRICA; PTEROPODIDAE; ANIMALS; HENIPAVIRUS; CHIROPTERA,"Background Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) migrate over vast distances across the African continent, probably following seasonal bursts of resource availability. This causes enormous fluctuations in population size, which in turn may influence the bats' impact on local ecosystems. We studied the movement ecology of this central-place forager with state-of-the-art GPS/acceleration loggers and concurrently monitored the seasonal fluctuation of the colony in Accra, Ghana. Habitat use on the landscape scale was assessed with remote sensing data as well as ground-truthing of foraging areas. Principal Findings During the wet season population low (similar to 4000 individuals), bats foraged locally (3.5-36.7 km) in urban areas with low tree cover. Major food sources during this period were fruits of introduced trees. Foraging distances almost tripled (24.1-87.9 km) during the dry season population peak (similar to 150,000 individuals), but this was not compensated for by reduced resting periods. Dry season foraging areas were random with regard to urban footprint and tree cover, and food consisted almost exclusively of nectar and pollen of native trees. Conclusions and Significance Our study suggests that straw-coloured fruit bats disperse seeds in the range of hundreds of meters up to dozens of kilometres, and pollinate trees for up to 88 km. Straw-coloured fruit bats forage over much larger distances compared to most other Old World fruit bats, thus providing vital ecosystem services across extensive landscapes. We recommend increased efforts aimed at maintaining E. helvum populations throughout Africa since their keystone role in various ecosystems is likely to increase due to the escalating loss of other seed dispersers as well as continued urbanization and habitat fragmentation.",2015

The challenge stems from the multiple interdependent ways that landscapes change following fragmentation and the ensuing complex impacts on populations and communities of interacting species. We confronted these challenges by evaluating how fragmentation affects individual plants through interactions with animals, across five herbaceous species native to longleaf pine savannas. We created a replicated landscape experiment that provides controlled tests of three major fragmentation effects (patch isolation, patch shape [i.e., edge-to-area ratio], and distance to edge), established experimental founder populations of the five species to control for spatial distributions and densities of individual plants, and employed structural equation modeling to evaluate the effects of fragmentation on plant reproductive output and the degree to which these impacts are mediated through altered herbivory, pollination, or pre-dispersal seed predation. Across species, the most consistent response to fragmentation was a reduction in herbivory. Herbivory, however, had little impact on plant reproductive output, and thus we found little evidence for any resulting benefit to plants in fragments. In contrast, fragmentation rarely impacted pollination or pre-dispersal seed predation, but both of these interactions had strong and consistent impacts on plant reproductive output. As a result, our models robustly predicted plant reproductive output (r(2) = 0.52-0.70), yet due to the weak effects of fragmentation on pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation, coupled with the weak effect of herbivory on plant reproduction, the effects of fragmentation on reproductive output were generally small in magnitude and inconsistent. This work provides mechanistic insight into landscape-scale variation in plant reproductive success, the relative importance of plant-animal interactions for structuring these dynamics, and the nuanced nature of how habitat fragmentation can affect populations and communities of interacting species.",2015
Reduced fecundity and genetic diversity in small populations of rewarding versus deceptive orchid species: a meta-analysis,Deceptive orchids; fruit set; genetic variation; genetic differentiation; habitat fragmentation; pollination system,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; POLLINATOR LIMITATION; PUBLICATION BIAS; SEED SET; CONSEQUENCES; SIZE; EVOLUTION; FITNESS; DEGRADATION,"Background and aims - Understanding how plant traits mediate the relationship between plant population size, fitness and genetic diversity is fundamental to conservation. Many orchid species are threatened, possibly due to their susceptibility to the consequences of habitat fragmentation and the associated decreasing population size. One third of all orchids do not produce nectar to entice pollinators, and this is believed to promote gene flow and outcrossing. Therefore, we hypothesised that deceptive orchids are less susceptible to reductions in population size than rewarding species. Methods - We reviewed the available literature and used traditional and phylogenetically independent meta-analyses to explore relationships between population size, fitness (fruit set) and genetic diversity. Key results - Results showed that orchids in general are highly susceptible to the consequences of small population size. Fruit set significantly decreased in small populations of rewarding, but not in deceptive species. Deceptive orchids were, however, as likely to lose genetic diversity in small populations, even though significantly less genetic differentiation (Fst) was present between populations of deceptive orchids. Finally, we found that homozygosity did not relate with population size, which may indicate a selection process against less fit homozygotes in small orchid populations. Conclusions - We conclude that reductions in population size most likely resulting from habitat loss and fragmentation represent major threats to the population viability of orchids. Fitness of rewarding orchids declines through ecological mechanisms, whereas deceptive orchids may be more susceptible to genetic loss as they are more susceptible to decreased gene flow.",2015

The threatened lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata), considered to be an obligate deep-forest species, is one of only 2 extant land mammals endemic to New Zealand; it plays a number of important roles within native forests, including pollination and seed dispersal, and rarely occurs in modified forests. We used radiotelemetry to study the movements, roosting behavior, and habitat use of M. tuberculata within a fragmented landscape comprised of 3 main habitat types: open space (harvested forest and pastoral land), native forests, and exotic pine plantations. We found that the bats had smaller home-range areas and travelled shorter nightly distances than populations investigated previously from contiguous native forest. Furthermore, M. tuberculata occupied all 3 habitat types, with native forest being preferred overall. However, individual variation in habitat selection was high, with some bats preferring exotic plantation and open space over native forest. Roosting patterns were similar to those previously observed in contiguous forest; individual bats often switched between communal and solitary roosts. Our findings indicate that M. tuberculata exhibit some degree of behavioral plasticity that allows them to adapt to different landscape mosaics and exploit alternative habitats. To our knowledge, this is the first such documentation of plasticity in habitat use for a bat species believed to be an obligate forest-dweller.",2015

Interspecific genetic variation was examined in all species of the series, except for C. naqabensis. Intraspecific genetic and morphological variation was considered in the three Greek endemics, C. cartwrightianus, C. hadriaticus and C. oreocreticus. Genetic variation was evaluated based on amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeats analyses, including 94 and 233 specimens, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance demonstrated significant genetic variation within populations, compared with low genetic variation between populations suggesting substantial gene flow between populations. In Neighbour-Net analysis, C. hadriaticus samples from mainland Greece were separated from Peloponnesian samples; C. cartwrightianus, C. hadriaticus and C. oreocreticus generally were grouped with C. sativus samples. Pollination and maintenance of genetic variation are discussed. The large intraspecific variation found within the three specifically studied species reflects dynamic population structures with potential to meet future ecological fluctuations. It emphasises a large gene pool which should be considered by including a larger number of accessions in genetic diversity studies.",2015
The Size But not the Symmetry of the Wings of Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier (Apidae: Euglossini) is Affected by Human-Disturbed Landscapes in the Brazilian Cerrado Savanna,Bees; biodiversity crisis; fluctuating asymmetry,FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; ATLANTIC FOREST; DEVELOPMENTAL INSTABILITY; BEES HYMENOPTERA; BODY-SIZE; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; COMMUNITY; COENAGRIONIDAE; DIVERSITY,"Among other human-related activities, habitat loss and fragmentation are currently ranked as the most important environmental features affecting the persistence of animal and plant populations in landscapes, as well as the maintenance of ecological processes and services. Since these processes are also capable of affecting the ontogenetic development of species inhabiting those landscapes, here we measured the wing veins of male Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier (Apidae: Euglossini) bees in order to evaluate whether the bees sampled in agriculture (AG) areas suffer higher fluctuating asymmetry (FA) than those sampled in Cerrado (CE) areas in the Brazilian state of Goias. We believe that individuals sampled in CE areas would be less asymmetric than those sampled in AG areas, given a potential higher exposure of these specimens to environmental stresses (mostly pesticides). However, we did not observe a significant trend in the FA measures we obtained, although three wing measures were bigger for bees from CE areas. The lack of significant effects of FA may be related to inherent bionomic features of E. nigrita. For instance, given their high individual dispersal abilities, the individuals we analyzed may have developed in different areas than those where they were sampled. Their generalist feeding behavior may also have given them a higher resistance to environmental perturbations, buffering the normal development of immatures even in areas with local high environmental stress. Nonetheless, higher death rates of individuals from anthropic areas may also have killed the developing immatures of E. nigrita before they reached adulthood consequently equalizing our sampled estimates.",2015

Two study areas were employed: a pollen donor area composed of a clonal stand of a single pollen donor clone (PD) and a pollen sink (PS) area composed of a mixed clonal stand of two other clones (PSI and PS2). In the pollen sink area four plots with 30 trees each, located at 25, 200, 400 and 550 m from the PD were established as sink islands. Before flowering, the entire clonal stands of clones PSI and PS2, with exception of the sink islands were clear cut. Seeds were harvested from five randomly sampled trees in each sink island and the paternity of 15 seedlings per tree, 75 seedlings per island totaling a sample of 300 seedlings, was determined with PD as the alleged father. The self-pollination rate in the sink islands varied from zero to 24%. Paternity assignment to the PD was highest in the island at 25 m (17.3%) and rapidly decreased to 4.0% at 200 m and 2.7% at 550 m, suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance, while revealing a large pollen contribution from unaccounted sources across all islands. Our results in a fragmented clonal site agree with previous estimates of general pollen movement in eucalypt seed orchards, showing that pollination will take place by and large at relatively short distances of less than 200 m, consistent with the expected range of flight of pollinator bees. Nevertheless the exponential distribution observed also indicates that low levels of pollination success are to be expected over longer distances. Our data provide useful guidelines regarding the distance at which seed orchards should be established away from potentially large pollen pressure of clonal stands to minimize unwanted pollen introgression. Furthermore, our results on dispersal rate and distance of pollen have direct implications on gene containment strategies and modeling studies, as pollen-mediated gene flow is one of the key determinants of the potential ecological and biosafety impacts of prospective transgenic eucalypts.

Alterations in resource availability and in mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions may impact plant offspring quantity and quality. Currently, several old fragmented systems evidence a process of flora homogenization, where shade-tolerant species are replaced by pioneer light-demanding species. Notably, the relationship between quantity and quality parameters of plant offspring production and the successful recruitment of pioneer species in fragmented forests has been poorly explored. Here, we assess population size, sapling recruitment and offspring performance of one of the most widespread tree species of subtropical South America, the native pioneer Acacia caven (Fabaceae). Population size of adults and saplings increased from small to continuous forests, whereas the sapling recruitment per adult tree (sapling/adult ratio) showed no significant differences among forests of different size. Seedling performance was negatively related to forest area and population size, implying potential superior competitive ability of seedlings produced in smaller populations compared to larger ones. Our results show that A.caven is resilient to habitat fragmentation effects, which may be ascribed to a set of advantageous ecological traits such as outcrossing, massive flowering, generalist pollination, drought resistance, rapid growth and re-sprouting. Thus, this pioneer tree benefits from the availability of vacant sites and resources released by declining plant populations of other species, eventually becoming the dominant species in fragmented habitats. Pioneer native plant species with ecological traits such as A.caven may represent the silent successful survivors and new colonizers of fragmented habitats, the ubiquitous landscapes of the future.",2015

Recent botanical explorations have found new but scattered populations, increasing its known geographical range. Ecological studies were conducted on six of the 29 populations found. Parameters such as size, density, population structure, and static life table are presented. This is the first study of its kind conducted to prompt the Mexican authorities to establish natural protected areas for this species and the associated biodiversity, because deforestation is rapidly diminishing the populations. The population structure in general showed a Deevey-III curve, while two populations showed Deevey-I curves. A 400 m(2) area had a population size from 143 to 378 individuals. Population density varied from 0.358 individuals/m(2) to 0.945 individuals/m(2). Population structure was statistically different among populations. The large amount of seedlings in all sites was distinctive and indicated the specie's reproductive success even in small forest fragments. This research provides the most complete information available to date regarding populations of C. fuscoviridis. Future protected areas established in the better conserved populations could enable the populations' rapid recovery.

The use of molecular markers is beneficial in the genetic study of landraces with different agro-ecological origins. In this study, genetic variation in seven selfed and unselfed C. pepo landraces from three districts in the KwaZulu-Natal Province was investigated using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Of the 36 and 55 primers tested, 9 RAPD and 10 SSR primers were selected for their reproducibility and high polymorphism. A total of 100 fragments were detected by RAPD, out of which 94(94%) fragments were considered polymorphic. SSR markers revealed a total of 56 alleles, where 38 (68%) alleles were polymorphic. The sizes of fragments ranged from 75 to 1800 bp and from 124 to 251 bp in RAPD and SSR markers, respectively. The number of fragments per primer ranged between 9 and 14 and between 1 and 12, in RAPD and SSR, respectively. The genetic differentiation coefficient between populations (Gsr) ranged between 0.0022 and 0.0100 with RAPD marker and between zero and 0.0076 with SSR marker. Both markers revealed overwhelming averages of gene flow: 97.78 and 132.09 in RAPD and SSR markers, respectively. Both techniques discriminated the landraces very effectively, but only the RAPD marker was able to discriminate landraces according to fruit colour change at maturity as well as their agro-ecological origins. Dendrograms of both markers depicted the close relationship between landraces originating from the Umkhanyakude district (MNS and MS landraces). All genetic parameters indicated that there was plentiful genetic diversity in C. pepo landraces of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. ",2015

Understanding how species respond to fragmentation and the scales over which functionality is retained, can be critical for managing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Allocasuarina verticillata (drooping sheoak, drooping she-oak) is a dioecious, wind-pollinated and -dispersed species with key conservation values across southeastern Australia. But vegetation clearing associated with agricultural expansion has reduced the abundance and spatial distribution of this species in many regions. Spatial genetic structure, relatedness among trees, pollen dispersal and mating patterns were examined in fragmented A. verticillata populations selected to represent the types of remnants that now characterise this species. Short scale spatial genetic structure (5-25 m) and relatedness among trees were observed in most populations. Unexpectedly, the two male trees closest to each female did not have a reproductive advantage accounting for only 4-15% of the seed produced in larger populations. Biparental inbreeding was also generally low (<4%) with limited evidence of seed crop domination by some male trees. More male trees contributed to seed crops in linear remnants (mean 17) compared to those from patch remnants (mean 11.3) which may reflect differences in pollen dispersal within the two remnant types. On average, pollen travels similar to 100 m irrespective of remnant type but was also detected to have dispersed as far as 1 km in open landscapes.

In addition, knowledge of this variation is critical for the conservation and management of endangered plant taxa. Found in the Himalayas, Podophyllum hexandrum is an endangered high-elevation plant species that has great medicinal importance. Here we report on the genetic diversity analysis of 24 P. hexandrum populations (209 individuals), representing the whole of the Indian Himalayas. In the present study, seven amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs generated 1677 fragments, of which 866 were found to be polymorphic. Neighbour joining clustering, principal coordinate analysis and STRUCTURE analysis clustered 209 individuals from 24 populations of the Indian Himalayan mountains into two major groups with a significant amount of gene flow (N-m = 2.13) and moderate genetic differentiation F-st(0.196), G(st)'(0.20). This suggests that, regardless of geographical location, all of the populations from the Indian Himalayas are intermixed and are composed broadly of two types of genetic populations. High variance partitioned within populations (80 %) suggests that most of the diversity is restricted to the within-population level. These results suggest two possibilities about the ancient population structure of P. hexandrum: either all of the populations in the geographical region of the Indian Himalayas are remnants of a once-widespread ancient population, or they originated from two types of genetic populations, which coexisted a long time ago, but subsequently separated as a result of long-distance dispersal and natural selection. High variance partitioned within the populations indicates that these populations have evolved in response to their respective environments over time, but low levels of heterozygosity suggest the presence of historical population bottlenecks.",2015

Here, using sequence datasets obtained from three chloroplast DNA fragments (trnH-psbA, trnS-trnG, and trnL-F) from 320 individuals belonging to 24 natural populations, we investigated the phylogeographical history of Tacca chantrieri, which inhabits Southeast Asian tropical forests. Although relatively high level of differentiation among the populations were observed, mismatch distribution and neutrality tests showed no evidence of recent demographic population expansion. Phylogenetic inference exhibited two identified population groups showing a disjunctive distribution of dominant haplotypes. The split in cpDNA was largely consistent with the Tanaka line and Red River geographically. Molecular clock estimations revealed that the two lineages diverged during Pleistocene approximately 1.16 Ma. Therefore, the disjunct distribution of T.chantrieri could be explained by both the vicariance caused by Red River as well as ecological barriers caused by the different monsoon climates (Southwest monsoon vs. Southeast monsoon) that developed during the Pleistocene. The Tanaka line can be considered as a climatically driven barrier that influenced present-day plant dispersal.",2015

In the tropics, the creation of these landscapes has shadowed the destruction of rainforests. Most studies of diversity across tropical countryside landscapes have focused on the taxonomic diversity of easily measured groups. Thus there are major gaps in our understanding of many ecologically important organisms in these landscapes. Here we examine the taxonomic and functional diversity of Diptera in countryside landscapes of Australia's wet tropics, focusing on some of the most common landscape elements in this region: forest remnants, forest edges, and open cattle pastures. We demonstrate that different landscape elements possess contrasting levels of dipteran diversity. Importantly, small forest fragments act as reservoirs of fly taxonomic diversity, but for some fly functional groups (pollinators and predators), small forest fragments and their edges have lower functional redundancy than larger forest patches and their edges. We also show that dipteran diversity is more positively associated with local forest cover than patch size alone. Our results complement the growing literature on ecologically important insect taxa in countryside landscapes around the world, and contribute to a greater understanding of how landscape modification likely impacts ecosystem functions and services at landscape scales.

Changes in seed-dispersing ant behavior prompted by exurban land use, such as edge avoidance, may pose deleterious impacts on the woodland plants (myrmecochores) they disperse, and hence the floristic diversity of exurban forests. We examined the effects of exurbanization on seed-dispersing ant nesting and foraging, seed retrieval, dispersal direction and subsequent impact on myrmecochores. We used a matrix of forested and exurbanized habitats to test whether (1) exurban edges decrease ant nest colonization and seed foraging, (2) ants disperse seeds away from exurban edges, and (3) consequently, there is lower ant-dispersed plant abundance nearer exurban edges. We found that exurban development poses little impact on keystone seed-dispersing ants because they foraged, colonized and thrived in fragmented woodland habitats as well as they did in intact forests. Exurban edges changed ant behavior, however, so that they generally moved seeds toward forest interiors, and, hence, away from edges. Corresponding to this behavioral change, we found that ant-dispersed plants declined with proximity to edges, whereas other woodland herbs with dispersal modes other than ants were unaffected. Exurbanization poses little threat to seed-dispersing ant viability, but, by changing foraging patterns (specifically, limiting the directionality of dispersal), it indirectly threatens the plants they disperse. Edge effects on biota commonly are associated with cascades through abiotic resources, but we show a deleterious biotic cascade between exurban edge, keystone ants and herbaceous plants. Species-mediated services, such as seed dispersal and pollination, are key resources, and assessing the full consequences of land use change therefore necessitates evaluation of impacts on biotic interactions.",2015
Survey and statistical analysis of plant reintroductions in Germany,conservation responsibility; Ellenberg indicator values; Grime strategy; habitat type; life form; red list,,"Aim - Plant reintroductions and other forms of targeted species translocations will in the future gain growing importance for nature conservation. In fragmented habitats, species reintroductions offer one of the most efficient tools for preserving or restoring plant diversity. In our study, we have compiled available data about plant reintroduction projects in Germany to answer the following questions: (1) What are the characteristics, habitat preferences and ecological strategies of species considered in plant reintroduction trials, and are these representative of the entire class of threatened species in Germany? (2) Is the judgment of the success or failure of plant reintroductions biased by the choice of species used in the experiments? (3) Do reintroduction efforts focus on those species for which Germany has a particularly high responsibility for conservation? Methods - Information about reintroduction projects in Germany were obtained from published and internet sources as well as unpublished reports. In our search we focused on single-species trials in the framework of scientific or conservation projects. For all threatened species included in our database, we compiled information on their systematics, life form, ecological strategies and habitat preferences. A list of all species being threatened nationally or regionally, comprising both reintroduced and not reintroduced species, served as a reference for statistical analysis. Results - The list of vascular plants used in conservation-oriented reintroductions consisted of 196 taxa. Species of families with large and conspicuous, mostly insect-pollinated flowers (for example, Orchidaceae) were over-represented among the reintroduced species compared to those threatened species not included in reintroduction trials. Species considered were also more often than expected found in semi-natural open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Notably, many projects focused on calcareous grasslands, characterized by dry, high-pH and infertile soils. In contrast, species of more near-natural vegetation (alpine and rocky formations, forests) were under-represented. About 25% of the species that were reintroduced are not threatened on the national scale. Out of 150 species for which Germany has a particularly high responsibility for conservation, only 14 (9.3%) were reintroduced. For only about 1/3 of all reintroduction attempts, success or failure were documented; whereas the success rate appears to be relatively low in nutrient-poor environments, trials with nutrient-demanding and competitive species were more successful. Conclusions - We conclude that conservation-oriented reintroduction attempts should focus more on species for which the country or a region has a particular high responsibility. Reintroductions, to a larger extent than at present, also need to consider the different chances of success in different habitat types and environments.",2015

It is a herbaceous species typical of hill plant communities, which, along with remnant grassland patches, are the most relevant natural habitats for the maintenance of diversity in the Southern Pampas. Eryngium regnellii is key to the maintenance of pollination mutualisms, being a generalist (displaying a diverse assemblage of pollinators) and ubiquitous species (present in all studied sierras). However, fragmentation of the Pampean landscape due to agricultural intensification has led to the loss of natural environments. Therefore, the reintroduction of E. regnellii in strategic places would facilitate the occurrence of wild pollinators, while favoring pollination services in the agroecosystem. The germination requirements of E. regnellii were studied because a better knowledge of the reproductive biology of this species would provide information relevant to its reproduction and reintroduction into degraded areas. Germination percentages and mean time to germination were evaluated, using one control and two pre-germination treatments: chemical scarification with sulfuric acid, and mechanical scarification with sand paper. Chemical scarified seeds did not germinate. Mechanically scarified and control seed groups showed no significant differences either in germination percentages (49% and 59% respectively) or in mean germination time (13 and 14 days, respectively). Results indicate that E. regnellii shows no physical dormancy, and does not require specific pre-germination treatments for germination under the studied laboratory conditions. The high germination capacity of E. regnellii, along with its ecological attributes, make it a potential species for restoring plant-pollinator interactions in the fragmented landscapes of the Southern Pampas.",2015

Black locust has important ecological and economic value, but its quality needs improvement. Hybridization programs are important for black locust breeding, but the low rate of fruit set after controlled pollination limits both its breeding and that of other monoclinous plant species that share this problem. In this study, we investigated gene expression in emasculated black locust flowers using the cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism technique to determine why the rate of fruit set is low after controlled pollination. Flowers that were emasculated after being frozen in liquid nitrogen were used as controls. Changes in the flower transcriptome were more dramatic at 5 h after emasculation than at 48 h. Injury caused by emasculation decreased the expression levels of genes associated with metabolism, growth regulation, signal transduction, and photosynthesis, and it increased the expression of genes related to stress-response metabolism, signal transduction, and promotion of senescence. The changes in the expression levels of these genes had negative effects on sugar metabolism, protein metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, matter transport, signal transduction, osmotic regulation, pH regulation, and photosynthesis. Thus, emasculation accelerated flower senescence, resulting in low fruit set.",2015

Invasive non-native plants form interactions with native species and have the potential to cause direct and indirect impacts on those species, as well as the functioning of invaded ecosystems. 2. Many entomophilous invasive plants form interactions with resident pollinators; sometimes, these interactions are necessary for the reproductive success of the invader. However, the direct role native pollinators play in plant invasion is not well understood and varies according to invasive plant traits, including breeding system and pollination syndrome. 3. The majority of studies addressing impacts on plant-pollinator mutualisms have focussed on the indirect impacts of plant invasion for native plant pollination. Fewer studies have focussed on the direct effects of invasive plants on native flower visitors. 4. Impacts of invasive plants on native pollinators can occur at a range of scales: from the individual flower visitors (in terms of nutrition, health and fitness), to populations (size, density and growth rates), communities (richness, diversity and composition) and community-level interactions (insect-flower interaction networks). Most research to date has focussed on community-level impacts, with almost nothing known about the effects of invaders on native flower visitor individuals or populations. 5. Invasive plant traits, including reward quantity and quality, spatial and temporal availability and accessibility, modulate effects on native flower visitors, and thus, different plant species have different impacts. Similarly, flower visitors do not all respond in the same way to invasive plants. Thus, generalizations are difficult to make, but understanding impacts at the individual and population level for different visitor taxa is key to explaining community-level impacts. 6. There have been varied approaches to determining impacts, with most studies attempting to compare invaded vs. non-invaded habitats. The pros and cons of different approaches are discussed. 7. Since it is impractical to study every invasive plant in every ecological context in which it occurs, we recommend a better understanding of relevant individual-level traits to predict direct interactions between invasive plants and native pollinators.",2017
Precipitation and the robustness of a plant and flower-visiting insect network in a xeric ecosystem,Ecological network; Pollination; Flower-visiting insects; Precipitation; Grassland,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS; CLIMATE; VISITATION; MODULARITY; PATTERNS; MONSOON,"Complex networks of species interactions are integral to the stability of ecological communities. The responses of these networks to extreme environmental fluctuations are key to understanding the evolution of these networks and their roles in stabilizing ecological communities. From 2008 to 2009 we observed the effects of extreme differences in annual precipitation on a network of plants and flower visiting insects in a xeric grassland. Significant decreases in plant and insect diversity in the dry year were mirrored by decreases in the number of network nodes and links. However, the relative density of network connections increased in the dry year and other important topological features, such as nestedness and modularity, were largely unchanged. The resilience of the network to node (plants or insect species) loss was high in both years. Though bees tend to dominate pollination communities in drier climes, we did not observe a shift in the relative richness of bee species in the dry year. Our results indicate that well-linked, drought-resistant plants are important to community resilience during ecologically challenging periods and that networks of plants and flowering-visiting insects may be robust to extreme climatic change, at least over short periods, as long as those critical, resilient hubs are protected.",2017
Reproductive biology and nectar secretion dynamics of Penstemon gentianoides (Plantaginaceae): a perennial herb with a mixed pollination system?,Hymenoptera; Plantaginaceae; Penstemon; Hummingbirds; Mixed-pollination syndrome,HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; SCROPHULARIACEAE; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; CONVERGENCE; DIVERGENCE; FOREST; BEE; PSEUDOSPECTABILIS,"Background. In many plant species, pollination syndromes predict the most effective pollinator. However, other floral visitors may also offer effective pollination services and promote mixed pollination systems. Several species of the species-rich Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) exhibit a suite of floral traits that suggest adaptation for pollination by both hymenopterans and hummingbirds. Transitions from the ancestral hymenopteran pollination syndrome to more derived hummingbird pollination syndrome may be promoted if the quantity or quality of visits by hummingbirds is increased and if the ancestral pollinator group performs less efficiently. The quantification of such shifts in pollination systems in the group is still limited. We aimed to investigate floral traits linked to this pollination syndrome in Penstemon gentianoides with flowers visited by bumblebees and hummingbirds. Methods. We investigated the floral biology, pollinator assemblages, breeding system and nectar production patterns ofP. gentianoides inhabiting a temperate montane forest in central Mexico. Pollination experiments were also conducted to assess the pollinator effectiveness of bumblebees and hummingbirds. Results. P. gentianoides flowers are protandrous, with 8-d male phase (staminate) flowers, followed by the similar to 1-7 d female phase (pistillate phase). Flowers display traits associated with hymenopteran pollination, including purple flowers abruptly ampliate-ventricose to a broad throat with anthers and stigmas included, and long lifespans. However, the nectar available in the morning hours was abundant and dilute, traits linked to flowers with a hummingbird pollination syndrome. Two hummingbird species made most of the visits to flowers, Selasphorus platycercus (30.3% of all visits), followed by Archilochus colubris (11.3%). Bumblebees (Bombus ephippiatus, B. huntii and B. weisi) accounted for 51.8% of all recorded visits, but their foraging activity was restricted to the warmer hours. Hummingbirds made more foraging bouts and visited more flowers than hymenopteran species. Flowers experimentally pollinated by B. ephippiatus produced significantly more fruits than those pollinated by S. platycercus. However, there was no statistical difference in the number of seeds produced per fruit when a bumblebee or a hummingbird was the pollinator. Conclusions. We have shown that bumblebees and hummingbirds visit and pollinate P. gentianoides flowers. Despite floral traits resembling the hymenoptera pollination syndrome, flowers of P. gentianoides offer characteristic nectar rewards to flowers with a hummingbird pollination syndrome. Although pollination efficiency is higher among flowers visited by hymenoptera, the noteworthy percentage of fruit production and number of seeds per fruit derived from hummingbird pollination highlights the importance of hummingbirds as a functional group of pollinators that might have potential evolutionary consequences to the plants.",2017
The potential indirect effects among plants via shared hummingbird pollinators are structured by phenotypic similarity,Atlantic forest; competition; ecological interactions; facilitation; floral traits; pollinator sharing; reproductive interference; tropical pollination networks,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; POLLEN LIMITATION; NETWORKS; COMPETITION; ORGANIZATION; FOREST; TRAITS; AVAILABILITY,"Plant species within communities may overlap in pollinators' use and influence visitation patterns of shared pollinators, potentially engaging in indirect interactions (e.g., facilitation or competition). While several studies have explored the mechanisms regulating insect-pollination networks, there is a lack of studies on bird-pollination systems, particularly in species-rich tropical areas. Here, we evaluated if phenotypic similarity, resource availability (floral abundance), evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology affect the potential for indirect effects via shared pollinators in hummingbird-pollinated plant species within four communities in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Among the evaluated factors, phenotypic similarity (corolla length and anther height) was the most important variable, while resource availability (floral abundance) had a secondary importance. On the other hand, evolutionary relatedness and flowering phenology were less important, which altogether highlights the relevance of convergent evolution and that the contribution of a plant to the diet of the pollinators of another plant is independent of the level of temporal overlap in flowering in this tropical system. Interestingly, our findings contrast with results from multiple insect-pollinated plant communities, mostly from temperate regions, in which floral abundance was the most important driver, followed by evolutionary relatedness and phenotypic similarity. We propose that these contrasting results are due to high level of specialization inherent to tropical hummingbird-pollination systems. Moreover, our results demonstrated that factors defining linkage rules of plant-hummingbird networks also determinate plant-plant potential indirect effects. Future studies are needed to test if these findings can be generalized to other highly specialized systems. Overall, our results have important implications for the understanding of ecological processes due resource sharing in mutualistic systems.",2017

A crucial first step in recognition is the identification of edges and the segmentation of the visual field into areas that belong together. Honeybees and bumblebees acquire visual information through three types of photoreceptors; however, they only use a single receptor type-the one sensitive to longer wavelengths-for edge detection and movement detection. Here, we show that these long-wavelength receptors (peak sensitivity at similar to 544 nm, i.e., green) provide the most consistent signals in response to natural objects. Using our multispectral image database of flowering plants, we found that long-wavelength receptor responses had, depending on the specific scenario, up to four times higher signal-to-noise ratios than the short- and medium-wavelength receptors. The reliability of the long-wavelength receptors emerges from an intricate interaction between flower coloration and the bee's visual system. This finding highlights the adaptive significance of bees using only long-wavelength receptors to locate flowers among leaves, before using information provided by all three receptors to distinguish the rewarding flower species through trichromatic color vision.",2017

It is crucial to enhance the knowledge on this species' floral biology, since interactions related to reproduction of plants are critical for the long term maintenance of their populations. Thus, we investigated the sexual reproduction and floral biology of Z. tuberculosa, including nectar features, aiming to understand the ecological processes associated to this mutualistic plant-animal interaction in the current modified landscape. For this, we performed experiments under natural conditions and in the laboratory. All the evaluated plants were self-incompatible. Zeyheria tuberculosa was pollinated by Bombus pauloensis, a medium-sized bee, and offered hexose-rich nectar as resource. Flowers were also visited by small-sized bee species, Trigona spinipes, that acted as pollen thief, and Pseudoaugochlora pandora and P. graminae that acted as nectar thieves. These three bee groups exhibited temporal separation in the peak of visits throughout the day. The peak of pollinator visits occurred firstly, which may allow the pollinator to access nectar and pollen loads before they are exploited by thieves. However, bee pollinator visits were scarce, and this fact, associated to the self-incompatibility of Z. tuberculosa, may explain the low fruit set registered in the studied plants. It could be of special concern for this threatened species maintenance in the medium and long term, which depends on the offspring originated by sexual reproduction.  ",2017

Such sustainable increases may be especially important for the 2 billion people reliant on small farms, many of which are undernourished, yet we know little about the efficacy of this approach. Using a coordinated protocol across regions and crops, we quantify to what degree enhancing pollinator density and richness can improve yields on 344 fields from 33 pollinator-dependent crop systems in small and large farms from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. For fields less than 2 hectares, we found that yield gaps could be closed by a median of 24% through higher flower-visitor density. For larger fields, such benefits only occurred at high flower-visitor richness. Worldwide, our study demonstrates that ecological intensification can create synchronous biodiversity and yield outcomes.",2016

To address this gap, we studied a bee that forages for pollen from multiple species of plants and may therefore acquire diverse bacteria from different plants. We tested the hypothesis that pollen diversity correlates with bacterial diversity by simultaneously characterizing these two communities in bee brood provisions for the first time. We used deep sequencing of the plant RBCL gene and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to characterize pollen and bacterial diversity. We then tested for associations between pollen and bacterial species richness and community composition, as well as co-occurrence of specific bacteria and pollen types. We found that both pollen and bacterial communities were extremely diverse, indicating that mother bees visit a wide variety of flowers for pollen and nectar and subsequently bring a diversity of microbes back into their nests. Pollen and bacterial species richness and community composition, however, were not correlated. Certain pollen types significantly co-occurred with the most proportionally abundant bacteria, indicating that the plants these pollen types came from may serve as reservoirs for these bacteria. Even so, the overall diversity of these communities appears to mask these associations at a broader scale. Further study of these pollen and bacteria associations will be important for understanding the complicated relationship between bacteria and wild bees.",2016

In this context, selective pressures are likely to favor the presence of floral traits adequate to a variety of pollinators. In this paper, we document the pollination ecology of Encholirium spectabile, focusing on nectar production pattern, and on the frequency, behavior and effectiveness of day- and nighttime pollinators. We have addressed two main questions: (1) Are the flowers traits of E. spectabile favorable to a mixed pollination system? and (2) Do diurnal and nocturnal visitors behave as effective pollinators? Nectar traits of E. spectabile were similar to other chiropterophilous and ornithophilous bromeliads, and the main pollinators were exclusively vertebrates, both nocturnal (bats and opossum), and diurnal (hummingbirds and Passeriformes). Despite E. spectabile is primarily chiropterophilous, its flowers were open during the entire day and night, with continuous nectar production, what is favorable to the occurrence of a mixed pollination system, involving a unique richness of vertebrate as pollinators of a single plant species. This strategy has assured to E. spectabile high frequency of visits along flowering with high reproductive success.     ",2016
Much more than bees-Wildflower plantings support highly diverse flower-visitor communities from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes,Agri-environment scheme (AES); Ecosystem services; Flower resources; Landscape; Farmland biodiversity; Restoration,POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; CROP POLLINATION; OILSEED RAPE; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; METAANALYSIS; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; HABITAT,"One goal of wildflower plantings is to promote biodiversity in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Flower visitors of wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g., wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14 wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their surrounding landscape context within a 500 m radius (percentage arable land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were sampled in the early (May-June) and late (June-July) flowering season and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1%) of all 322 visiting species (<50.0% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241 non-prominent 'other' visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g. predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees, wildflower plantings support a high diversity of functionally complementary flower-visitor species from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community.

While arctic flowers are visited by a wide range of insects, flies in family Muscidae have been proposed as a pollinator group of particular importance. To understand the functional outcome of current changes in pollinator community composition, we examined the role of muscids in the pollination of a key plant species, the mountain avens (Dryas). We monitored the seed set of Dryas across 15 sites at Zackenberg, northeast Greenland, and used sticky flower mimics and DNA barcoding to describe the flower-visiting community at each site. To evaluate the consequences of shifts in pollinator phenology under climate change, we compared the flower visitors between the early and the late season. Our approach revealed a diverse community of insects visiting Dryas, including two-thirds of all insect species known from the area. Even against this diverse background, the abundance of muscid flies emerged as a key predictor for seed set in Dryas, whereas overall insect abundance and species richness had little or no effect.

Cost-efficiency of fallowing schemes could be enhanced through improved understanding of key characteristics of fallows and surrounding landscape that determine community composition and provide support for species of conservation concern. Impacts of fallow characteristics and landscape structure on the species composition of butterflies and bumblebees were studied in two types of perennial fallows in boreal farmland. To understand species' responses to environmental factors from a conservation perspective, community composition was examined with respect to two species traits-niche breadth and dispersal capacity. Whereas overall species composition of butterflies and bumblebees was strongly affected by forest cover in the surrounding landscape, the studied species traits were most related to fallow type and the cover of perennial grasslands. Habitat breadth of butterflies was narrowest in long-term grassland fallows in landscapes with high grassland cover. Dispersal capacity of butterflies was also lowest in grassland-rich landscapes. Diet breadth of bumblebees was narrower in long-term grassland fallows than in short-term fallows. The results confirm that the diversity of butterflies and bumblebees can be enhanced by establishing and managing fallows both in open and forested landscapes. For conservation of habitat specialists and less mobile species, retention of long-term fallows in grassland-rich landscapes is apparently the best option. The results provide no justification for exempting forested regions or farms with high grassland cover from the ecological focus area requirement under the European Union's current agricultural policy.",2016

However, the simultaneous and multiple impacts of land-use decisions on these assets are often ignored. In this study, we focus on pollinator-friendly practices (PIT: practices that intend to increase the abundance and diversity of natural pollinators) to quantify the multi-dimensional value of land-use decisions and to address potential synergies and trade-offs among assets. We combined socio-economic and ecological methods to quantify natural (pollinator richness) and anthropogenic (human, physical, social, and financial) assets in 30 coffee plantations with a gradient in the number of PFP in eastern Brazil. We found that an increase in the number of PFP resulted in both enhanced flower-visitor richness (natural asset) and coffee yield (financial asset). Farmers who dedicated more time to field work than to administrative work applied more PFP on their farms. Our results highlight that land-use decisions oriented toward enhancing natural assets can also provide the highest levels of financial assets. This provides a general framework for efforts toward ecological intensification that can be employed in other regions.",2016

Here, we evaluated the influence of landscape structure over bee community composition and coffee (Coffea arabica) pollination. Our study was undertaken in one of the most important coffee-producing regions of Brazil, and comprised nine landscapes of sun coffee plantations surrounded by different amounts of Atlantic Forest remnants. Using floral exclusion experiments we evaluated fruit set in 15 coffee shrubs per landscape. We also sampled the bees visiting coffee flowers. Our analyses were made at two landscape scales, with 1 and 2 km radii, and one shrub scale, with 300 m radius around each coffee shrub. We collected 241 bee individuals and identified a total of 22 species. The honeybee Apis mellifera (Apini) was the most abundant flower visitor followed by Trigona spinipes (Meliponini). Native bee abundance, richness and diversity were positively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. Honeybee abundance, on the other hand, was negatively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. The presence of bees resulted in an increase in coffee fruit set of 28%. A. mellifera abundance positively affected fruit set across spatial scales, while the composition of the native bee community affected fruit set differently at the landscape scales than at the shrub scale. Our work shows that bee pollination services are affected by landscape structure at different spatial scales. These findings can be used in conservation and agricultural planning to maximize crop production while safeguarding biodiversity and the provision of pollination services.    ",2016

Mutualistic interactions structure ecological communities and they are strongly influenced by the combined effect of different drivers of global change. Land-use changes and global warming have elicited rapid shrub encroachment in alpine grasslands in recent decades, which may have detrimental outcomes for native alpine forbs. In spite of the importance of this process, we lack knowledge about how shrub encroachment modifies community-wide patterns of plant-pollinator mutualistic interactions. 2. Based on the functional biodiversity hypothesis (FBH), which predicts higher pollinator biodiversity in species-rich plant communities, we asked whether the increase in nutritional resources available for pollinators due to shrub expansion modifies pollinator niche breadth and species richness, and whether these changes affect plant-plant interactions. 3. For this purpose, we compared quantitative plant-flower visitor interaction network assemblages at replicated plots in two habitat types in dry cryophilic grasslands of Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain): (i) encroached pastures (EP) and (ii) pastures dominated by forb species where shrub species are absent (PA). 4. As predicted by FBH, flower visitor richness increased in EP, but their niche breadth did not vary. Furthermore, shrubs had more interactions with flower visitors and received more visits per plant than forbs in EP in agreement with their significantly higher linkage and strength. 5. Overall, results revealed that moderate levels of shrub encroachment affected the flower visitation patterns of forb species in alpine grasslands as flower visitor diversity increased and plant-plant competition for shared flower visitors became greater. These findings highlight the need to use an integrative approach to study the cascading effects of global change drivers on species interactions and their impact on the structure and functioning of threatened ecological communities.",2016

Flower visitation, an important indicator of pollination services, is influenced by plant species richness. However, the spatio-temporal responses of different pollinator groups to plant species richness have not yet been analyzed experimentally. Here, we used an experimental plant species richness gradient to analyze plant-pollinator interactions with an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We observed four pollinator functional groups (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, and hoverflies) in experimental plots at three different vegetation strata between sunrise and sunset. Visits were modified by plant species richness interacting with time and space. Furthermore, the complementarity of pollinator functional groups in space and time was stronger in species-rich mixtures. We conclude that high plant diversity should ensure stable pollination services, mediated via spatio-temporal niche complementarity in flower visitation.",2016

However, the persistence of invaders in a wide range of ecological communities may mean that they provide resources and refuge for threatened native species, or supplement ecosystem services. Location Agroecosystems in the USA. Methods We use a 2-year field experiment to explore the potential positive and negative impacts of an invasive thistle (Carduus acanthoides) on the composition of the resident community of foraging insects. The presence or absence of the thistle was the only difference in experimental and control plots comprising a background community of ten flowering annual species. Results We demonstrate that the invasive thistle is both highly visited and strongly preferred by bees relative to other flowering species. Bee abundance was 302% higher and bee species richness 35% higher in habitat patches where the thistle was present compared to where it was absent. In addition, the abundance of Bombus species, a native group recently found to be in decline, was 479% higher when the thistle was present. Main conclusions Our results suggest that, despite causing significant problems, the invasion of this non-native species may also provide crucial benefits via floral resources for pollinators. Benefits, such as the floral resources that invaders provide to pollinators, should also be taken into account in conservation and invader management plans. Eradication or complete removal of invasive species which provision insects with floral resources could have unintended negative impacts on the associated pollinator community.",2016

Additionally, most distylous species have an incompatibility system linked to the discrete variation of anthers and stigmas. Here we provide new data on heterostyly, reproductive biology and pollination in four Psychotria spp. from the Cerrado Region (Brazil). Psychotria deflexa, P.nitidula and P.trichophoroides fitted the distylous morphological syndrome, whereas P.prunifolia was monomorphic and self-compatible. Reciprocity varied across species, with the upper whorl of anthers and stigmas being more reciprocal than the lower whorl. Psychotria nitidula has a heteromorphic incompatibility system, whereas P.deflexa and P.trichophoroides showed partial self-compatibility. Psychotria prunifolia and P.trichophoroides were visited by large bees and exhibited lower reproductive efficacy than P.nitidula and P.deflexa, which are visited by wasps and small bees. Our results provide new evidence that the morphological distylous syndrome does not always co-occur with heteromorphic incompatibility and additional mechanisms (e.g. disassortative pollen transfer) may operate to maintain the polymorphism and isoplethy of species with different incompatibility system.",2016

Four species are newly recorded for some islands, as follows: Coelioxys abdominalis Guerin, 1844, new island record for Marie-Galante and Martinique, Centris decolorata Lepeletier, 1841, new island record for Marie-Galante, Melissodes rufodentatus Smith, 1854, is newly recorded from Guadeloupe and Mesoplia azurea (Lepeletier & Serville, 1825) from La Desirade. The bee fauna of the FWI is mostly composed of species that occur (or may be expected to occur) throughout much of the West Indies, combined with species that are widely distributed on the mainland and a proportion of regionally endemic species. In addition to these elements, there appear to be at least a few locally endemic species. A few species of bees appear to be oligolectic; their host plants, however, are visited by a wide variety of bees and other insects. There is only one intentionally introduced bee in Guadeloupe, the European honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, and three non-native bees that reached the FWI from other parts of the Caribbean and the mainland: Megachile (Pseudomegachile) lanata (Fabricius, 1775), M. (Callomegachile) rufipennis (Fabricius, 1793) and M. (Eutricharaea) concinna Smith, 1879. Honey bees are often extremely abundant, and dominate nectar and pollen resources in ways that are disruptive to native bees. Although it is easy to observe individual honey bees displacing individual native bees on flowers, there are no data on the ecological effects of honey bees on native pollinators in the FWI.",2016

In the natural forest of Wondo Genet, Ethiopia, 25 mature individuals of four indigenous species were selected and monitored over two years. Flower visiting insects were trapped with sweep nets at an interval of every two hours between 8:00-18:00 for 20 days. Circular statistics were employed to test for seasonality in flowering and fruiting. The visitor community compositions of the four species were compared with permutational ANOVA. While the tree species expressed synchronous seasonal flowering that peaked during the dry period, fruiting was also seasonal. The mean monthly rainfall and temperature correlated significantly with the periods of the phenophases.

Contrasting Partners' Traits of Generalized and Specialized Species in Flower-Visitation Networks,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; ARCHITECTURE; MAINTENANCE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS,"Much ecological research has focused on trying to understand why species are generalized or specialized in their interactions and how networks develop in a certain environment. It is now well known that traits such as phenology and abundance of a species are important determinants of its generalization level (i.e., number of different interactions or links to other species). Less information is available, however, on whether generalized and specialized species differ in particular traits of their interacting partners. Such partners might differ, for instance, in abundance and/or in the diversity of functional groups they belong to. Moreover, species might exhibit shifts through time (e.g., flowering season) in their partners' traits, though we know close to nothing on whether these changes do indeed occur. Assessing how such network links in both types of species are established is important for a better understanding of how different types of disturbance can affect community dynamics. Using data from four quantitative flower-visitation networks and independent measures of flower availability obtained when recording interactions, we test for such differences between species which have been previously categorized according to two specialization indexes: (1) number of partners (links), also named linkage level; this is a qualitative index and (2) complementary specialization d', named here selectiveness level; this is a quantitative index. We found that: (1) species with low linkage levels mainly interact with common species in the community whereas generalized species interact with a greater heterogeneity of partner's abundances and functional richness, (2) both selective and opportunistic species (with high and low d', respectively) interact with a similarly high functional richness (number of functional groups or families) of partners, and (3) generalized species are the only ones showing shifts along the season in their partners' traits, driven by changes in community species composition. The risk of extinction in front of a disturbance is generally expected to be highest for specialized species (with few partners) and selective species (which visit non-abundant or scarce partners). However, our findings show that by linking to abundant and/or to functionally diverse partners, respectively, these species may be maintained in the community and be less vulnerable to disturbances.",2016
Temporal- and density-dependent impacts of an invasive plant on pollinators and pollination services to a native plant,Centaurea stoebe; competition; Heterotheca villosa; Montana; mutualism; plant-pollinator networks; spotted knapweed,CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; ALIEN PLANT; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; DIFFUSA; BIOLOGY; BEES; METAANALYSIS,"Pollinators and pollination services are under threat globally, and invasive plants have been implicated in their decline. Results of previous studies suggest that consequences of invasion for pollinators and plant-pollinator interactions are context specific. Investigating factors such as the density of an invasive plant and its phenology may provide a nuanced understanding of invasive species impacts. We conducted a 2-yr study in Montana to investigate how local pollinator abundance, richness, community composition, and visitation patterns varied with invasive Centaura stoebe density and phenology, and whether C. stoebe altered the reproduction of a co-flowering native plant, Heterotheca villosa, through changes in pollinator visitation. In an observational study, we found that during its peak bloom in August, Centaurea stoebe provided abundant floral resources to late-season pollinators. However, prior to C. stoebe bloom, native floral density and pollinator abundance and richness of these plots were lower compared to plots where C. stoebe was low or absent. Pollinator community composition in plots without C. stoebe was different compared to plots with C. stoebe (both high and low C. stoebe density), and these differences in pollinator composition strongly depended on the time of season. In an experimental study, we found that there was little evidence of competition between C. stoebe and H. villosa for pollinators at low relative densities of C. stoebe. Using experimental pollen supplementation, we observed no evidence of pollen limitation of seed set in H. villosa with increasing density of experimentally added C. stoebe. Our results suggest that the impact of an invasive plant on pollinators and plant-pollinator interactions depends on the relative density of the invasive plant and the timing of its bloom. Differences in pollinator visitation patterns over the growing season suggest that although C. stoebe provides abundant resources to late-season pollinators, displacement of native plants at high C. stoebe density may indirectly harm pollinators that are active before C. stoebe blooms or that prefer native plants. Based on our results, restricting C. stoebe to low densities may help mitigate negative repercussions to native plant reproduction and may even be beneficial to some pollinators.",2016
The forgotten flies: the importance of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators,non-syrphid Diptera; pollinators; pollen-loads; pollen-transport networks; Syrphidae,INTERACTION NETWORKS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; PLANT; BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; CROP; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; DECLINES,"Bees, hoverflies and butterflies are taxa frequently studied as pollinators in agricultural and conservation contexts. Although there are many records of non-syrphid Diptera visiting flowers, they are generally not regarded as important pollinators. We use data from 30 pollen-transport networks and 71 pollinator-visitation networks to compare the importance of various flower-visiting taxa as pollen-vectors. We specifically compare non-syrphid Diptera and Syrphidae to determine whether neglect of the former in the literature is justified. We found no significant difference in pollen-loads between the syrphid and non-syrphid Diptera. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the level of specialization between the two groups in the pollen-transport networks, though the Syrphidae had significantly greater visitation evenness. Flower visitation data from 33 farms showed that non-syrphid Diptera made up the majority of the flower-visiting Diptera in the agricultural studies (on average 82% abundance and 73% species richness), and we estimate that non-syrphid Diptera carry 84% of total pollen carried by farmland Diptera. As important pollinators, such as bees, have suffered serious declines, it would be prudent to improve our understanding of the role of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators.",2015

Location Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39 degrees N-32 degrees S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R-2 = 0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R-2 = 0.20-0.44 and R-2 = 0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems.",2015

Resource availability is often considered as the major driver of animal diversity. However, in ectotherms, temperature might play a predominant role as it modulates metabolic rates and the access of animals to resources. Here, we investigate the relative importance of resource availability and temperature in determining the diversity pattern of bees along a 3.6-km elevational gradient. LocationMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. methods we assessed bee species richness and abundance with pan traps and floral resources with transect records on 60 study sites which were equally distributed over six near-natural and six disturbed habitat types along an elevational gradient from 870 to 4550m a.s.l. We used path analysis to disentangle the effects of temperature, precipitation, floral resource abundance, bee abundance and land use on bee species richness. In addition, we monitored flower visitation rates during transect walks at different elevations to evaluate the temperature dependence of bee-flower interactions. results bee species richness continuously declined with elevation in natural and disturbed habitats. While the abundance of floral resources had a significant but only weak effect on species richness, the effect of temperature was strong. Temperature had a strong positive effect on species richness that was not mediated by bee abundance and an indirect effect via bee abundances. We observed higher levels of bee-flower interactions at higher temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that temperature limits diversity by constraining resource exploitation in ectotherms. Main conclusions temperature and the availability of resources shape species richness patterns along environmental gradients. In ectothermic organisms like bees temperature seems to have the more important role, as it both limits the access to resources (abundance-mediated effect) and accelerates other (abundance-independent) ecological and evolutionary processes that drive the maintenance and origination of diversity.",2015
"Pollen limitation, species' floral traits and pollinator visitation: different relationships in contrasting communities",,SEED SET; PLANT REPRODUCTION; FLOWERING PLANTS; CENTRAL CHILE; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; SYSTEMS; SPECIALIZATION; FERTILIZATION; ENVIRONMENTS,"Failures in the process of pollen transfer among conspecific plants can severely impact female reproductive success. Thus, pollen limitation can cause selection on plant mating systems and floral traits. The relationships between pollen limitation and floral traits might be partly mediated by the quantity and identity of pollinator visits. However, very little is known about the relationship between pollinator visits and pollen limitation. We examined the relationships between pollen limitation and floral traits at the community level to connect them to community ecology processes. We used 48 plant species from two contrasting communities: one species-rich lowland community and one species-poor alpine community. In addition, we calculated visitation rates and ecological pollination generalization for 38 of the species to examine the relationship between pollinator visitation and pollen limitation at the community level. We found low overall levels of pollen limitation that did not differ significantly between the alpine and the lowland community. In both communities, species with evolutionary specialized flowers were more pollen limited than species with unspecialized flowers. Species' visitation rates and selfing capability were negatively related to pollen limitation in the alpine community, where pollinators are scarcer. However, flower size/number, ecological generalization of plants and flowering onset had greater effects on pollen limitation levels at the lowland community, indicating that the identity of the visitors and plant-plant competitive interactions are more decisive for plant reproduction in this species-rich community. There, pollen limitation increased with flower size and flowering onset, and decreased with ecological generalization, but only in species with evolutionary specialized flowers. Our study suggests that selection on plant mating system and floral traits may be idiosyncratic to each particular community and highlights the benefits of conducting community-level studies for a better understanding of the processes underlying evolutionary responses to pollen limitation.",2015
Functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities differently affect the structure of flower-visitor interactions and reveal convergences in floral traits,Antagonistic flower visitors; Barriers; Divergences; Evolution of flower traits; Networks; Quantitative functional traits,POLLINATION NETWORK; SPECIALIZATION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; NICHE; DISPLACEMENT; POPULATION; DYNAMICS,"Community ecology has moved from descriptive studies to more mechanistic approaches asking questions about causes and consequences of community composition and interactions between species. Many ecological processes are shaped by the presence or absence of functional groups, not necessarily species. Thus, the diversity of functional traits, i.e. their interspecific variation, is a key feature of plant communities with consequences on other trophic levels. In a simulation study based on a quantitative flower-visitor network and quantitative measurements of flower traits, we tested how the functional FDiv and phylogenetic diversity PDiv of plant communities affect animal species richness and diversity as well as network properties. Within the limitations of the assumption that plants maintain the qualitative and quantitative interactions with animals in subsampled communities, we found that functionally diverse plant communities support a large number of animal species (not necessarily animal diversity). Additionally, the network structure was more complementarily specialized (higher -values) and comprised a larger number of unrealized links (low connectance) and thus a higher partitioning of resources among consumers in functionally diverse plant communities than in communities with a lower FDiv. For the phylogenetic diversity PDiv of plant communities we found contrasting effects, which may be explained by divergences or convergences of functional traits. Our results support the notion that functionally diverse plant communities offer a large number of niches that can be occupied by a larger number of flower visiting species specialized to a specific set of flower traits. Thus, functional flower traits serve as barriers that exclude some flower visitors but also as attractive features that facilitate interactions with other animal species. Our study fosters a trait-based definition of niches and functional groups and may stimulate field studies testing the predictions of this simulation.",2015

In laboratory experiments with L. sericata, we investigated the effect of generic floral scent and color cues, and of Oxeye daisy-specific cues, on foraging decisions by recently eclosed flies. We also tested the effect of a floral pollen diet with 0-35% moisture content on the ability of females to mature their oocytes. Our data indicate that (1) young flies in the presence of generic floral scent respond more strongly to a uniformly yellow cue than to any other uniform color cue (green, white, black, blue, red) except for ultraviolet (UV); (2) the floral scent of Oxeye daisies enhances the attractiveness of a yellow cue; and (3) moisture-rich pollen provides nutrients that facilitate ovary maturation of flies. With evidence that L. sericata exploits floral cues during foraging, and that pollen can be an alternate protein source to animal feces and carrion, Pollen apparently plays a major role in the foraging ecology of L. sericata and possibly other filth flies. These flies, in turn, may play a significant role as pollinators, as supported by a recently published study.",2015

The introduction of livestock in natural areas is a common disturbance that affects both plant and pollinator diversity and might affect their interaction. Understanding whether livestock affect a food resource for pollinators (i.e. flower abundance) and/or a pollinator assemblage (i.e. abundance and richness) has important implications for plant-pollinator interactions and still needs deeper investigation. 2. This study investigated how pollinator communities and flower abundance determined floral visitation frequency along a grazing gradient, using seven large paddocks in Patagonian Monte Desert that varied in livestock densities. Pollinator visitation frequency was measured in five of the most abundant native plant species of the region, present in all the paddocks, but that differed in reproductive strategy ranging from insect-pollinated self-compatible and self-incompatible to wind-pollinated. The influence of livestock density, insect, and flower abundance on visitation frequency was evaluated using D-separation hierarchical path models. 3. Intermediate stocking densities showed the highest insect richness and abundance. Livestock density showed a negative quadratic relationship with insect richness; hymenopterans being the main insect group in the region. Flower density decreased with the increase in livestock density. The five plant species shared several pollinator species although each one supported a distinct assemblage. 4. The path model showed that livestock was not directly associated with pollinator visitation frequency; however, this apparent lack of association was as a result of opposite forces acting together. An increase in livestock density reduced visitation frequency through a decrease in insect abundance, yet, livestock simultaneously increased the pollinator visitation rate through decreased flower abundance. 5. This study describes how changes in the density of exotic mammals can affect pollinator and flower abundance, resulting in contrasting effects on flower visitation rates with, apparently, neutral net consequences. This illustrates the complexity of responses to plant-pollinator interactions to anthropogenic disturbances that alter the ecological context.",2015

We examined the effect of abiotic (elevation and precipitation) and biotic (flowering plant diversity) factors considered to be decisive causal factors of diversity patterns on anthophyllous insect communities on mountain forest. Sampling was carried out in 100-m transects at eight elevational levels and during a period of 8 months. All flowering plants in the understory and their flowering visitors were recorded. Species richness and diversity were estimated for each elevation and month. Diversity of flowering plants, elevation, and precipitation were used as independent variables in multiple regressions against insect diversity. The evaluated abiotic and biotic factors had contrasting effects on insect diversity: a significant decrease on insect diversity occurred at high elevation and dry months (i.e., threshold effect), while it showed a positive relationship with flowering plant diversity through time (i.e., linear effect), but not along elevation. Rapid turnover of species of both interacting guilds was observed every 100-m altitude and month. Local insect communities were also divided functionally depending on the plant family they visit. These results indicate that each insect community is distinctive among elevations and months and that diversity of flowering plants, precipitation, and elevation influence their structure and composition. Thus, conservation strategies should involve protection of forest cover at the whole elevation gradient, in order to preserve common and exclusive components of diversity and consequently, the mosaic of plant-pollinator interactions.",2015
Pollinators of Richardia grandiflora (Rubiaceae): an Important RuderalSpecies for Bees,Apis mellifera; largeflower Mexican clover; largeflower pusley; pollination; weed,FLOWER-VISITING BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE BEES; PLANTS; BRAZIL; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; NORTHEAST; ECOLOGY; SYSTEM,"Ruderal species may provide pollen and nectar to maintain the pollinators of crops in periods of floral resource shortage. The knowledge about the floral biology of these plant species and their interaction with insects is important for management strategies of agricultural systems. The study was carried out at an experimental research station in two different periods (August 2010-April 2011 and August 2012-January 2013). Floral biology was studied, and the reproductive system and reproductive efficacy (RE) were analyzed using controlled pollination experiments. Furthermore, floral visitors and pollination were identified and quantified. Reproductive success obtained in the open pollination and cross-pollination experiments was higher than those obtained in spontaneous self, hand self, and wind pollination. Richardia grandiflora bloomed throughout the experimental period, and flowers were visited by Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera, which were observed foraging for pollen and/or nectar. Among the floral visitors, bees were the richest and most frequent group and often contacted anthers and stigmas during visits. Africanized honeybees touched the floral reproductive structures in all visits, and their frequency may be related to changes in the reproductive efficacy between the study periods. Pollinator species of crops cultivated at the experimental research station were frequent bee visitors of R. grandiflora. We demonstrated that R. grandiflora requires cross-pollination and biotic pollen vectors. Among floral visitors, bees are the main pollinators, especially the Africanized honeybees. R. grandiflora can be considered an important ruderal species for maintaining bee pollinator populations at the study site, providing resources during the period that crops are not blooming.",2015
Theoretical predictions of plant-pollinator interactions in sympatric species of Psychotria (Rubiaceae) in Cerrado of Brazil,Brazilian savannah; floral phenology; network biology; niche overlap; pollination; sympatry,ATLANTIC FOREST; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FLOWER CONSTANCY; COSTA-RICA; COMMUNITY; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; PHENOLOGY; ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY,"Background and aims - In highly seasonal habitats, sympatric species are often constrained to flower simultaneously. Many sympatric species of Psychotria have similar floral traits, are pollinated by bees, moths, butterflies and flies and flower at the same time of year. This genus provides an opportunity to analyse the relationships between sympatric congeneric plants and pollinators. Interactions between potentially sympatric Psychotria species and their pollinators were surveyed to assess the occurrence of sharing, specialisation, or generalisation of pollinators and plants in the system. Methods - A dataset compiled from studies of pollination biology of this genus was used to investigate aspects of interactions with shared pollinators and flowering overlap. These data were used to draw a bipartite graph and analyse the interaction network and degree of niche overlap. Key results - In total, the dataset included eight species of potentially co-occurring Psychotria species, which interacted with 24 species of pollinators. The most generalised plant in the network was Psychotria trichophoroides. The pollinators with the highest number of links, and therefore the most important for the network, belonged to orders Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. Pollinators were shared among Psychotria species, thus pollination niches did overlap (theta = 0.20, P-random (>=) (observed) = 0.04), and plants of this genus depended on pollinators that were generalists among them. Conclusion - The peak of overlap in flowering phenology, when all of the species may potentially co-flower, coincided with the Cerrado rainy season. Since all Psychotria species occurred in sympatry, overlapped in flowering phenology, and had asymmetric interactions with floral visitors, it is possible that pollination facilitation is present in this system.",2015
FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF SOUTH AMERICAN CACTI. 1. DENMOZA RHODACANTHA,Cactaceae; Denmoza; South America; Argentina; pollination ecology,FLORAL VISITORS; CACTACEAE; SPECIALIZATION; ATTRACTION; SYSTEMS; TRAITS; MODES,"Pollination biology is an especially important component of the overall ecological setting of a plant species since it has direct implications on reproductive success. Over time, a typological approach to classifying flower-pollinator interactions in the form of ""floral syndromes"" has been developed, and considerable predictive power is traditionally ascribed to these syndromes. Recent studies have increasingly questioned both the predictive value of the syndrome concept, as well as the underlying notion of increasing specialization amongst flower-pollinator interactions. The casual discovery that the seemingly ornithophilous flowers of the globose to shortly columnar South American cactus Denmoza rhodacantha (Cactaceae: Cactoideae: Cereeae: Trichocereinae) are visited by solitary pollen-collecting halictid bees, rather than the expected hummingbirds, adds another example to the growing body of mismatches between floral syndrome and observed pollinator.",2015

The ecological function of secondary metabolites in plant defence against herbivores is well established, but their role in plant-pollinator interactions is less obvious. Nectar is the major reward for pollinators, so the occurrence of defence chemicals in the nectar of many species is unexpected. However, increasing evidence supports a variety of potential benefits for both plant and pollinator from these compounds. 2. Beneficial effects may include: (i) mediating specialization in plant-pollinator interactions, (ii) protecting nectar from robbery or larceny and (iii) microbial activity including preservation of nutrients in nectar from degradation and reduction in disease levels in pollinators. 3. Secondary metabolites in nectar can be toxic or repellent to flower visitors, but equally they can go undetected or even make nectar more apparent or attractive. These biological effects are concentration dependent, so must be considered at a range of ecologically relevant doses. For example, caffeine occurs in nectar and improves honeybee memory for odours associated with food rewards, which enhances pollen transfer at naturally occurring concentrations but is repellent to honeybees at higher concentrations. 4. This review synthesizes evidence from recent literature that supports selection for secondary metabolites in floral nectar as an adaptation that drives the co-evolution between plants and their pollinators. However, their presence in nectar could still simply be a consequence of their defensive role elsewhere in the plant (pleiotropy). We highlight the need for more studies demonstrating measurable benefits to the plant, the importance of exposure levels and effects on target species beyond the current emphasis on alkaloids and bees.",2017
Hummingbird floral traits interact synergistically to discourage visitation by bumble bee foragers,bumble bee; complex adaptation; floral specialization; Mimulus; multi-sensory floral signal; multisensory integration; plant-pollinator interactions; pollination syndrome; secondary pollinator,POLLINATION SYNDROMES; MONKEYFLOWERS MIMULUS; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; FLOWER CONSTANCY; OLFACTORY CUES; MANDUCA-SEXTA; RED FLOWERS; NECTAR; EVOLUTION,"Pollination syndromes are suites of floral traits presumed to reflect adaptations to attract and utilize a ""primary"" type of animal pollinator. However, syndrome traits may also function to deter ""secondary"" flower visitors that reduce plant fitness through their foraging activities. Here we use the hummingbird-pollinated plant species Mimulus cardinalis as a model to investigate the potential deterrent effects of classic bird syndrome traits on bumble bee foragers. To establish that M. cardinalis flowers elicit an avoidance response in bees, we assessed the choice behavior of individual foragers on a mixed experimental array of M. cardinalis and its bee-pollinated sister species M. lewisii. As expected, bees showed a strong preference against M. cardinalis flowers (only 22% of total bee visits were to M. cardinalis), but surprisingly also showed a high degree of individual specialization (95.2% of total plant transitions were between conspecifics). To determine M. cardinalis floral traits that discourage bee visitation, we then assessed foraging responses of individuals to M. cardinalis-like and M. lewisii-like floral models differing in color, orientation, reward, and combinations thereof. Across experiments, M. cardinalis-like trait combinations consistently produced a higher degree of flower avoidance behavior and individual specialization than expected based on bee responses to each trait in isolation. We then conducted a series of flower discrimination experiments to assess the ability of bees to utilize traits and trait combinations associated with each species. Relative to M. lewisii-like alternatives, M. cardinalis-like traits alone had a minimal effect on bee foraging proficiency but together increased the time bees spent searching for rewarding flowers from 1.49 to 2.65 s per visit. Collectively, our results show that M. cardinalis flowers impose foraging costs on bumble bees sufficient to discourage visitation and remarkably, generate such costs through synergistic color-orientation and color-reward trait interactions. Floral syndromes therefore represent complex adaptations to multiple pollinator groups, rather than simply the primary pollinator.",2017

Proboscis length has been proposed as a key dimension of plant pollination niches, but this niche space has not previously been explored at regional and global scales for any pollination system. Hawkmoths are ideal organisms for exploring pollinator niches as they are important pollinators in most of the biodiverse regions of the earth and vary greatly in proboscis length, with some species having the longest proboscides of all insects. 2. Using data sets for nine biogeographical regions spanning the Old and New World, we ask whether it is possible to identify distinct hawkmoth pollination niches based on the frequency distribution of proboscis length, and whether these niches are reflected in the depths of flowers that are pollinated by hawkmoths. We also investigate the levels of specialization in hawkmoth pollination systems at the regional and community level using data from interaction network studies. 3. We found that most regional hawkmoth assemblages have bimodal or multimodal distributions of proboscis length and that these are matched by similar distributions of floral tube lengths. Hawkmoths, particularly those with longer proboscides, are polyphagous and at the network level show foraging specialization equivalent to or less than that of bees and hummingbirds. In the case of plants, shorter-tubed flowers are usually visited by numerous hawkmoth species, while those that are longer-tubed tend to exclude shorter-proboscid hawkmoths and thus become ecologically specialized on longer-proboscid hawkmoth species. Longer-tubed flowers tend to have greater nectar rewards, and this promotes short-term constancy by longproboscid hawkmoths. 4. Our results show that pollinator proboscis length is a key niche axis for plants and can account for the patterns of evolution in functional traits such as floral tube length and nectar volume. We also highlight a paradoxical trend for nectar resource niche breadth to increase according to proboscis length of pollinators, while pollinator niche breadth decreases according to the tube length of flowers.",2017
High cover of hedgerows in the landscape supports multiple ecosystem services in Mediterranean cereal fields,aphid; biological control; ecosystem services; field-margin diversification; hedgerows; landscape complexity; natural enemies; off-field interventions; pollination; weed control,INTENSIVELY MANAGED AGRICULTURE; PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NATURAL PEST-CONTROL; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; WILD POLLINATORS; FOOD SECURITY; NATIVE BEES; CROP PEST; COMPLEXITY,"1. Field-margin diversification through conservation and restoration of hedgerows is becoming a prominent intervention for promoting biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in intensive agricultural landscapes. However, how increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape can affect ecosystem services has rarely been considered. 2. Here, we assessed the effect of increased field-margin complexity at the local scale and increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape on the provision of pest control, weed control and potential pollination. Locally, three types of field margin were compared as follows: (i) standard grass margin, (ii) simple hedgerow and (iii) complex hedgerow, along two independent gradients of hedgerow cover and arable land cover in the landscape. We performed an exclusion experiment to measure biological control of cereal aphids and assessed natural enemy and pest abundance in the field. We sampled plant weed communities and performed a phytometer experiment to test the effects of pollinators on plant reproductive success. 3. At the local scale, planting a new hedgerow or improving its structural complexity and vegetation diversity did not enhance the delivery of ecosystem services in the neighbouring field. 4. However, high cover of hedgerows in the landscape enhanced aphid parasitism (from 12 to 18%) and potential pollination (visitation rate and seed set increased up to 70%) irrespective of local margin quality. The cover of arable land in the landscape reduced the abundance of plant-dwelling predators and weed diversity, but did not affect the delivery of the investigated ecosystem services. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the key importance of the surrounding landscape context, rather than local factors, to the delivery of ecosystem services. This suggests a need for new policies that pay particular attention to the conservation of hedgerows at large scales for promoting multiple ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Specifically, hedgerows can serve to develop a network of ecological corridors that can facilitate the movement of beneficial organisms, such as pollinators and natural enemies in the agricultural matrix. Such interventions may be a 'low cost-high benefit solution', since farmers can create or conserve high-quality habitats taking little or no land from crop production and without the need to change their crop management.",2017

Specialization in plant-pollinator relationships is a core concept in discussions of plant evolution and ecology; it is central to our thinking, not just about the ecology of plant-pollinator interactions and pollinator services, but also about reproductive isolation, speciation, extinction and assembly of communities. However, as reviewed here, the concept ` plant-pollinator specialization' has multiple definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding. 2. This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and usage of plant-pollinator specialization, including distinguishing between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk. 3. In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.",2017

Generally, three main proximate causes for a female advantage are considered: inbreeding avoidance, different resource allocation patterns, and differences in ecological interactions. A mechanism potentially causing a female advantage that is rarely discussed is a difference in floral longevity between the genders. Females may have a longer stigma lifespan than hermaphrodites, which can affect pollination. Stigma and flower lifespan are rarely documented in gynodioecious species, although it is a common observation in dioecious species that female plants flower longer than males. Here we focus on the stigma and flower lifespan of gynodioecious Geranium sylvaticum, which could potentially contribute to the female advantage observed in this and other closely related species. We measured the stigma and flower lifespan in unpollinated flowers of female, hermaphrodite and plants with an intermediate gender expression. Our results show that stigma lifespan is almost twice as long in females as in hermaphrodites and intermediate plants. Also flower lifespan is longest in females. We discuss the potential mechanisms through which an increased floral lifespan can lead to a female advantage despite the generally lower pollinator visitation rates observed in females by reviewing available studies. Our study shows that increased floral persistence in females can be an important aspect in the maintenance of females in gynodioecious plants and should be taken into account as a potential proximate cause for a female advantage.

Intensified wind pollination mediated by pollen dimorphism after range expansion in an ambophilous biennial Aconitum gymnandrum,bumblebee pollination; marginal population; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; refugium population; reproductive assurance; wind pollination,QINGHAI-TIBETAN PLATEAU; PERIPHERAL-POPULATIONS; GENETIC-VARIATION; SEX ALLOCATION; ALPINE PLANTS; EVOLUTION; RANUNCULACEAE; ECOLOGY; INSECT; HISTORY,"Pollination systems and associated floral traits generally differ between core and marginal populations of a species. However, such differences are rarely examined in plants with a mixed wind-and bumblebee-pollination system, and the role of wind pollination during range expansion in ambophilous plants remains unclear. We compared floral traits and the contributions of bumblebee and wind pollination in refugium and marginal populations of the ambophilous plant Aconitum gymnandrum. We found that most floral traits differed between the two populations, and those traits associated with the shift to wind pollination were pronounced in the marginal population. Bumblebee visitation rates varied significantly, but were generally low in the marginal population. Wind pollination occurred in both populations, and the efficiency was lower than that of bumblebee pollination. Two types of pollen grains, namely round and fusiform pollen, were transported to a stigma by bumblebees and wind, but fusiform pollen contributed to wind pollination to a larger degree, especially in the marginal population. Our results suggest that wind pollination was enhanced by pollen dimorphism in the marginal population of A. gymnandrum, and wind pollination may provide reproductive assurance when bumblebee activity is unpredictable during range expansion, indicating that ambophily is stable in this species and shift in pollination system could be common when plants colonize new habitats.",2017

Here we investigated the evolution of extremely elongated forelegs in females of the South African bee genus Rediviva (Hymenoptera: Melittidae), in which long forelegs are hypothesised to be an adaptation for collecting oils from the extended spurs of their Diascia host flowers. We first reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus Rediviva using seven genes and inferred an origin of Rediviva at around 29 MYA (95% HPD = 19.2-40.5), concurrent with the origin and radiation of the Succulent Karoo flora. The common ancestor of Rediviva was inferred to be a short-legged species that did not visit Diascia. Interestingly, all our analyses strongly supported at least two independent origins of long legs within Rediviva. Leg length was not correlated with any variable we tested (ecological specialisation, Diascia visitation, geographic distribution, pilosity type) but seems to have evolved very rapidly. Overall, our results indicate that foreleg length is an evolutionary highly labile, rapidly evolving trait that might enable Rediviva bees to respond quickly to changing floral resource availability.",2017

Smith); ""YCA"") is known for its aggressive predatory ability and ability to exert exploitation competition on both native and other invasive ants via floral nectar. We argue that YCA invasion can exert both interference and exploitation competition on legitimate pollinators. In pumpkin fields (Cucurbita maxima L.) of south India, YCA infested the flowers, particularly the pistillate flowers, for nectar foraging. Pumpkin is a honey bee-mediated cross-pollinated monoecious plant that produces disproportionately very few pistillate flowers. We hypothesize that YCA presence in the flowers can affect the visitation rate and foraging time of honey bees in the flowers, the fruit set in pumpkins, and can exert predatory pressure on the honey bees if the bees linger in ant-colonized flowers. Both YCA and honey bees preferred to forage on the limited pistillate flowers in the plants. After colonizing the flowers, YCA did not retreat for hours, even upon disturbance by competitors, such as honey bees. Both the visitation frequency and the foraging time of honey bees were drastically reduced in ant-colonized flowers, and none of the ant-colonized flowers developed into fruits, suggesting that the YCA exert both an ecological and evolutionary pressure on pumpkin. The ants preyed upon about 17% of the honey bees that lingered in ant-colonized flowers, and the time the bees spent foraging predicted the fate of the bees. Exploitation competition exerted by the YCA on pumpkin may have far-reaching consequences for the pollination and productivity of this cash crop.",2017
The use of digital video recorders in pollination biology,Action camera; Apis mellifera; GoPro; pollination biology; pollinator observations; remote monitoring,CONSERVATION; VISITATION; DECLINES; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; PLANTS; BEES,"1. Digital video recording (DVR) devices, such as the GoPro Hero, have the potential to greatly benefit pollination ecology, but the advantages of digitally recording pollinator activity over direct human observation have not been formally assessed. 2. Two plant taxa, Lavandula angustifolia and Canna 'sp.', with differing floral morphology, were used to compare the value of DVR and direct observations in estimating honeybee (Apis mellifera) visitation, flower density and number of flowers visited per foraging bout. 3. The two methods yielded identical results when observing the structurally simple L. angustifolia at both high (10.54 +/- 0.52 per plant) and low honeybee density (2.24 +/- 0.20 per plant). However, DVR underestimated the number of flowers scored in the field of view (28.7 +/- 1.8 direct vs. 22.7 +/- 0.9 DVR), the number of honeybees observed (5.3 +/- 0.8 direct vs. 3.7 +/- 0.7 DVR) and the number of flowers visited during foraging bouts (8.3 +/- 1.2 direct vs. 5.5 +/- 1.0 DVR) on the more complex Canna 'sp.' 4. It is concluded that portable weatherproof DVR devices such as the GoPro Hero are valuable tools for pollination biologists, allowing a single researcher to make simultaneous observations of multiple plants in one or more sites, whilst also allowing the footage to be reviewed. However, DVR devices are limited by their depth and field of view when target plants are large or structurally complex.",2017

Here, we analyse the possible roles of insects and wind on the pollination of this species to establish whether the species is ambophilous. We carried out observations of floral biology, as well as on the frequency and behaviour of pollinators visiting flowers in a population of T.gardneriana in the Chaco vegetation of Brazil. We conducted experimental pollinations to determine the maternal fertility of female plants and whether they were pollen-limited, and we also conducted aerobiological experiments to provide evidence of how environmental factors influence atmospheric pollen dispersal. The population comprised an area of approximately 152.000m(2) and was composed of 603 female and 426 male plants (sex ratio=0.59:0.41). We observed 48 species of insects visiting flowers of T.gardneriana, of which the bees Scaptotrigona depilis and Apis mellifera scutellata were the most effective pollinators. We recorded pollen grains dispersed by wind on 74% of the glass slides placed on females, located at different distances (1-10m) from male plants. Airborne pollen concentration was negatively correlated with relative humidity and positively correlated with temperature. Our observations and experimental results provide the first evidence that T.gardneriana is an ambophilous species, with pollen dispersal resulting from both animal and wind pollination. This mixed pollination strategy may be adaptive in T.gardneriana providing reproductive assurance during colonisation of sites with different biotic and abiotic conditions.",2017

However, environmental change may re-organise network structure limiting capacity to absorb or resist shocks and increasing species extinctions. We investigated if habitat disturbance and the level of mutualism dependence between species affected the robustness of insect-flower visitation networks Following a recently developed Stochastic Co-extinction Model (SCM), we ran simulations to produce the number of extinction episodes (cascade degree), which we correlated with network structure in undisturbed and disturbed habitat. We also explicitly modelled whether a species' intrinsic dependence on mutualism affected the propensity for extinction cascades in the network. Habitat disturbance generated a gradient in network structure with those from disturbed sites being less connected, but more speciose and so larger. Controlling for network size (z-score standardisation against the null model) revealed that disturbed networks had disproportionately low linkage density, high specialisation, fewer insect visitors per plant species (vulnerability) and lower nestedness (NODF). This network structure gradient driven by disturbance increased and decreased different aspects of robustness to simulated plant extinction. Disturbance decreased the risk that an initial insect extinction would follow a plant species loss. Although, this effect disappeared when network size and connectance were standardised, suggesting the lower connectance of disturbed networks increased robustness to an initial secondary extinction. However, if a secondary extinction occurred then networks from disturbed habitat were more prone to large co-extinction cascades, likely resulting from a greater chance of extinction in these larger, speciose networks. Conversely, when species mutualism dependency was explicit in the SCM simulations the disturbed networks were disproportionately more robust to very large co-extinction cascades, potentially caused by non-random patterns of interaction between species differing in dependence on mutualism. Our results showed disturbance altered the size and the distribution of interspecific interactions in the networks to affect their robustness to co-extinction cascades. Controlling for effects due to network size and the interspecific variation in demographic dependence on mutualism can improve insight into properties conferring the structural robustness of networks to environmental changes.

Maximizing their potential is likely to be of increasing importance to the human food supply. 2 We explored the potential of waggle dance data to determine the spatial ecology of honey bees sited in a crop under commercial pollination. Over two springs, we video recorded and then decoded 834 waggle dances from colonies located in two apple and pear farms in Kent, U.K. We also obtained pollen samples from returning foragers and quantified the insects visiting apple and pear flowers. 3 The vast majority (84%) of dances were for locations outside of the orchards in which our colonies were located. Accounting for the distance of orchards and oilseed rape fields from the study colonies, the amount of foraging per hectare in oilseed rape fields was greater than in orchards. 4 The results of the present study indicate that maximizing the pollination services of managed honey bee colonies requires an landscape level approach that takes into account farm and foraging scale, as well as competing floral sources. The data also suggest that oilseed rape is a significant competitor to apple and pear flowers for honey bee visits.",2017

However, whether and how floral traits are involved in a mating system shift requires further investigation. A widely distributed and bumblebee-pollinated lousewort, Pedicularis siphonantha D. Don was studied. We investigated pollination systems, reproductive success, and floral traits in four large populations growing from 3200m to 4300m. Pollinator activity in low altitude populations was lower and these populations had a decreased fruit set and seed number per capsule compared to populations at high altitudes. Supplemental hand pollination with outcross pollen significantly increased seed production per capsule for plants from high altitudes but not for those from lower altitudes. We also found that bumblebees visited more flowers within an inflorescence in a single foraging bout in high altitudes compared with low altitudes, which caused a high possibility of geitonogamous mating. These differences may be pollination-dependent rather than inheritance-based because hand pollination on bagged flowers did not cause a difference in seed production across populations. Compared to plants from low altitudes, high-altitude plants had increased flower longevity, larger floral displays, higher pollen production per flower, and shorter corolla tubes, which were found to be well in accordance with changes in both pollination environment and mating system. Plasticity in floral traits might help plants to adjust their resource allocation strategies in response to their habitat, which might be linked with pollination environment. The variability among these populations might be beneficial for this widely distributed species to cope with environmental changes.",2017

This issue may be critical for pollination and seed dispersal, which determine natural regeneration. The mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus is almost exclusively pollinated by a hummingbird (Sephanoides sephaniodes) and dispersed by a marsupial (Dromiciops gliroides). We examined the extent to which human-induced habitat change and resource availability influence the interaction rate of this plant-pollinator-seed disperser system, along a forest transformation gradient (from native forest to exotic plantations). We estimated visitation rates of S. sephaniodes and D. gliroides on 70 T. corymbosus mistletoes using camera traps. We related visitation rates to habitat structural features and resource availability (flowers and fruits of the mistletoe and the neighborhood) using spatially explicit models. Sephanoides sephaniodes and D. gliroides visitation rates responded positively to shrub and bamboo cover, moss abundance, and mistletoe spatial arrangement. Pollination and seed dispersal interactions were sensitive to the flower and fleshy-fruit neighborhoods, being variable across months. Further, D. gliroides showed a non-random spatial association with fleshy-fruited plants. A larger sunlight incidence on disturbed habitats may prevent the disruption of key ecological interactions by increasing resource availability. This effect would result from the presence of shade-intolerant plants, which are benefited by sunlight exposure. Patches of disturbed habitat may enhance landscape heterogeneity, providing complementary resources to the native remnants.",2017

Animal-pollinated flowers advertise their rewards using modalities such as scent, color and morphology. In EFNs the role of olfactory and visual traits is less well understood. Herbivory has been shown to induce changes in the multimodal display and in resource related characteristics of flowers and EFNs. This may consequently affect the behavior of nectar consumers such as pollinators that occasionally feed on extrafloral nectar in addition to floral nectar. We tested the effect of herbivory (simulated by jasmonic acid treatment) on olfactory, visual and resource related floral and EFN traits in Vicia faba, tracked alterations in bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) preference and evaluated potential outcomes for plant reproduction. In control plants, flowers and EFNs differed in olfactory and visual cues and also in nectar quantity and quality and pollinators clearly preferred to forage on flowers. After jasmonic acid treatment (JA), linalool emissions of EFNs increased in a large proportion of plants, the visual display of EFNs became more salient and nectar volumes increased. In flowers of JA-treated plants we found lower emissions of cinnamic aldehyde and lower sugar concentration in nectar, however visual cues were unaffected. Potentially because of these phenotypic changes bumblebees no longer preferred flowers over EFNs in JA-treated plants. Consequently, this may negatively affect reproductive success in V. faba, which is highly dependent on floral visitation for fruit set. Our study adds another aspect to the complexity of plant-pollinator interactions and reveals how herbivory may interfere with plant-pollinator communication. Our findings emphasize that the foraging behavior of pollinators not only depends on floral traits, but is affected by the whole plants' multimodal phenotype.",2017
Temporal niche overlap and distinct bee ability to collect floral resources on three species of Brazilian Malpighiaceae,Centridini; environmental conditions; oil-collecting bees; pollinator efficiency; sequential flowering,OIL-FLOWERS; NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE; POLLINATION NETWORKS; FORAGING ACTIVITY; NATURAL-HISTORY; SOLITARY BEES; BODY-SIZE; HYMENOPTERA; COMPETITION; MORPHOLOGY,"Spatial and temporal limited resource and niche overlap studies have been widely used to explain resource-sharing in community ecology. Furthermore, morphological and behavioral differences among species are relevant to predict how they may share niche availabilities. We evaluated temporal niche overlap and the ability of visitors to collect floral resources on three Malpighiaceae species in the Brazilian savannah. We hypothesized: (I) an overlap between the temporal niches due the similarities between their floral resources requirements and the temporal limitation of flowering; and (II) a differential ability of bee species in resource harvesting. The 31 floral visitor species exhibited a higher niche overlap than expected by chance, confirming our first hypothesis. Furthermore, according to our second hypothesis, we observed that floral visitors showed a different efficiency in resource collection, depending on bee size and behavior. We believe that this may be a proxy of pollination efficiency. Our discussion is based on the distinct specialization of oil-collecting abilities and the specific requirements of each bee tribe.",2017
Flower visitation by European birds offers the first evidence of interaction release in continents,bird-flower interactions; ecological niche; ecological release; mutualistic networks; pollen transport; resource opportunity; rewiring; trophic niche,PLANT-HUMMINGBIRD NETWORK; ECOLOGICAL RELEASE; MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; SEED DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; MATRICES; WEB; DESCRIPTORS; POPULATION,"AimAll species are imbedded in a network of interactions with other species, which define an important component of their ecological niche. These interactions are dynamic and can change the emergence of vacant niches in the environment. Niche adjustments have been predicted to be particularly common on insular communities as a response to the poor and disharmonic biota of oceanic island - the interaction release hypothesis, however, the phenomena has not yet been reported on continents. Taxonomic groups of specialized nectarivorous birds are present on all continents except in Europe where they became extinct in the Oligocene, likely leaving behind underexplored flower resources. We performed the first community-level assessment of flower visitation by European birds to evaluate if insectivorous and granivorous birds show an interaction release towards consuming flower resources in Europe. LocationLarcA - Coimbra, Portugal, Europe. methods during one year, we collected pollen loads from the forehead of 634 birds. Pollen loads were prepared by acetolysis and all pollen grains were identified under a microscope. All interactions were compiled into a quantitative interaction matrix describing the first pollen-transport network by European birds. results one-fifth of the bird individuals, corresponding to two thirds of the bird species sampled carried pollen from 45 different types. The vast majority of the plant species found were native but the alien Eucalyptus globulus was by far the species most commonly found in the birds' pollen loads. Overall, the structure of the pollen-transport network from Europe shared many attributes of other networks that include taxonomic groups of specialized nectarivorous birds. Main conclusions we show that the interaction release hypothesis is not exclusive to insular communities but can also be observed in continents, greatly increasing the potential geographical distribution of this phenomenon. However, it seems considerably less pronounced in Europe than in the Galapagos, where it was first described, probably due to the much stronger selective pressures on the simplified ecosystems of oceanic islands.",2017

The various elaborations of corolla tube attributes, such as length, width and curvature, have enabled plants to exploit many specialized pollinator groups. These elaborations often differ dramatically among closely related species, contributing to pollinator shift and pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation and speciation. However, very little is known about the genetic and developmental control of these corolla tube attributes. center dot Here we report the characterization of a semi-dominant mutant in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii, with a substantial decrease in corolla tube width but no change in tube length. This morphological alteration leads to a similar to 70% decrease in bumblebee visitation rate for the homozygous mutant compared to the wild-type. center dot Through bulk segregant analysis and transgenic experiment, we show that the mutant phenotype is caused by a dominant-negative mutation in an actin gene. This mutation decreases epidermal cell width but not length, and probably also reduces the number of lateral cell divisions. center dot These results suggest a surprising potential role for a 'housekeeping' gene in fine-tuning the development of an ecologically important floral trait.",2017

However, not all floral visitors actually transfer pollen, and efforts to distinguish true pollinators from mere visitors are particularly scarce among the bat pollination literature. To determine whether Old World bat species are equally effective pollinators in mixed-agricultural areas of southern Thailand, we examined six night-blooming plant taxa and quantified pollinator importance (PI) of seven common nectarivorous bat species. PI was calculated as the product of nightly bat visitation rate (obtained from mist-netting data) and pollen transfer efficiency (estimated from bat pollen loads). We found that PI varied by both bat species and plant species. In general, the nectar-specialist bat species were more important pollinators, yet their order of importance differed across our focal plant species. In addition, PI was dictated more by pollen transfer effectiveness than visitation rate. Our findings highlight the importance of Old World bat pollinators within southern Thailand's mixed-agricultural landscape and illustrate how seemingly similar floral visitors can have very different contributions toward plant pollination success.

Plants have evolved inducible resistance and tolerance mechanisms against insect herbivores. Resistance mechanisms that affect herbivorous insects directly can be effective against generalist herbivores, but will not deter specialist herbivores from attacking the plant. Tolerance mechanisms and indirect plant resistance are more likely effective strategies used by plants when dealing with specialist herbivores. However, inducible indirect resistance and tolerance mechanisms have rarely been investigated within the same study system. 2. We studied multiple tolerance mechanisms and the role of natural enemies in reducing fitness loss of Brassica nigra plants incurred by feeding by the specialist herbivore Pieris brassicae. For this, we measured the changes in carbon and nitrogen triggered by herbivore attack and quantified plant biomass and seed production under field conditions, in the presence or absence of natural enemies of the herbivores. We also assessed whether B. nigra increased selfing rates when exposed to herbivore infestation, and investigated whether infestation by P. brassicae rendered B. nigra plants more attractive to night-active pollinators than control plants. 3. We found that B. nigra flowers are rarely visited by insects during the night, and exposure to herbivores did not influence selfing rates. Brassica nigra plants compensated for herbivory in terms of vegetative biomass. Seed set was negatively affected by herbivory in the absence of natural enemies, but not in the presence of natural enemies. Plants responded to herbivory with drastic changes in nitrogen contents of leaves and flowers, whereas no changes in carbon concentrations were detected. 4. The investment in reproduction or re-growth of vegetative tissues is not sufficient to sustain plant fitness. Reproductive output of flowering mustard plants is only sustained when interactions with the natural enemies of the herbivores are preserved. We conclude that natural enemies of herbivorous insects play an important role as component of the plant's defence strategy. This study reveals that both tolerance and indirect resistance are strategies of this plant species to sustain fitness.",2017
Rediscovery of the mistletoe Bakerella hoyifolia subsp bojeri (Loranthaceae) on Reunion Island: population status assessment for its conservation,Mistletoe; Loranthaceae; Bakerella; seed dispersal; bird pollination; Island conservation; Mascarene Islands; extinction,DIET; POLLINATION; MADAGASCAR; DISPERSAL; MAURITIUS; WOODLANDS; ECOLOGY; RUFUS,"The mistletoe Bakerella hoyifolia subsp. bojeri (Baker) Balle was presumed extinct from Reunion Island, where it is native, for over 50 years. We recently found B. hoyifolia plants in a wellpreserved forest stand in the southeastern part of the island. The small population consists of six individuals, distributed in two groups, ca. 50 m apart, growing on five host plant species from different families, suggesting a low host specificity. Each group is structured vertically with a large mistletoe established on an emerging tree while smaller mistletoes are seen on the trees below. Moreover, we observed the Reunion grey white-eye, Zosterops borbonicus (J. R. Forster, 1781) visiting flowers of these mistletoes found on Reunion. Further investigations are required in order to clarify the genetic isolation and taxonomic position of this population relative to those in Mauritius and Madagascar, and the mechanisms that have caused its decline on Reunion. Two possible mechanisms are discussed. The loss of most frugivorous vertebrates on Reunion Island soon after human settlement, may have driven this mistletoe to extinction. Among rapid conservation actions, propagation from seeds should be carried out in order to prevent the extinction of this native plant population.",2017
The Diet of the Cave Nectar Bat (Eonycteris spelaea Dobson) Suggests it Pollinates Economically and Ecologically Significant Plants in Southern Cambodia,Nectarivorous bats; Caves; Plant pollination; Mangrove; Durian; Cambodia,THAILAND; ECOLOGY; CONSERVATION; CHIROPTERA; TREE,"The importance of the cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea as a pollinator of economically significant crops and ecologically important plant species is increasingly documented, although information on the plants visited by this widely distributed bat species is currently confined to Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. We undertook a dietary study on E. spelaea by sampling faecal rain produced by a colony in Kampot, southern Cambodia each month for one year and identifying plant taxa visited by the bats by their pollen. Our results indicate the diet of E. spelaea in Cambodia includes at least 13 plant taxa, eight of which were identified to genus or species. Pollen of Sonneratia spp. and Musa spp. had the highest mean monthly frequency at 30.9% and 16.9% respectively, followed by Oroxylum indicum (11.3%), Bombax anceps (11.2%), Parkia spp. (9.8%), Durio zibethinus (6.3%), Ceiba pentandra (6.0%) and Eucalyptus spp. (0.3%). With one exception, all of the plant taxa recorded at our study site are also visited by the bat species in Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, although their relative dietary contributions differ. This variation likely reflects local differences in the availability, proximity and flowering phenology of chiropterophilous plants between regions, but also suggests a reliance of Cambodian bats on species that flower continuously, coupled with periodic shifts to species that flower profusely for short periods. Only three significant colonies (> 1,000 bats) of cave-roosting pteropodids are currently known in Cambodia, all of which are in Kampot and threatened by bushmeat hunting and roost disturbance. We recommend public education and law enforcement efforts to conserve these colonies, not least because Kampot is the premier region for Cambodian durian and this crop depends on nectarivorous bats for fruit set. Protection of mangroves would also benefit durian farmers because these are an important resource for nectarivorous bat populations.",2017

To establish which of these processes are most important in the lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton; Ericaceae) agroecosystem, an agent-based simulation model, Grid-Set-Match, with temporal and spatial elements was constructed using the R software package. Pollination ecology data from this system were used to parameterize the model. Then, results from 1,000 iterations of the model were compared to field fruit set data from a survey of 162 lowbush blueberry fields from 1993 to 2015 as well as from a field study conducted from 2013 to 2015. Predicted fruit set for an average lowbush blueberry field was 0.366 according to Grid-Set-Match. Based on currently available field data, this estimate appears realistic, although it may be a slight underestimate in part because variability in pollinator densities between real fields is higher than the model accounted for. A multiple regression model indicated that, across a sample of clones created by Grid-Set-Match under default parameter settings, fruit set declined significantly as the average genetic load of a clone's neighbors increased and as self-pollination rate increased, with the latter effect being 20% stronger than the former. As such, future research should be directed towards understanding and better managing factors that may influence rates of self- vs. cross-pollination in this system, such as pollen carryover, intra-hive pollen transfer, and pollinator flight distances between consecutively visited flowers.

Using an 8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant-pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly - predicts. Instead, we suggest assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.",2017
Importance of birds versus insects as pollinators of the African shrub Syncolostemon densiflorus (Lamiaceae),bird pollination; pollen deposition; pollinator effectiveness; pollinator importance; seed set; single visits; specialization; visitation frequency,FLORAL TRAITS; PENSTEMON-PSEUDOSPECTABILIS; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; POLLEN THEFT; PLANT; BEES; VISITORS,"Flowers visited by a broad assemblage of animals may nevertheless be considered to have a specialized pollination system if pollen deposition is effected mainly by a subset of these visitors. The importance of a particular animal group for pollination derives mainly from the relative rate of floral visitation and per-visit effectiveness for pollen deposition. We assessed the relative importance of birds and insects for pollination of the African shrub Syncolostemon densiflorus (Lamiaceae). Flower visitors were observed to evaluate their visitation rates. Virgin flowers were exposed to single visits by nine animal visitor groups to evaluate their effectiveness at depositing pollen on stigmas. We selectively excluded birds and larger insects from flowers to assess the contribution of smaller visitors to pollen deposition and seed set. Sunbirds and insects visited flowers at a similar frequency, but on a per-visit basis, sunbirds deposited more pollen on stigmas than did any of the insect groups, including honeybees, long-proboscid flies, butterflies and day-flying hawkmoths. Selective exclusion of birds and larger insects resulted in a large decline in pollen deposition on stigmas and seed production. These results show that S. densiflorus is pollinated mainly by sunbirds, despite its attraction of a broad assemblage of insect flower visitors. These findings highlight the importance of per-visit pollination effectiveness and selective exclusion for understanding the ecological importance of different flower visitors.",2017

Pollen deposited in the bees' transport organs is lost for the flowers' pollination. It has been hypothesised that specific body areas, bees cannot groom, serve as 'safe sites' for pollen transfer between flowers. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrated the position, area and pollen amount of safe sites at the examples of Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris by combining artificial contamination of the bees' body with pine or sunflower pollen and the subsequent bees' incomplete grooming. We found safe sites on the forehead, the dorsal thorax and waist, and on the dorsal and ventral abdomen of the bees. These areas were less groomed by the bees' legs. The largest amount of pollen was found on the waist, followed by the dorsal areas of thorax and abdomen. At the example of Salvia pratensis, S. officinalis and Borago officinalis, we experimentally demonstrated with fluorescent dye that the flowers' pollen-sacs and stigma contact identical safe sites. These results confirm that pollen deposition on the bees' safe sites improves pollen transfer to stigmas of conspecific flowers sti.

Information on their reproductive biology is crucial, but few studies are available. Ferocactus recurvus subsp. recurvus is a barrel cactus endemic to the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley. Our research aimed to characterise its floral and pollination biology. We hypothesised bee pollination, as suggested by its floral morphology and behaviour, and self-incompatibility, like most barrel cacti studied. Three study sites were selected in the semiarid Zapotitlan Valley, Mexico. We examined 190 flowers from 180 plants to determine: morphometry and behaviour of flowers, flower visitors and probable pollinators, and breeding system. Flowers showed diurnal anthesis, lasting 2-5 days, the stigma being receptive on day 2 or 3 after the start of anthesis. Flowers produced scarce/no nectar and main visitors were bees (Apidae), followed by flies ( Muscidae), ants (Formicidae), thrips (Thripidae) and hummingbirds (Throchilidae); however, only native bees and occasionally wasps contacted the stigma and anthers. Pollination experiments revealed that this species is self-incompatible and xenogamous. In natural conditions, fruit set was 60% and cross-pollination fruit set was 100%. Percentage seed germination resulting from cross-pollination was higher than in the control treatment. Our results provide ecological information for conservation programmes to ensure a high probability of breeding and seed production in natural populations of F. recurvus.",2017

From November 2013 to June 2016, we examined the foraging preferences of these hummingbirds using a combination of direct observations, time-lapse cameras, and motion-detection software. We first identified 21 species of ornithophilous plants distributed among five sites in the northwestern flanks of the Pichincha volcano in northwest Ecuador. We then monitored these plant species using time-lapse cameras and recorded 144 visits by Black-breasted Pufflegs to seven of the 21 species. Most visits (128 of 144 visits, 89%) were to just two species of plants, Macleania rupestris and Palicourea fuchsioides, the latter of which is also an endemic and threatened species. In addition, Black-breasted Pufflegs were only observed in the most pristine habitats. Given the potential negative effects of climate change for species in the tropical Andes plus the possible loss and degradation of habitat resulting from human activities, efforts are needed to conserve habitats currently used by Black-breasted Pufflegs, recover degraded habitats, and connect isolated patches of suitable habitat. Our results concerning species of flowering plants used most by Black-breasted Pufflegs (P.fuchsioides and M.rupestris) should help guide any habitat restoration initiatives.",2017

However, inferences about likely pollinators from `pollination syndromes' can be problematic due to trait overlap among some syndromes and unusual floral architecture in some lineages. An example is the rare South African parasitic plant Mystropetalon thomii (Mystropetalaceae), which has highly unusual brush-like inflorescences that exhibit features of both bird and rodent pollination syndromes. We used camera traps to record flower visitors, quantified floral spectral reflectance and nectar and scent production, experimentally determined self-compatibility and breeding system, and studied pollen dispersal using fluorescent dyes. The dark-red inflorescences are usually monoecious, with female flowers maturing before male flowers, but some inflorescences are purely female (gynoecious). Inflorescences were visited intensively by several rodent species that carried large pollen loads, while visits by birds were extremely rare. Rodents prefer male-over female-phase inflorescences, likely because of the male flowers' higher nectar and scent production. The floral scent contains several compounds known to attract rodents. Despite the obvious pollen transfer by rodents, we found that flowers on both monoecious and gynoecious inflorescences readily set seed in the absence of rodents and even when all flower visitors are excluded. Our findings suggest that seed production occurs at least partially through apomixis and that M. thomii is not ecologically dependent on its rodent pollinators. Our study adds another species and family to the growing list of rodent-pollinated plants, thus contributing to our understanding of the floral traits associated with pollination by non-flying mammals.",2017

Yet effects of encroachment on pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and accounts for up to 25% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing.",2017
Sugar landscapes and pollinator-mediated interactions in plant communities,,MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM; SHARED POLLINATORS; RESOURCE ABUNDANCE; SOUTHERN-AFRICA; COEXISTENCE; DENSITY; ECOLOGY; ENERGETICS; HUMMINGBIRDS; ENVIRONMENT,"Pollinator-mediated interactions between plants can play an important role for the dynamics of plant communities. Pollination services depend on the abundance and the foraging behaviour of pollinators, which in turn respond to the availability and distribution of floral resources (notably nectar sugar). However, it is still insufficiently understood how the 'sugar landscapes' provided by flowering plant communities shape pollinator-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and across different spatial scales. A better understanding of pollinator-mediated interactions requires an integrative approach that quantifies different aspects of sugar landscapes and investigates their relative importance for pollinator behaviour and plant reproductive success. In this study, we quantified such sugar landscapes from individual-based maps of Protea shrub communities in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. The 27 study sites of 4 ha each jointly comprise 127 993 individuals of 19 species. We analysed how rates of visitation by key bird pollinators and the seed set of plants respond to different aspects of sugar landscapes: the distribution of nectar sugar amounts, as well as their quality, taxonomic purity and phenology. We found that pollinator visitation rates strongly depended on phenological variation of site-scale sugar amounts. The seed set of focal plants increased with nectar sugar amounts of conspecific neighbours and with site-scale sugar amounts. Seed set increased particularly strongly if site-scale sugar amounts were provided by plants that offer less sugar per inflorescence. These combined effects of the amount, quality, purity and phenological variation of nectar sugar show that nectar sugar is a common interaction currency that determines how multiple plant species interact via shared pollinators. The responses of pollinator-mediated interactions to different aspects of this interaction currency alter conditions for species coexistence in Protea communities and may cause community-level Allee effects that promote extinction cascades.",2017
Distasteful Nectar Deters Floral Robbery,,HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; DISPLAY SIZE; BUMBLE-BEES; RANUNCULACEAE; ALKALOIDS; REWARDS; DEFENSE; FITNESS,"Toxic nectar is an ecological paradox [1, 2]. Plants divert substantial resources to produce nectar that attracts pollinators [3], but toxins in this reward could disrupt the mutualism and reduce plant fitness [4]. Alternatively, such compounds could protect nectar from robbers [2], provided that they do not significantly alter pollinator visitation to the detriment of plant fitness [1, 5-8]. Indeed, very few studies have investigated the role of plant toxins in nectar for defense against nectar robbers [4, 9, 10]. Here, we compared two Aconitum species (A. napellus and A. lycoctonum) that have flowers specialized for long-tongued bumblebee pollinators (Bombus hortorum) but are occasionally robbed by short-tongued bumblebees (B. terrestris) [6, 11-13]. Pollinator visits to flowers were much more frequent than by robbers, but visits correlated negatively with nectar alkaloid concentration and declined sharply between 200 and 380 ppm. However, alkaloid concentrations of >20 ppm were deterrent to B. terrestris, suggesting that robbers were less tolerant of nectar alkaloids. Nectar of both plant species contained similar concentrations of carbohydrates and toxic alkaloids, but A. lycoctonum was more likely to secrete nectar in each flower and was also visited more frequently by pollinators and robbers. We conclude that alkaloids in Aconitum spp. nectar affect rates of both pollinator visitation and robbery but may have co-evolved with nectar availability to maintain the fitness benefits of specialized plantpollinator relationships. Chemical defense of nectar is, however, ultimately constrained by pollinator gustatory sensitivity.",2017

We measured pollination benefits to yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25, 50, 100%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization (from 0 to 150 kg N ha(-1)) in an experiment under realistic soil field conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by approximately 25% compared with complete pollinator exclusion. Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were reduced by 50%, indicating that the incremental contribution of pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems. In particular, we found optimal level of pollination to potentially compensate for lower N applications.",2017

The ability of pollinating insects to discover and evade their predators can affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and have cascading ecosystem effects. Pollinators will avoid flowers with predators, but it is not clear how far away they will move to continue foraging. If these distances are relatively small, the impact of predators on the plant-pollinator mutualism may be lessened. The plant could continue to receive some pollination, and pollinators would reduce the time and energy needed to search for another patch. 2. A native crab spider, Xysticus elegans, was placed on one cluster in a small array of Baccharis pilularis inflorescence clusters, and the preferred short-range foraging distances of naturally visiting pollinators was determined. 3. Nearly all pollinator taxa (honey bees, wasps, other Hymenoptera, and non-bombyliid flies) spent less time foraging on the predator cluster. 4. The key result of this study is that inflorescences within 90 mm of the crab spider were avoided by visiting honey bees and wasps, which spent three-and 18-fold more time, respectively, foraging on more distant flower clusters. 5. Whether honey bees can use olfaction to detect spiders was then tested, and this study provides the first demonstration that honey bees will avoid crab spider odour alone at a food source.",2017
Volatility of network indices due to undersampling of intraspecific variation in plant-insect interactions,Community ecology; Plant-pollinator network; Robustness; Specialization,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; POLLINATOR NETWORK; SPECIES RICHNESS; SEED-SET; SPECIALIZATION; INDIVIDUALS; BIODIVERSITY; TRAITS,"Appropriate sampling effort of interaction networks is necessary to extract robust indices describing the structure of species interactions. Here we show that time-invariant variation in the composition and diversity of interaction partners of plant individuals of the same species explains volatility in aggregate network statistics due to undersampling. Within a multi-species pollinator-plant interaction matrix, we replaced the interactions observed on multiple individuals of a single plant species (Sinapis arvensis, pooled interactions) with the plant-insect interactions observed on a single plant individual. In the resampling approach, we considered the interactions of 1 to 84 S. arvensis individuals in different combinations. For each resampled network, several commonly applied aggregated statistics were calculated to test how intraspecific variation affects the properties of a multi-species network. Our results showed that aggregate statistics are sensitive towards qualitative and quantitative intraspecific variation of flower-visitor interactions within a multi-species network, which may affect the ecological interpretation about the properties of a community. These findings challenge the robustness of commonly applied network indices, confirm the urge for a sufficient and representative sampling of interactions, and emphasize the significance of intraspecific variation in the context of communities and networks.",2017
Fire modulates the effects of introduced ungulates on plant-insect interactions in a Patagonian temperate forest,Berberis darwinii; Cattle; Patagonian forest; Plant-animal interactions; Post-fire,EARLY POSTFIRE REGENERATION; NORTHERN PATAGONIA; NATIVE PLANT; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; INVASIONAL MELTDOWN; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; LEAF DAMAGE,"Disturbances like biological invasions and fire may affect in unexpected ways plant-animal interactions. In northwestern Patagonia, introduced ungulates (cattle, horses and deers) are widespread and very common occupying more than 50% of forests and shrublands, widely affecting these habitats. In addition, fire play a major role in creating landscape patterns in this region. We evaluated whether fire modify the impacts of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions. In a mature forest (unburnt) and in an early post-fire area (burnt) we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyzed the impacts of introduced ungulates on insect herbivory, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation on Berberis darwinii, one of the most common understory shrub of temperate forests. We found that the effects of cattle on pollination and fruit set depended on the habitat condition (i.e. unburnt or burnt). Introduced ungulates in unburnt forest decreased fruit set through a reduction on pollinator visits. Conversely, introduced ungulates in burnt forest increased pollinator visits and flower production without affecting fruit set. On the other hand, damage patterns (herbivory and fruit/seed predation) were unaffected by cattle in both forests types. Either, low browsing pressure or induction of plant defences may explain our results. This study illustrates how modifications on biotic and abiotic conditions produced by fire may affect in complex ways the effect of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions.",2017
Appendicular origin and structure of the spur of Vochysiaceae flowers,Callisthene; nectar; nectarostomata; plant anatomy; Qualea; Salvertia; Vochysia,ORGANOPHYLETIC PERSPECTIVES; REMARKABLE NECTARIES; FLORAL DEVELOPMENT; CENTRAL BRAZIL; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; ANGIOSPERMS; POLLINATION; MORPHOLOGY; SECRETION,"Floral nectaries are linked with animal pollinators and floral specialization, characterizing some plant groups, such as the mostly Neotropical Vochysiaceae. The phylogeny of these plants has been revised based on molecular data, but their conspicuous spurs were mostly neglected. The appendicular or receptacular origin of these spurs has been discussed but without ontogenetic or anatomical study, and the association between spur structure and pollination systems was never assessed. We studied the spurs of species of four genera of Cerrado Vochysiaceae (tribe Vochysieae), documenting their vascularization and comparing their structure to previously described pollination systems. The spur structure was roughly similar among species, and vascularization confirmed their appendicular origin. Subepidermic secretory tissue surrounded the lumen of the spur and nectar was secreted through nectarostomata. Besides differences in size and cuticle striation, no other association between spur structure and pollination system was observed. However, the structure is somewhat distinct in Qualea parviflora, which sports a pluriseriate internal epidermis padding the spur lumen, which may provide protection against damage by the large bees that visit these relatively small flowers. The conservative histology and vasculature somewhat confirmed the monophyly of the tribe Vochysieae and the appendicular origin of the spur in the Cerrado Vochysiaceae.",2017

Erica lanuginosa, a Klein River Mountains (southern Overberg) endemic, has unusual pendulous, acorn-shaped flowers unlike those of a typical Erica as the lobes of the corolla are tightly pressed together at the tips to form a sharp closed ""beak"". These unusual floral traits suggested the possibility of autonomous self-pollination in flowers that don't open (cleistogamy) or rodent-pollination. We used digital camera traps, mammal trapping and pollinator exclusions to test these alternative hypotheses. We show that Erica lanuginosa, is pollinated by small mammals, the second documented rodent-pollinated Erica species. Camera traps recorded fourteen images of three species of rodents visiting flowers on seven separate days to three different plants, with the majority of visits by Acomys subspinosus. PVC Sherman-type traps were used to capture rodents and examine their scats for the presence of pollen. Pollen tetrads typical of Ericaceae were observed in droppings of all three species. Flowers of Erica lanuginosa covered with pollinator exclosure bags set no seeds while the proportion of open, control flowers that set seed was high, indicating that pollinators are essential for seed set in E. lanuginosa. These data are consistent with rodent-pollination in E. lanuginosa and there is no evidence for cleistogamy in this species.",2017
The role of the endemic and critically endangered Colorful Puffleg Eriocnemis mirabilis in plant-hummingbird networks of the Colombian Andes,Colombia; generalization; interaction diversity; Munchique National Park; network sampling; pollen load; pollination,POLLINATOR NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SEED-DISPERSAL; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; SPECIALIZATION; EXTRAPOLATION; PERSISTENCE; EXTINCTION; PATTERNS,"Ecological network approaches may contribute to conservation practices by quantifying within-community importance of species. In mutualistic plant-pollinator systems, such networks reflect potential pollination of the plants and a considerable portion of the energy consumption by the pollinators, two key components for each party. Here, we used two different sampling approaches to describe mutualistic plant-hummingbird networks from a cloud forest in the Colombian Western Andes, home to the Colorful Puffleg Eriocnemis mirabilis, an endemic and critically endangered hummingbird. We contrast networks between two localities (a protected area inside a National park vs. its buffer zone) and across sampling methods (floral visitation vs. pollen loads) to assess how the network structure and the importance of each hummingbird species within the networks may change. Visitation networks were characterized as having higher sampling completeness, yet pollen load network recorded more pollen types than plant species recorded by visitation. Irrespective of the sampling methods, the Colorful Puffleg was one of the most important hummingbird species in the network within the protected area inside the National park, but not in the buffer zone. Moreover, most species-level network indices were related to hummingbirds' abundance. This suggests that conservation initiatives aimed at the endangered Colorful Puffleg may both help on the survival of this endangered hummingbird, as well as on maintaining its key role in the mutualistic interaction network inside the National Park. Our study illustrates how conservation practitioners could assess the local importance of endangered species using interaction network approaches.",2017
Dispersal enhances beta diversity in nectar microbes,Community assembly; microbial ecology; nectar sugar composition; null model; pollination; priority effect; species turnover,MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; FLORAL NECTAR; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; HISTORICAL CONTINGENCY; MIMULUS-AURANTIACUS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; METACOMMUNITY; PATTERNS; YEASTS,"Dispersal is considered a key driver of beta diversity, the variation in species composition among local communities, but empirical tests remain limited. We manipulated dispersal of nectar-inhabiting bacteria and yeasts via flower-visiting animals to examine how dispersal influenced microbial beta diversity among flowers. Contrary to the prevailing view that dispersal lowers beta diversity, we found beta diversity was highest when dispersal was least limited. Our analysis suggested that this unexpected pattern might have resulted from stronger priority effects under increased dispersal. Dispersal is highly stochastic, generating variability in species arrival history and consequently the potential for community divergence via priority effects, in these and likely many other microbial, plant, and animal communities. Yet most previous experiments eliminated this possibility. We suggest that the positive effects of dispersal on beta diversity, like the one we report here, may have been greatly underappreciated.",2017

The plants attract the insects deceiving them and not delivering any reward. We are interested in analysing the effect of learning by the insect population due to unsuccessfully visiting the deceiving plants. We are especially interested in three elements: conditions for the simultaneous coexistence of both species, their extinction as a function of the biological cost of the deceptiveness for the pollinator, and the appearance of oscillations in the dynamics. We also look for conditions under which plants would be better off by switching to different strategies, in particular, we look for conditions for the existence and stability of the equilibria of the corresponding differential equations system, and the conditions for the existence of periodic solutions.",2017

Little is reported on the pollination chemoecology of Stevia rebaudiana (Asteraceae), a hermaphroditic species producing self-incompatible florets in small corymbs. We investigated the chemistry of volatiles potentially involved in its pollination system. The VOCs emitted by the corymbs of 27 F1 open-pollinated genotypes were collected by solid-phase micro-extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), as well as morphometric data of the genotypes were recorded. Finally, we quantified the abundance of pollinators for each genotype. S. rebaudiana flowers were mainly visited by bees (Apidae and Halictidae), followed by hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). GC-MS indicated that S. rebaudiana was characterized by a complex scent profile with large variability among F1 plants. Discriminant analysis showed that limonene, delta-elemene and bicyclogermacrene were the compounds explaining most of the scent bouquet difference between high attractive (> 40 pollinators/plant) from low attractive pollinator power (< 40 pollinators/plant). Limonene was the most representative VOC among plants that are more attractive to pollinators, while high emissions of delta-elemene and bicyclogermacrene were linked to plants that are less attractive to pollinators. S. rebaudiana morphometric data highlighted that, besides floral VOCs, corymb abundance and size, as well as plant height, may route pollinator visits. Overall, this study adds knowledge on floral phenology and pollinator ecological traits of S. rebaudiana, allowing a deeper understanding of its chemical ecology and pollination.",2017
Bee pollination and evidence of substitutive nectary in Anadenanthera colubrina (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae),Andromonoecy; Bee pollination; Caatinga; Generalist pollination; Seasonally dry tropical forests; Self-incompatibility,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL; FABACEAE; ECOLOGY; FOREST; ACACIA; EVOLUTION; PHENOLOGY; FLOWERS; HONEY,"Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae) is a widely-distributed tree in seasonally dry tropical forests of South America that was classified previously as lacking nectaries. However, some studies have stated that its flowers produce nectar, while others analyzed the composition of unifloral honey produced from A. colubrina flowers, raising the question about nectar production in the species. We studied the pollination and reproductive biology of A. colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul in a natural population in the Caatinga, northeastern Brazil. Reproductive phenology, sexual system, floral biology, resource, and pollinators were investigated. We analyzed the breeding system through controlled pollinations for addressing its dependence on pollen vectors for reproduction. Anadenanthera colubrina flowered in the dry season, flower heads are heteromorphic, with staminate flowers at the base and perfect flowers at the apex of the inflorescence, characterizing andromonoecy. Anthesis is diurnal. We observed small drops of nectar at the apex of the petals of some flowers per inflorescence. Together with observations on flower visitor behavior and histochemical tests, we propose that A. colubrina produces floral nectar at the apex of the corolla, characterizing a substitutive nectary (sensu Vogel). This is the first record of substitutive nectary in the Mimosoideae and the first record of andromonoecy in the genus. Bees were the main pollinators (higher frequency), although other insects such as wasps, butterflies, and small beetles were also observed collecting nectar and/or pollen. The species is self-incompatible, thus depending on insect pollen vectors, mainly bees, for reproduction.",2017
Interpopulation variation in pollinators and floral scent of the lady's-slipper orchid Cypripedium calceolus L.,Deceptive pollination; Electroantennography; Dynamic headspace; Pollinator climate,POPULATIONS; SELECTION; ODOR; RECOGNITION; ADAPTATION; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; GERMANY; FLOWERS,"Floral scent is a key mediator in many plant-pollinator interactions. It is known to vary not only among plant species, but also within species among populations. However, there is a big gap in our knowledge of whether such variability is the result of divergent selective pressures exerted by a variable pollinator climate or alternative scenarios (e.g., genetic drift). Cypripedium calceolus is a Eurasian deceptive lady's-slipper orchid pollinated by bees. It is found from near sea level to altitudes of 2500 m. We asked whether pollinator climate and floral scents vary in a concerted manner among different altitudes. Floral scents of four populations in the Limestone Alps were collected by dynamic headspace and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Flower visitors and pollinators (the subset of visitors with pollen loads) were collected and identified. Preliminary coupled gas chromatographic and electroantennographic measurements with floral scents and pollinators revealed biologically active components. More than 70 compounds were detected in the scent samples, mainly aliphatics, terpenoids, and aromatics. Although several compounds were found in all samples, and all samples were dominated by linalool and octyl acetate, scents differed among populations. Similarly, there were strong differences in flower visitor spectra among populations with most abundant flower visitors being bees and syrphid flies at low and high altitudes, respectively. Pollinator climate differed also among populations; however, independent of altitude, most pollinators were bees of Lasioglossum, Andrena, and Nomada. Only few syrphids acted as pollinators and this is the first record of flies as pollinators in C. calceolus. The electrophysiological tests showed that bees and syrphid flies sensed many of the compounds released by the flowers, among them linalool and octyl acetate. Overall, we found that both floral scent and visitor/pollinator climate differ among populations. We discuss whether interpopulation variation in scent is a result of pollinator-mediated selection.",2017
The behavioral ecology of nectar robbing: why be tactic constant?,,LINARIA-VULGARIS SCROPHULARIACEAE; FLOWER CONSTANCY; BUMBLE-BEES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; LEGITIMATE VISITORS; DYNAMICS; FITNESS; ROBBERS; POLLINATORS; REWARDS,"How do animals forage for variable food resources? For animals foraging at flowers, floral constancy has provided a framework for understanding why organisms visit some flowers while bypassing others. We extend this framework to the flower-handling tactics that visitors employ. Nectar robbers remove nectar through holes bitten in flowers, often without pollinating. Many foragers can switch between robbing and visiting flowers legitimately to gain access to nectar. We document that even though individuals can switch foraging tactics, they often do not. We explore whether individuals exhibit constancy to either robbing or visiting legitimately, which we term tactic constancy. We then extend hypotheses of floral constancy to understand when and why visitors exhibit tactic constancy and raise questions for future research.",2017

Most simulation models assume that network structure remains static after species losses, despite theoretical and empirical reasons to expect dynamic responses. We assessed the effects of experimental single bumblebee species removals on the structure of entire flower visitation networks. We hypothesized that network structure would change following processes linking interspecific competition with dietary niche breadth. We found that single pollinator species losses impact pollination network structure: resource complementarity decreased, while resource overlap increased. Despite marginally increased connectance, fewer plant species were visited after species removals. These changes may have negative functional impacts, as complementarity is important for maintaining biodiversity ecological functioning relationships and visitation of rare plant species is critical for maintaining diverse plant communities.",2017
Does hardness make flower love less promiscuous? Effect of biomechanical floral traits on visitation rates and pollination assemblages,Keel flowers; Force; Lever arm; Pollinator composition; Visitation rates; Canonical correspondence analysis,FUNCTIONAL-MORPHOLOGY; LEVER MECHANISM; KEEL FLOWERS; LAMIACEAE; BEHAVIOR; FABACEAE; DISPLAY; SIZE,"Visitation rates and assemblage composition of pollinators have often been related to environmental, ecological and phenotypic variables. However, the interaction between flowers and pollinators has not been evaluated in a biomechanical context. Floral rewards in keel flowers (Fabaceae, Faboideae) are concealed behind four joined petals, the keel-wing unit, and are accessible only if pollinators open this unit by exerting force on it. Force needed to open the flower is expected to affect the interaction with pollinators because pollinators must invest time and energy to open the keels. Consequently, plants with stiff flowers should be expected to experience diminished visitation frequency, particularly by weak visitors. To test this expectation of diminished visitation rates and of assemblage composition biased by pollinator strength, we measured the force needed to open the keel flowers of five co-occurring legume species and, using a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), we tested their association with pollinator visitation rates and assemblage composition. We additionally included a size flag variable in CCA to test the effect of attractiveness on pollinator visits. There was no association between flower stiffness and visitation frequency. According to the CCA, pollinator assemblage compositions were associated with the force needed to open the keel and not flag size. As a general pattern, weak flowers are pollinated by an uneven assemblage of weak bees while the stiffest flowers are pollinated by an even assemblage of large and strong bees. These results supports the idea that force has an effect in controlling pollinator assemblage composition.",2017
Bee visitors of Centaurea solstitialis L.

Herein, we document the visitation pattern of bees and explore the relationship of bee body size and nectar availability in weedy populations of C. solstitialis from an urban environment within its native range in northwestern Turkey. Studies were conducted at patches of C. solstitialis in abandoned lots at the Uludag University near the city of Bursa. A total of 41 species, including honey bees, belonging to five families and 19 genera were recorded. Small megachilid and halictid bee species were the most common visitors. Average nectar standing crop volume per floret was low (0.003-0.117 mu L) and did not significantly vary throughout the day. Average bee head width significantly correlated with average nectar standing crop volume but did not significantly change throughout the day. Analyses of pollen loads as well as direct observations of bee foraging behavior indicate that a large number of bees visit C. solstitialis, primarily in search of nectar while carrying a large percentage of pollen grains of this plant species on their bodies. These results are similar to previous observations on a non-weedy population of C. solstitialis from the island of Lesvos.",2017
Functional significance of petals as landing sites in fungus-gnat pollinated flowers of Mitella pauciflora (Saxifragaceae),fungus gnat; landing-site function; Mitella; pollination success; pollinator approach; visual attraction function,POLLEN TRANSFER; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS; SPECIALIZATION; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; DISPLAYS; IDENTITY; ECOLOGY,"Despite the well-known visual attraction function of angiosperm petals, additional roles of these floral organs (e.g. the provision of landing-site platforms for pollinators) have rarely been examined. This is likely because most petals perform multiple functions, making it difficult to isolate the importance of landing sites in pollination success. We investigated the landing-site function of dull-coloured pinnately branched petals in Mitella pauciflora flowers, which are predominantly pollinated by fungus gnats. We conducted a field experiment, in which the effects of experimental petal removal on pollinators' approach, landing and visit duration and floral reproductive success were examined in naturally pollinated flowers. According to direct and time-lapse camera observations, petal removal did not influence pollinators' approach frequency or visit duration, but did significantly decrease their landings. Fruit set and pollen dispatch both significantly decreased with petal removal, indicating that petals promote female and male reproductive success in M.pauciflora by facilitating pollinator landing. This demonstrates that inconspicuous petals primarily have a landing-site function rather than a visual attraction function in M.pauciflora. Discriminating between diverse petal functions is a challenging problem, and new approaches are required to elucidate the functional features of angiosperm flowers.

Behavioral repertoires and interactions between Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the native bee Lithurgus littoralis (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in flowers of Opuntia huajuapensis (Cactaceae) in the Tehuacan desert,honey bee; native bee; agonistic behavior; competition,INTRODUCED HONEY-BEES; FLORAL RESOURCE; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; FORAGING PATTERNS; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; SOUTHERN COLORADO; L. HYMENOPTERA; RAIN-FOREST; BUMBLE BEES,"The introduction of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L.

We described the behavioral repertoire and interactions between A. mellifera and the native bee Lithurgus littoralis Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on Opuntia huajuapensis Bravo (Cactaceae) flowers in a semiarid environment. We filmed the bees in 150 cactus flowers to obtain the diversity of behaviors and their durations and thereby quantify the interactions. The behavior accumulation curve (Clench model) showed differences in the behavioral repertoire between the 2 bee species and between the sexes of L. littoralis. We found that A. mellifera and L. littoralis females invested more time in feeding behavior than L. littoralis males and recorded a wider repertoire of agonistic behaviors in male compared with female bees. Native male bees often perched in flowers and were inactive for long periods. The results indicate a possible interference competition between native and non-native bee species that are visiting the flowers of O. huajuapensis.",2017

Species offering floral resin as a reward to pollinating bees often show unique androecial structures. We investigate the stamen structure of two groups of Clusia with resin flowers and anthers with numerous locelli: all the species of section Polythecandra and Clusia nigrolineata (Clusia section Cordylandra). In section Polythecandra the flowers have stamens with a short, thick filaments and anthers with numerous locelli (microsporangia) without thecal organization. When bees try to remove resin, in most species the whole anther detaches from the rest of the stamen and then dehisces in the detachment zone in areas where the cells have thinner cell walls, a unique mechanism. Stamens of C. nigrolineata also have numerous locelli and a broad and short filament, but pairs of locelli are disposed in two parallel series and the anthers show a clear thecal organization. We discuss the stamen characters in relation to the floral biology of the species and suggest that the athecal multilocellate anthers of section Polythecandra evolved to minimize contact of pollen with the sticky floral resin. The locellate anthers of C. nigrolineata, on the other hand, offer a resin-pollen mixture to flower visitors in the same way as other species of section Cordylandra with normal anthers. In this case, locelli might have evolved to cope up with the enlargement of the anthers compared to other species of the section. The difference in the organization of the anthers of C. nigrolineata and the species of section Polythecandra indicate that multilocellate anthers have evolved independently in these groups.",2017
Bee pollination in Syagrus orinocensis (Arecaceae) in the Colombian Orinoquia,Arecaceae; mellitophilia; pollinators efficient; pollination syndrome,RAIN-FOREST PALM; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; FRUITING PHENOLOGY; FLORAL BIOLOGY; BRAZIL; BEETLES; ECOLOGY; SYSTEM; FLOWER; AMAZON,"The pollination ecology of the Syagrus orinocensis was studied in the course of three consecutive yearly flowering seasons in a foothill forest in Casanare, Colombian Orinoco region. Syagrus orinocensis palms grow up to 10 m high and produce one to four bisexual, occasionally unisexual, inflorescences. The bisexual inflorescences bear staminate and pistillate flowers arranged in triads, whereas the unisexual inflorescences carry only staminate flowers in dyads. The inflorescences are protandric and open during daytime, remaining active for 26 days. The male phase extends for the first 15 days, which are followed by 8 days of an inactive phase; the pistillate phase lasts up to three days. The inflorescences of S. orinocensis were visited by 43 species of insects belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera. The presence of anthophilous insects was primarily restricted to the male phase of anthesis, during which the visitors searched for pollen and breeding sites; those which visited inflorescences during the female phase seeked out nectar. The most effective pollinators of S. orinocensis were stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini), as they transferred in average 83% of the pollen that reached receptive inflorescences. The presence, constancy and efficiency of stingless bees during this study constitute solid evidence of melittophily in S. orinocensis and allows us to propose criteria to redefine this pollination syndrome in Neotropical wild palms.",2017
The presence of aggressive ants is associated with fewer insect visits to and altered microbe communities in coffee flowers,Azteca; Community assembly; Coffea arabica; Chiapas; Mexico; Dispersal; Microbial ecology; Microbiome; Nectar chemistry,MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS; AGROFORESTRY MANAGEMENT; FLORAL NECTAR; BIODIVERSITY; YEASTS; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; FOREST; PLANT; POLLINATORS,"The process of dispersal can shape ecological communities, but its influence is thought to be small compared to the effects of environmental variation or direct species interactions, particularly for microbial communities. Ants can influence movement patterns of insects and the microbes they vector, potentially affecting microbial establishment on plants, including in agroecosystems. Here, we examine how the presence of aggressive ants, which can influence floral visitation by bees and other pollinators, shapes the community composition of bacteria and fungi on coffee flowers in farms that differ in shade management intensity. We hypothesized that the presence of aggressive ants should reduce the frequency and diversity of floral visitors. Finally, we predicted that the effects of ants should be stronger in the low-shade farm, which has a less diverse community of floral visitors. We sampled microbial communities from nectar and pistils of coffee flowers near and far from nests of the aggressive ant Azteca sericeasur across two farms that vary in shade management and diversity of floral visitors. Bacterial and fungal community composition was characterized using Illumina sequencing of the 16S and ITS regions of the rRNA gene. Consistent with our expectation, Azteca presence was associated with a decrease in the number and diversity of visitors, visit duration and number of flowers visited. Azteca presence influenced microbial communities, but effects differed between farms. Azteca nests were associated with higher bacterial diversity in both farms, but the difference between flowers on trees with and without Azteca was greater in the high-shade farm. Azteca nests were associated with higher fungal diversity in the high-shade farm, but not the low-shade farm. In addition, the presence of ants was strongly associated with species composition of fungi and bacteria in flowers, but differentiation between ant and no-ant communities was greater in the low-shade farm. Specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were differentially associated with the presence of ants. We conclude that indirect interactions that influence dispersal may have large effects on microbial community composition, particularly in ephemeral microbial communities.",2017
POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF LOWIACEAE (ZINGIBERALES): NOCTURNAL CARRION-BEETLE POLLINATION OF ORCHIDANTHA VIROSA,coprocantharophily; flowering phenology; Phaeochrous; Hybosoridae; Vietnam; Xuan Son National Park,FLORAL DEVELOPMENT; INOUEI LOWIACEAE; VIETNAM; ARACEAE; MAXILLARIOIDES; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; MALAYSIA; POLLEN; BORNEO,"Premise of research.Previous investigations showed the occurrence of diurnal dung-beetle pollination in Orchidantha (Lowiaceae). Though many dung, carrion, and scavenger beetles are exclusively nocturnal, comprehensive night observations were never performed for this genus. In addition, some small mammals were occasionally observed feeding on flowers of Orchidantha during the night. Thus, the present study of pollination biology with observations throughout night fills a significant gap in our knowledge of the ecology of these plants. Methodology.Pollination of O. virosa was studied using day and night visual observations as well as video and photo monitoring. Pollen grains, flowers, and captured pollinators were investigated using LM and SEM. Pivotal results.The flowers of O. virosa are visited by diurnal flies, ants, and nocturnal carrion beetles, together with many other occasional visitors. Among them, only the carrion beetles from the genus Phaeochrous were shown to carry pollen of O. virosa. Nocturnal pollination was documented for the genus Orchidantha for the first time. Conclusions.Our study confirms the occurrence of coprocantharophily in Orchidantha. Taking all the features together, we can assume the described type of pollination (nocturnal deceptive carrion-beetle pollination without floral traps) to be rare within beetle pollination. We briefly review the knowledge of reproductive ecology in the genus Orchidantha and propose diversity of pollination modes (nocturnal and diurnal) within the family.",2017
Pollinator diversity and reproductive success of Epipactis helleborine (L.) Crantz (Orchidaceae) in anthropogenic and natural habitats,Apophytes; Anthropogenic habitats; Natural habitats; Autogamy; Insect pollinators,FLORAL MORPHOLOGY; NICHE ANALYSIS; CENTRAL-EUROPE; CONSERVATION; SIZE; WASPS; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION; PALUSTRIS; ECOLOGY,"Background. Epipactis helleborine is an Eurasian orchid species which prefers woodland environments but it may also spontaneously and successfully colonise human-made artificial and disturbed habitats such as roadsides, town parks and gardens. It is suggested that orchids colonising anthropogenic habitats are characterised by a specific set of features (e.g., large plant size, fast flower production). However, as it is not well known how pollinator diversity and reproductive success of E. helleborine differs in populations in anthropogenic habitats compared to populations from natural habitats, we wanted to compare pollinator diversity and reproductive success of this orchid species between natural and anthropogenic habitat types. Methods. Pollination biology, reproductive success and autogamy in populations of E. helleborine from anthropogenic (roadside) and natural (forest) habitats were compared. Eight populations (four natural and four human-disturbed ones) in two seasons were studied according to height of plants, length of inflorescences, as well as numbers of juvenile shoots, flowering shoots, flowers, and fruits. The number and diversity of insect pollinators were studied in one natural and two human-disturbed populations. Results. Reproductive success (the ratio of the number of flowers to the number of fruits) in the populations from anthropogenic habitats was significantly higher than in the natural habitats. Moreover, plants from anthropogenic habitats were larger than those from natural ones. In both types of populations, the main insect pollinators were Syrphidae, Culicidae, Vespidae, Apidae and Formicidae. With respect to the type of pollinators' mouth-parts, chewing (39%), sponging (34%) and chewing-sucking (20%) pollinators prevailed in anthropogenic habitats. In natural habitats, pollinators with sponging (55%) and chewing mouth-parts (32%) dominated, while chewing-sucking and piercing-sucking insects accounted for 9% and 4% respectively. Discussion. We suggest that higher reproductive success of E. helleborine in the populations from anthropogenic habitats than in the populations from natural habitats may result from a higher number of visits by pollinators and their greater species diversity, but also from the larger size of plants growing in such habitats. Moreover, our data clearly show that E. helleborine is an opportunistic species with respect to pollinators, with a wide spectrum of pollinating insects. Summarising, E. helleborine is a rare example of orchid species whose current range is not declining. Its ability to make use of anthropogenically altered habitats has allowed its significant spatial range expansion, and even successful colonisation of North America.",2017
"Reproductive ecology of the threatened "" star cactus"" Astrophytum ornatum ( Cactaceae): a strategy of continuous reproduction with low success",continuous production of flower buds; reproductive success; breeding system; mating system; phenology,CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEMOGRAPHIC-ANALYSIS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; CENTRAL MEXICO; RARE; BIOLOGY; TEHUACAN; PLATYACANTHUS; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS,"Background: There are no previous studies on the reproductive biology of the endemic and endangered cactus species Astrophytum ornatum. Questions: Is flowering continuous or episodic? What are the breeding and mating systems and what floral visitors are associated? and Does the reproductive success change over time? Study species: Astrophytum ornatum nCactaceae). Study site and years of study: Observations from 2010 to 2011, in the highest density population of A. ornatum in MetztitlAn Canyon nHgo. Mexico). Methods: Monthly surveys and monitoring of reproductive structures. Tracking flowers in anthesis. Controlled pollinations to determine the mating system and determination of the Outcrossing Index nOCI), the pollen /ovule ratio and breeding system. Results: Astrophytum ornatum produced flower buds throughout the year, but 89.2% of them were aborted. Four events of ephemeral flowering population were presented per year. The species is self- incompatible and controlled pollinations indicated pollinator limitation of several bee species. The OCI indicates that the species is facultative xenogamous, and pollen/ovule ratio indicates obligate xenogamy. On average there were 54 seeds/fruit and individuals produced 4 fruits/year. Conclusions: The continuous production of buds had rarely been reported for cacti. Intrapopulation bloom is one of the shortest recorded for the family and it produces high floral synchrony. The low number of seeds /fruit and flowers /individual, coupled with the narrow niche breadth of species and various anthropogenic factors place Astrophytum ornatum as a susceptible species to be extinct.",2017
Most ornamental plants on sale in garden centres are unattractive to flower-visiting insects,Flower-visiting insects; Ornamental plants; Pollinators; Urban ecology; Wildlife-friendly gardening; Gardens,BIODIVERSITY; ATTRACTIVENESS; POLLINATORS; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESSION; VARIETIES; DRIVERS; HEALTH,"Background. Gardeners and park managers seeking to support biodiversity in urban areas often plant ornamentals attractive to flower-visiting insects. There is a huge diversity of garden plant varieties, and some recommendations are available as to which are attractive to insects. However, these are largely not based on rigorous empirical data. An important factor in consumer choice is the range of varieties available for purchase. In the UK, garden centres are a key link in the supply chain between growers and private gardens. This study is the first to determine the proportions of flowering ornamentals being sold that are attractive to flower-visiting insects. Methods. We surveyed six garden centres in Sussex, UK, each over two days in 2015, by making 12 counts of insects visiting patches of each ornamental plant on display for sale that was in bloom. To provide a consistent baseline among different locations, we brought with us and surveyed marjoram (Origanum vulgare) plants in pots, which are known to be attractive to a wide range of flower-visiting insects. The attractiveness of plant varieties to insects was then expressed in two ways: the absolute number and relative to that on marjoram (marjoram score'), both per unit area of plant cover. In addition, we noted whether each variety was recommended as pollinator-friendly either via a symbol on the label, or by being included in the Royal Horticultural Society's 'Perfect for Pollinators' list. Furthermore, we compared the attractiveness of plants that are typically grown for more than one year versus only one year. Results. We surveyed 59-74 plant varieties in bloom across the six garden centres. In each garden centre, the distributions of variety attractiveness were highly skewed to the right, with most varieties being relatively unattractive, and few varieties highly attractive to flower-visiting insects. The median attractiveness of varieties with a recommendation was 4.2x higher than that of varieties without. But, due to the large variation there was a substantial number of both poor varieties that had a recommendation and good varieties that did not. Median attractiveness of multi-year plants was 1.6x that of singleyear plants, with a similar overlap in distributions. Discussion. Our study demonstrates the practicality of carrying out plant surveys in garden centres. Garden centres display large numbers of varieties for sale, most of which are in bloom. Furthermore, data gathered in garden centres appear to correlate well with data gathered in two previous studies in Sussex for plants established in gardens. Although it is unclear whether the varieties being sold in garden centres are a fair representation of varieties that are actually grown by gardeners, our results suggest that there might be considerable scope for making parks and gardens considerably more insect-friendly through judicious variety choices.",2017

For example, the role of non-flying mammals in pollination is largely unknown in the Neotropical areas, despite the importance of this group in the pollination of plants in other regions. Here we report evidence for flower visitation by a rodent to Oreocallis grandiflora (Proteaceae) in our study site in the southern Andes of Ecuador. For a period of 241 h, camcorders equipped with infrared lights revealed 22 occurrences of floral visitation by Microryzomys altissimus (Cricetidae) to inflorescences of O. grandiflora. Pollen samples taken from the fur of captured individuals showed that M. altissimus carries pollen of O. grandiflora, indicating a potential pollinator role for the rodent. This is the first record of flower visitation by a rodent in the Neotropical Andes. Pollination interactions between non-flying mammals and Proteaceae have been reported in other southern hemisphere continents. This study underscores the need for more research on pollination interactions in the Neotropics, especially in critical Andean biodiversity hotspots.",2017

We describe a field study and pollinator exclusion experiments conducted on two soft-fruit crops in a system with both wild and managed pollinators. We test whether fruit quality and quantity is limited by pollination, and whether different pollinating insects respond differently to varying weather conditions. Both strawberries and raspberries produced fewer marketable fruits when insects were excluded, demonstrating dependence on insect pollinators. Raspberries had a short flowering season which coincided with peak abundance of bees, and attracted many bees per flower. In contrast, strawberries had a much longer flowering season and appeared to be much less attractive to pollinators, so that ensuring adequate pollination is likely to be more challenging. The proportion of high-quality strawberries was positively related to pollinator abundance, suggesting that yield was limited by inadequate pollination on some farms. The relative abundance of different pollinator taxa visiting strawberries changed markedly through the season, demonstrating seasonal complementarity. Insect visitors responded differently to changing weather conditions suggesting that diversity can reduce the risk of pollination service shortfalls. For example, flies visited the crop flowers in poor weather and at the end of the flowering season when other pollinators were scarce, and so may provide a unique functional contribution. Understanding how differences between pollinator groups can enhance pollination services to crops strengthens the case for multiple species management. We provide evidence for the link between increased diversity and function in real crop systems, highlighting the risks of replacing all pollinators with managed alternatives. ",2017

In this study, we appraised results from taxonomy, genetics, phylogenetics, phylogeography and pollination ecology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Galvezia. Location Peru, continental Ecuador and Galapagos. Methods We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions, ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of colonization to and across the Galapagos archipelago, based on Bayesian inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic diversity and differentiation within G.leucantha, we screened the genome of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the pollinators' assemblage of Galvezia. Results Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11 nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66-0.09Ma). In addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes) across the three continental species showed geographical differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of G.leucantha. AFLP genetic diversity is relatively high (H-T=0.109), but a low proportion of the total allelic variance is attributed to variation among subspecies/islands (H-b=0.035, hierarchical AMOVA: 3.77% of total variance). The endemic bee (Xylocopa darwinii) accounted for 87.30% of the floral visits to G.leucantha. Main conclusions We inferred a single origin for an insular lineage that colonized the Galapagos Islands from northern Peru in the Pleistocene. Recent colonization of the archipelago, Pleistocene land bridges between islands and active gene flow promoted by X.darwinii may account for the low-moderate genetic differentiation of G.leucantha subspecies. An unusual pollination shift from ornithophily (hummingbirds on the continent) to entomophily (Xylocopa in the Galapagos Islands) is supported.",2017
Pollinator population size and pollination ecosystem service responses to enhancing floral and nesting resources,bee foraging; bumble bees; crop pollination; ecosystem service mapping; landscape ecology; natural capital; pollination model; population dynamics; wildflower habitat,MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; COLONY GROWTH; LAND-USE; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; SOUTHERN SWEDEN; OILSEED RAPE; RED-CLOVER; FRUIT-SET; BUMBLEBEE; DENSITIES,"Modeling pollination ecosystem services requires a spatially explicit, process-based approach because they depend on both the behavioral responses of pollinators to the amount and spatial arrangement of habitat and on the within- and between-season dynamics of pollinator populations in response to land use. We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models. Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as large-scale management intervention and policy assessment.",2017

It leads to a higher level of fitness of both interacting partners. Birds play significant roles in plant reproduction and the fitness of ecosystem in tropical forest. This study was carried out with the objective to analyze legitimate floral visitors of Bombax ceiba Linn. in tropical forests of Indo-Burma region of India in relation to pollen production and mating system. The study was performed at two different locations, namely Bethlehem Vengthlang (23 degrees 430'N latitude and 92 degrees 430'E longitude) and Tanhril (43 degrees 37'N latitudes and 38 degrees 39'E longitudes). Both study sites are located 30 km apart from each other. Analysis revealed that the pollination in B. ceiba was mostly carried out by the birds, and the flowers were visited and foraged by thirteen (13) species of birds belonging to five families of the order of Passeriformes. One species of squirrel (Funambulus sp.) was also recorded visiting the flowers of B. ceiba. Study on mating-system evaluation revealed that the B ceiba is an outcrossing tree species, requiring the services of adequate pollinators for successful pollination and reproductive fitness. However, geitonogamy was partly functional. The index of self-incompatibility (ISI) value exposed that the species is mostly self-incompatible. All the species of birds were efficient pollinators for B. ceiba in the present study sites. The fruit and seed sets following natural pollination are fairly high compared with other bird-pollinated species. High pollen-production capacities per flower and per tree along with the high visitation of bird pollinators would have promoted the maximum reproductive success in B. ceiba. This also depicts that the species does not have the problem of pollen and resource limitations in Indo-Burma region of North-East India. B. ceiba tree is often used in urban forestry, and these results can be used for a comparative study of natural and human-altered ecosystems.",2017

In addition, floral scents are widely applied in perfumes, flavors, cosmetics and medicinal substances. Floral scents mediate ecological interactions and have a primary function of attracting visitors and pollinators. Due to the importance of floral scents in plant biology, basic research on flora scent through breeding technology or applications of biotechnology in is still needed. In plants, floral volatile organic compounds (VOC) are categorized into terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives. Several transcription factors are involved in secondary metabolite pathways, including floral scents. Transcriptional regulation of these biosynthesis pathways involves V- myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) protein transcription factors, which play a prominent role in flowers. However, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of floral scent biosynthesis. Thus far, the engineering of the metabolic pathways responsible for producing floral scents has mainly focused on the final steps of volatile compound generation. In this review, we summarize recent research on the importance and emission of floral scents and emphasize the role of the identified MYB transcription factors in regulating floral volatile metabolism.",2017

The study resulted in 588 interactions of A. dorsata with 40 plant species and 454 interactions of A. florea on 38 plant species. The most visited plants species by A. dorsata included Helianthus annuus, Citrus reticulata, Trifolium alexandrinum, Moringa oleifera and Calotropis procera, while the most visited plant species by A. florea included C. procera, Mangifera indica, T. alexandrinum, Coriandrum sativum and H. annuus. The peak abundance of bees and floral resources (i.e. number of plant species in flowering and abundance of floral units) was recorded during early March to late May followed by a gradual decline until December. Monthly abundance of both bee species was positively related to the floral resources, negatively related to relative humidity while it was not significantly related to temperature. The current study may serve as a baseline to track the degradation in ecosystem service of cross pollination and making new conservation strategies at local scale while future research should focus on tempo-spatial variations in foraging preferences, floral constancy and effect of foraging competition on crop pollination in different ecological regions of Pakistan.",2017

Since then, research on tropical mistletoes has burgeoned, as a growing number of researchers use these forest and woodland hemiparasites to address a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions. In this commentary, I highlight some recent findings, revisit and refine some emergent inferences, and suggest that tropical mistletoes offer many opportunities for further research, representing tractable models to address many unanswered questions in the life sciences. As well as reinforcing the role of mistletoes as facilitators for plant communities and keystone resources for animal assemblages, research on mistletoe pollination, seed dispersal, and host-range, challenge the established views about the ecological maintenance and evolutionary trajectory of specialization.",2017
Beetle pollination and flowering rhythm of Annona coriacea Mart. (Annonaceae) in Brazilian cerrado: Behavioral features of its principal pollinators,,FLORAL SCENT; COLEOPTERA SCARABAEIDAE; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; BREEDING SYSTEMS; CONSEQUENCES; COMMUNITY; LANDSCAPE; ARATICUM; DIVERSE; ARACEAE,"The conservation and sustainable management of Annona coriacea requires knowledge of its floral and reproductive biology, and of its main pollinators and their life cycles. In this work, we analyzed these aspects in detail. Floral biology was assessed by observing flowers from the beginning of anthesis to senescence. The visiting hours and behavior of floral visitors in the floral chamber were recorded, as were the sites of oviposition. Excavations were undertaken around specimens of A. coriacea to determine the location of immature pollinators. Anthesis was nocturnal, starting at sunset, and lasted for 52-56 h. The flowers were bisexual, protogynous and emitted a strong scent similar to the plant's own ripe fruit. There was pronounced synchrony among all floral events (the period and duration of stigmatic receptivity, release of odor, pollen release and drooping flowers) in different individuals, but no synchrony in the same individuals. All of the flowers monitored were visited by beetle species of the genera Cyclocephala and Arriguttia. Beetles arrived at the flowers with their bodies covered in pollen and these pollen grains were transferred to the stigmata while foraging on nutritious tissues at the base of the petals. With dehiscence of the stamens and retention within the floral chamber, the bodies of the floral visitors were again covered with pollen which they carried to newly opened flowers, thus promoting the cycle of pollination. After leaving the flowers, female beetles often excavated holes in the soil to lay eggs. Larvae were found between the leaf litter and the first layer of soil under specimens of A. coriacea. Cyclocephala beetles were the main pollinators of A. coriacea, but Arriguttia brevissima was also considered a pollinator and is the first species of this genus to be observed in Annonaceae flowers. Annona coriacea was found to be self-compatible with a low reproductive efficiency in the area studied. The results of this investigation provide ecological data that should contribute to the conservation and economic exploitation of A. coriacea.",2017
Does a Species' Extinction-Proneness Predict Its Contribution to Nestedness? A Test Using a Sunbird-Tree Visitation Network,,DISENTANGLING NESTEDNESS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; HUMMINGBIRDS; STABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; ARCHITECTURE; AFRICA,"Animal pollinators and the plants they pollinate depend on networks of mutualistic partnerships and more broadly on the stability of such networks. Based mainly on insect-plant visitation networks, theory predicts that species that are most prone to extinction contribute the most to nestedness, however empirical tests are rare. We used a sunbird-tree visitation network within which were both extinction prone vs non extinction prone sunbird species to test the idea. We predicted that the extinction prone species would contribute the most to nestedness. Using local abundance as a proxy for extinction risk we considered that locally rare sunbird species, by virtue of their small population size and associated demographic stochasticity to be more at risk of extinction than the common species. Our network was not strongly nested and all sunbird species made similar contributions to nestedness, so that in our empirical test, extinction proneness did not predict contribution to nestedness. The consequences of this finding remain unclear. It may be that network theory based on plant insect mutualisms is not widely applicable and does not work for tree-sunbird mutualistic networks. Alternatively it may be that our network was too small to provide results with any statistical power. Without doubt our study highlights the problems faced when testing network theory in the field; a plethora of ecological considerations can variously impact on results.",2017
Flower Visitors of Campanula: Are Oligoleges More Sensitive to Host-Specific Floral Scents Than Polyleges?,Electroantennography (EAG); Floral scents; Olfactory receptors; Oligolecty; Polylecty; Spiroacetals,SPECIALIZED BEES; EVOLUTION; POLLEN; CUES; ADVERTISEMENT; RECOGNITION; POLLINATOR; VOLATILES; ATTRACTS; ECOLOGY,"The pollen diet provided by adult bees to their offspring varies immensely. While some species collect pollen on several plants irrespective of their phylogenetic relatedness (polyleges), others collect only on plants within a genus or family (oligoleges). Floral scents play a central role in bee-plant interactions. To locate flowers, polyleges are assumed to rely on compounds commonly found as floral scent constituents, whereas oligoleges rely on unusual compounds to recognize host flowers unambiguously. Campanula flowers are visited by both polylectic and oligolectic species, and their scent bouquets consist of common and unusual (e.g., spiroacetals) volatiles. In a comparative approach, we performed electroantennographic analyses to investigate the antennal responses of three polyleges and three oligoleges to three common volatiles and four spiroacetals. We hypothesized that: 1) oligoleges and polyleges should respond similarly to common flower volatiles, and 2) Campanula oligoleges should be more sensitive to spiroacetals than are polyleges. In corroboration, we found that antennal sensitivity to common volatiles was similar among bees irrespective of pollen diet, whereas oligoleges of Campanula were more sensitive to spiroacetals than polyleges. Newly emerged bees of the Campanula oligolege Chelostoma rapunculi rely on spiroacetals for recognizing host-flowers, and our results suggest that this might also be true for other Campanula oligoleges, since Chelostoma campanularum and Hoplitis mitis also were able to perceive these specific volatiles at very low concentrations. Together, our results provide interesting insights into the significance of olfactory adaptations in oligolectic and polylectic bee species.",2017

Nonetheless, data showing effects of insect visit patterns and intensity of mutualistic and/or antagonistic plantinsect interactions on plant reproduction over structured ecological gradients remain scarce. We investigated how changes in flower-visitor abundance, identity and behaviour over a forest-open habitat gradient affect plant biotic interactions, and quantitative and qualitative fitness in the edge-specialist Dianthus balbisii. Composition and behaviour of the insects visiting flowers of D. balbisii strongly varied over the study gradient, influencing strength and patterns of plant biotic interactions (i.e. herbivory and pollination likelihood). Seed set comparison in free-and manually pollinated flowers suggested spatial variations in the extent of quantitative pollen limitation, which appeared more pronounced at the gradient extremes. Such variations were congruent to patterns of flower visit and plant biotic interactions. The analyses on seed and seedling viability evidenced that spatial variation in amount and type of pollinators, and frequency of herbivory affected qualitative fitness of D. balbisii by influencing selfing and outcrossing rates. Our work emphasizes the role of plant biotic interactions as a fine-scale mediator of plant fitness in ecotones, highlighting that optimal plant reproduction can take place into a restricted interval of the ecological gradients occurring at forest edges. Reducing the habitat complexity typical of such transition contexts can threat edge-adapted plants.",2017

Community-level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape-scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build-up of visitor populations. To study species-level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta-analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density. The strength of impact was modulated across native species by their floral traits and reproductive ecology.",2017

This suggests that floral traits are not always predictive of the animal visitors that pollinate cactus flowers. Here, we studied the pollination of Echinopsis leucantha (Gillies ex Salm-Dyck) Walp., an endemic cactus of Argentina, whose floral traits would suggest that it is pollinated by moths. The floral lifespan and flower availability throughout the reproductive period were evaluated. Field experiments were carried out to study the reproductive system and the identity and effectiveness of floral visitors. Echinopsis leucantha flowers had a nocturnal anthesis time that extended into the following morning. The species was self-incompatible. Floral visitors included moths, bees, and passerine birds. However, diurnal visitors were more effective as pollinators than nocturnal ones. The flowers of E. leucantha were phenotypically specialized (sphingophily); however, the pollination system was functionally and ecologically generalized. The results confirm that generalized pollination systems are widespread among species of the Echinopsis genus with nocturnal flowers, for which diurnal pollinators seem to have a key role in fruit and seed production. Our study constitutes the first record of passerine bird pollination in the Cactaceae for mainland South America.",2017

We studied how floral traits affect pollinator visitation and efficiency, and how they affect male and female function and female fitness within and across three Asclepias species that differ in floral morphology. METHODS: Using separate multiple regressions, we regressed pollen removal, deposition, and fruit number onto six floral traits. We also used path analyses integrating these variables with pollinator visitation data for two of the species to further explore floral function and its effects on fruit production. KEY RESULTS: Most traits affected male pollination success only, and these effects often differed between species. The exception was increased slit length, which increased pollinia insertion in two of the species. There were no interspecific differences in the effects of the traits on female pollination success. All traits except horn reach affected pollination efficiency in at least one species, and horn reach and two hood dimensions were the only traits to affect pollinator attraction, but in just one species. CONCLUSIONS: Traits tended to function in only one sex, and more traits affected function through pollinator efficiency than through attraction. There was no significant link between female pollination success and female fitness in any of the three species; this pattern is consistent with fruit production not being limited by pollen deposition.",2017

Influence of the honeybee and trait similarity on the effect of a non-native plant on pollination and network rewiring,Apis mellifera; flower morphology; Hedysarum coronarium; plant invasion; plant-pollinator communities; pollinator functional group,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; INVASIVE PLANTS; ALIEN PLANT; INTRODUCED HONEYBEES; FORAGING RANGES; APIS-MELLIFERA; FLORAL TRAITS; MATING SYSTEM; FRUIT-SET,"1. Introduced entomophilous non-native plants usually become well integrated into the diet of generalist pollinators. This integration can affect the entire recipient plant-pollinator network. Effects vary from facilitative to competitive, and understanding the factors that govern such variability is one of the fundamental goals in invasion ecology. Species traits determine the linking patterns between plant and pollinator species. Therefore, trait similarity among plants or among pollinators might modulate how they affect each other. 2. We conducted a flower removal experiment to investigate the effects of the non-native entomophilous legume Hedysarum coronarium on the pollination patterns of a Mediterranean shrubland plant-pollinator network. Specifically, we explored whether effects were influenced by similarity with the resident plant species in flower morphology (papilionate vs. non-papilionate), and whether effects on the pollinator community were influenced by similarity in functional group with its main visitor species (bees vs. non-bees). In addition, we explored whether Hedysarum had an effect on the identity of interactions. For this purpose, we calculated the interaction rewiring, that is the number of plant-pollinator interactions that were gained or lost after invasion. 3. Hedysarum was well integrated into the diet of 15 generalist pollinators having the honeybee as its main visitor species. Such integration did not affect visitation rates, normalized degree (i. e. proportion of pollinators they are visited by) nor niche overlap (i. e. proportion of plant species they share pollinators with) of plants, irrespective of their flower morphology. Only the proportion of honeybee visits to resident plants decreased with invasion. On the other hand, Hedysarum reduced visitation rates and niche overlap of pollinators, mainly those of bee species. Finally, we observed that changes in the foraging behaviour of the honeybee were positively associated with the interaction rewiring involving the rest (92 taxa) of pollinators. 4. In conclusion, pollinators show a plastic use of floral resources, responding to the presence of non-native plants. When the non-native attracts highly competitive pollinators such as the honeybee, plasticity is especially significant in pollinators that are functionally close to that competitive pollinator. The result is an interaction rewiring, probably due to pollinators avoiding competition with the honeybee. Though this plasticity might not quantitatively affect the pollination of plants, consequences on their reproduction and the functioning of the network can derive from the interaction rewiring.",2017
Reproductive biology of the critically endangered endemic plant Erodium somanum in Turkey,Erodium somanum; reproductive biology; endangered endemic species; dioecious plant; conservation needs,GERANIACEAE; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; ECOLOGY,"The reproductive characteristics of Erodium somanum (Geraniaceae), a critically endangered endemic species, were investigated in order to evaluate the main factors that affect its reproductive success and to evaluate their importance on its conservation. The estimated pollen/ovule ratio was calculated as 1187. Pollen viability and stigma receptivity experiments showed that stigma receptivity and pollen viability were high and synchronous throughout the anthesis. E. somanum is a strictly dioecious species and pollinated by insects. Flower visitors in the studied populations were mostly beetles and ants. The average percentage of fruit formation for each plant was determined as 46%. Capacity of seed production for each plant was 36%. Seed viability and germination success were determined as 81% and 80%, respectively. When combined, the capacity of viable and germinative seed production for each plant was determined as 29%. The factor that most affects the reproductive success is thought to be the low density of pollinators. With the direct and indirect effects, population viability seems considerable.",2017
BIOLOGY OF POLLINATION OF Citrus sinensis VARIETY 'PERA RIO',Apoidea; citricultura; pollination; bee population; orange,,"Aspects related to the floral biology of Citrus sinensis 'Pera Rio' variety were studied in the present work aiming to obtain information about the pollination ecology in the local agriculture. Studies of flowering, anthesis, pollen / ovule ratio, stigmatic receptivity, pollen viability, nectar characterization and floral visitors were carried out. From the data studied, the following information was obtained: C. sinensis variety 'Pera Rio' flourishes in two annual periods (dry and rainy), the anthesis occurs from 9: 00 AM with duration of 24 hours, during which period stigma receptivity, pollen viability and nectar secretion are highly significant, demonstrating that the species also possesses characteristics of allogenic plants. Apis mellifera was a floral visitor, with a greater number of individuals with a Relative Frequency (RF) of 51.1%. Melipona scutellaris obtained second place in visits with RR = 23.6%; Followed by Trigona spinipes with FR = 17.7%. The two seasons (dry and rainy) presented high similarity (Morisita index = 0.64). C. sinensis has floral biology favorable to cross pollination and bees A. mellifera and M. scutellaris are potential pollinators of this fruit in the conditions in the region of the Reconcavo Baiano. The reproductive system of C. sinensis is mixed, being favorable to entomophilic pollination.",2017

But conservation of those iconic plants is important since they are key stone species to understand evolution and diversification in those ecosystems. We investigated the distribution, host plants and floral biology of a root holoparasite Langsdorffia hypogaea Mart. (Balanophoraceae) in the Brazilian Savanna of southern Brazil. Langsdorffia hypogaea showed an aggregated distribution in patches, and similar sex ratio and abundance between populations. The nectar was secreted by extra-floral structures at the basal bracts of females and among freshly open flowers on male inflorescences. Nectar was relatively dilute (11-18%), and concentration and volume did not differ between male and female flowers. We found five plant species of different families as hosts, confirming that L. hypogaea is a generalist and suggesting interactions with the local plant community based on abundance and/or host quality. Besides a non quantified number of insect species, we recorded for the first time a bird species visiting and possibly pollinating the inflorescences. Despite the limited observations, the information provided here opens interesting lines of investigation on the reproductive biology of this species.  ",2017
Species-environment interactions changed by introduced herbivores in an oceanic high-mountain ecosystem,Autofertility; Canary Islands; elevational gradient; herbivory; pollen limitation; rabbits; Viola cheiranthifolia,CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; POLLEN LIMITATION; GLOBAL CHANGE; VISITATION RATES; CANARY-ISLANDS; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SEED DISPERSAL; PLANT FITNESS,"Summit areas of oceanic islands constitute some of the most isolated ecosystems on earth, highly vulnerable to climate change and introduced species. Within the unique high-elevation communities of Tenerife (Canary Islands), reproductive success and thus the long-term survival of the speciesmay depend on environmental suitability as well as threat by introduced herbivores. By experimentally modifying the endemic and vulnerable species Viola cheiranthifolia along its entire altitudinal occurrence range, we studied plant performance, autofertility, pollen limitation and visitation rate and the interactive effect of grazing by non-native rabbits on them. We assessed the grazing effects by recording (i) the proportion of consumed plants and flowers along the gradient, (ii) comparing fitness traits of herbivore-excluded plants along the gradient, and (iii) comparing fitness traits, autofertility and pollen limitation between plants excluded from herbivores with unexcluded plants at the same locality. Our results showed that V. cheiranthifolia performance is mainly affected by inter-annual and microhabitat variability along the gradient, especially in the lowest edge. Despite the increasingly adverse environmental conditions, the plant showed no pollen limitation with elevation, which is attributed to the increase in autofertility levels (>= 50% of reproductive output) and decrease in competition for pollinators at higher elevations. Plant fitness is, however, extremely reduced owing to the presence of non-native rabbits in the area (consuming more than 75% of the individuals in some localities), which in turn change plant trait-environment interactions along the gradient. Taken together, these findings indicate that the elevational variation found on plant performance results from the combined action of non-native rabbits with the microhabitat variability, exerting intricate ecological influences that threaten the survival of this violet species.",2017
Endangered by laws: potential consequences of regulations against thistles on bumblebee conservation,Bombus; Cardueae; Carduus; Cirsium; floral resources; pollinator conservation; weed control legislation,WEED MANAGEMENT; FIELD MARGINS; BEES; POPULATIONS; POLLINATION; LANDSCAPE; HABITAT; SYSTEMS; RARITY; BOMBUS,"Many bumblebee (Bombus) species are undergoing a strong decline in Europe due to, amongst other things, a decrease of food resources. While leguminous plants (Fabaceae) are considered to be one of the main pollen sources of bumblebees, thistles (Asteraceae tribe Cardueae) have been suggested to be important for male diet. Yet, several European countries apply strict regulations against thistles since they are considered to be one of the principal weeds in agricultural landscapes. Such regulations could impact bumblebee conservation through disruption of male diet and ecology. Here, we assess the male-depending importance of thistles for bumblebee species based on field observations across countries where a legal regulation against thistles is in effect. We ultimately aim to evaluate the potential consequences of these regulations on bumblebee conservation. Our results confirm that most floral visit observations of males occur on thistles (mainly Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.) and some species are almost exclusively observed on them. Thistle removal is thus most likely a threat for bumblebees. Therefore, we advocate repealing the thistle removal acts to make way for alternative thistle regulations which reconcile biodiversity conservation and agricultural requirements.",2017
Macronutrient ratios in pollen shape bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) foraging strategies and floral preferences,foraging behavior; nutritional ecology; pollen; pollinator; preferences,ESSENTIAL AMINO-ACIDS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; SOLITARY BEES; PROTEIN-LEVELS; TERRESTRIS; HYMENOPTERA; BEHAVIOR; APIDAE; POLLINATORS,"To fuel their activities and rear their offspring, foraging bees must obtain a sufficient quality and quantity of nutritional resources from a diverse plant community. Pollen is the primary source of proteins and lipids for bees, and the concentrations of these nutrients in pollen can vary widely among host-plant species. Therefore we hypothesized that foraging decisions of bumble bees are driven by both the protein and lipid content of pollen. By successively reducing environmental and floral cues, we analyzed pollen-foraging preferences of Bombus impatiens in (i) host-plant species, (ii) pollen isolated from these host-plant species, and (iii) nutritionally modified single-source pollen diets encompassing a range of protein and lipid concentrations. In our semifield experiments, B. impatiens foragers exponentially increased their foraging rates of pollen from plant species with high protein: lipid (P:L) ratios; the most preferred plant species had the highest ratio (similar to 4.6:1). These preferences were confirmed in cage studies where, in pairwise comparisons in the absence of other floral cues, B. impatiens workers still preferred pollen with higher P: L ratios. Finally, when presented with nutritionally modified pollen, workers were most attracted to pollen with P: L ratios of 5: 1 and 10: 1, but increasing the protein or lipid concentration (while leaving ratios intact) reduced attraction. Thus, macronutritional ratios appear to be a primary factor driving bee pollen-foraging behavior and may explain observed patterns of host-plant visitation across the landscape. The nutritional quality of pollen resources should be taken into consideration when designing conservation habitats supporting bee populations.",2016

As expected, given an increase in average air temperature with climate warming and a declining temperature with increasing elevation, there have been significant shifts toward higher elevation for queens or workers or both, for most bumble bee species, for bumble bee queens when species are combined, and for two focal plant species, with no significant downward shifts. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to observe significant altitudinal changes for some bumble bee species and most plant species, and observed changes in elevation were often less than the upward shift of 317m required to maintain average temperature. As expected, community flowering phenology shifted toward earlier in the season throughout our study area, but bumble bee phenology generally did not change, resulting in decreased synchrony between bees and plants. However, we were unable to confirm the narrower expectation that phenologies of bumble bee workers and community flowering coincided in 1974 but not in 2007. As expected, because of reduced synchrony between bumble bees and community flowering, bumble bee abundance was reduced in 2007 compared with 1974. Hence, climate change in our study area has apparently resulted primarily in reduced abundance and upward shift in distribution for bumble bees and shift toward earlier seasonality for plant flowering. Quantitative disagreements between climate change expectations and our observations warrant further investigation.",2016

Investigating the mechanisms by which species interactions may shift under altered environmental conditions will help form a more predictive understanding of such shifts. In particular, components of climate change have the potential to strongly influence floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, in turn, plant-pollinator interactions. In this study, we experimentally manipulated drought and herbivory for four forb species to determine effects of these treatments and their interactions on (1) visual plant traits traditionally associated with pollinator attraction, (2) floral VOCs, and (3) the visitation rates and community composition of pollinators. For all forbs tested, experimental drought universally reduced flower size and floral display, but there were species-specific effects of drought on volatile emissions per flower, the composition of compounds produced, and subsequent pollinator visitation rates. Moreover, the community of pollinating visitors was influenced by drought across forb species (i.e. some pollinator species were deterred by drought while others were attracted). Together, these results indicate that VOCs may provide more nuanced information to potential floral visitors and may be relatively more important than visual traits for pollinator attraction, particularly under shifting environmental conditions.",2016
Weed-insect pollinator networks as bio-indicators of ecological sustainability in agriculture.

Weeds are serious competitors for crop production and are thus controlled. Nonetheless, weeds enhance floral diversity in agricultural landscapes. Weeds provide food for insects in exchange for pollination. The stability of mutualistic interactions in pollination networks depends on conservation of insect pollinator and weed communities. Some agricultural practices can destabilize interactions and thus modify the stability of pollination networks. Therefore, more knowledge on weed-insect networks is needed. Here, we review the interactions involved in insect visits to weed flowers in temperate arable lands. Our main findings are that (1) weed pollination by insects has a key role in maintaining weed communities in arable lands; (2) weed-insect pollinator interactions are modulated by the flowers' features and their quality which are attracting insects; (3) most weeds are associated with generalist insect pollinators; and (4) even if weed-pollinator networks are largely mutualistic, some antagonist networks can be observed when deception occurs. We propose three weed-insect pollinator networks as potential bio-indicators to evaluate the ecological sustainability of arable land management strategies in temperate areas: (1) Geometridae and Bombyliidae species visiting Caryophyllaceae, (2) Papilionidae foraging on Apiaceae, and (3) Syrphidae visiting Asteraceae.",2016

A major challenge in evolutionary ecology is to understand how co-evolutionary processes shape patterns of interactions between species at community level. Pollination of flowers with long corolla tubes by long-tongued hawkmoths has been invoked as a showcase model of co-evolution. Recently, optimal foraging models have predicted that there might be a close association between mouthparts' length and the corolla depth of the visited flowers, thus favouring trait convergence and specialization at community level. 2. Here, we assessed whether hawkmoths more frequently pollinate plants with floral tube lengths similar to their proboscis lengths (morphological match hypothesis) against abundance-based processes (neutral hypothesis) and ecological trait mismatches constraints (forbidden links hypothesis), and how these processes structure hawkmoth-plant mutualistic networks from five communities in four biogeographical regions of South America. 3. We found convergence in morphological traits across the five communities and that the distribution of morphological differences between hawkmoths and plants is consistent with expectations under the morphological match hypothesis in three of the five communities. In the two remaining communities, which are ecotones between two distinct biogeographical areas, interactions are better predicted by the neutral hypothesis. 4. Our findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse co-evolution drives the evolution of extremely long proboscises and flower tubes, and highlight the importance of morphological traits, beyond the forbidden links hypothesis, in structuring interactions between mutualistic partners, revealing that the role of niche-based processes can be much more complex than previously known.",2016

Evaluation of patterns and correlates of among-and within-species variation in heterospecific pollen (HP) receipt is key to understanding its importance for floral evolution and species coexistence; however, the rarity of deeply sampled multispecies comparisons has precluded such an evaluation. METHODS: We evaluated patterns of among-and within-species variation in HP load size and diversity in 19 species across three distinct plant communities. We assessed the importance of phenotypic specialization (floral phenotype), ecological specialization (contemporary visitor assemblage), and conspecific flower density as determinants of among-species variation. We present hypotheses for different accrual patterns of HP within species based on the evenness and quality of floral visitors and evaluated these by characterizing the relationship between conspecific pollen (CP) and HP receipt. KEY RESULTS: We found that within-species variation in HP receipt was greater than among-species and among-communities variation. Among species, ecological generalization emerged as the strongest driver of variation in HP receipt irrespective of phenotypic specialization. Within-species variation in HP load size and diversity was predicted most often from two CP-HP relationships (linear or exponentially decreasing), suggesting that two distinct types of plant-pollinator interactions prevail. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give important insights into the potential drivers of among-and within-species variation in HP receipt. They also highlight the value of explorations of patterns at the intraspecific level, which can ultimately shed light on plant-pollinator-mediated selection in diverse plant communities.",2016
Experimental manipulation of floral scent bouquets restructures flower-visitor interactions in the field,community structure; floral extracts; floral filters; flower-visitor partitioning; olfactometer trials,HONEYBEE APIS-MELLIFERA; POLLINATOR ATTRACTION; TRAITS; ODOR; EVOLUTION; RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; COLOR,"A common structural feature of natural communities is the non-random distribution of pairwise interactions between organisms of different trophic levels. For plant-animal interactions, it is predicted that both stochastic processes and functional plant traits that facilitate or prevent interactions are responsible for these patterns. However, unbiased manipulative field experiments that rigorously test the effects of individual traits on community structure are lacking. We address this gap by manipulating floral scent bouquets in the field. Manipulation of floral scent bouquets led to quantitative as well as qualitative restructuring of flower-visitor networks, making them more generalized. Olfactometer trials confirmed both positive and negative responses to scent bouquets. Our results clearly show that the distribution of insect visitors to the two abundant study plant species reflects the insects' species-specific preferences for floral scents, rather than for visual or morphological floral traits. Thus, floral scents may be of major importance in partitioning flower-visitor interactions. Integrating experimental manipulations of plant traits with field observations of interaction patterns thus represents a promising approach for revealing the processes that structure species assemblages in natural communities.",2016
Flower colour and visitation rates of Costus arabicus support the 'bee avoidance' hypothesis for red-reflecting hummingbird-pollinated flowers,floral traits; plant-pollinator interactions; pollination ecology; pollinator vision; sensory exclusion,BUMBLEBEES BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; SPECTRAL SENSITIVITIES; FORAGING SPEED; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; DISCRIMINATION; PREFERENCE; HONEYBEES; PENSTEMON; SIGNALS,"1. Floral colour mediates plant-pollinator interactions by often signalling floral resources. In this sense, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are frequently red-coloured, and there are two tentative hypotheses to explain this pattern: 1. hummingbirds are attracted to red due its easier detection and 2. bees are sensorially excluded from red flowers. The second hypothesis is based on bees' red colour blindness, which lead them to be less frequent and less important than hummingbirds as pollinators of red-reflecting flowers. 2. Here, we untangled the role of different flower traits mediating plant-pollinator interactions and empirically tested the above hypotheses. We chose Costus arabicus due to its synchronopatric white- and pink-flowered individuals and its bee and hummingbird pollination system. Although pink flowers are not totally achromatic as pure red ones, they show an achromaticity degree that could drive bee exclusion. Specifically, we tested whether differences on red reflectance work attracting hummingbirds or excluding bees and the consequent implications for the plant's reproduction. 3. Flower colour morphs of C. arabicus do differ neither in morphology nor in nectar sugar content. Moreover, white and pink flowers can be discriminated by the bees' and hummingbirds' colour vision system. Both groups are able to discriminate the red colour variation morph on the flower petals, the white flowers being more easily detected by bees and the pink flowers by hummingbirds. Bees preferentially visited the white flowers, whereas hummingbirds visited both colours at the same rate - both patterns corroborating the second hypothesis. 4. Pollen loads deposited on stigmas did not differ between flower colour morphs, indicating that bees and hummingbirds play a similar role in the overall pollen deposition. However, bees are more likely to self-pollinate than hummingbirds. Self-pollination limits C. arabicus reproduction, and red-reflecting flowers may be better pollinated by discouraging bee visitation. Therefore, the intraspecific colour variation is driving flowers to show colour-related different levels of generalization. 5. Our results support the 'bee avoidance' rather than the 'hummingbird preference' hypothesis. Sensory exclusion of bees seems to be the pressure for red-reflecting flowers evolution, driving specialization in hummingbird-pollinated flowers due to the costs of bee pollination on plant reproduction.",2016

Plants evolved strategies to attract pollinators that are essential for reproduction. However, plant defence against herbivores may trade off with pollinator attraction. 2. Here, we investigated the role of inducible plant secondary metabolites in such a trade-off. Our objective was to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of induced plant responses to pollination and herbivory. We assessed how responses of plants to pollination and insect herbivory affect the behaviour of flower visitors. Subsequently, we investigated how the production of volatile and non-volatile compounds changes after pollination and herbivory. 3. Both herbivores and pollinators induced important phenotypic changes in flowers. Brassica nigra plants respond to pollination and herbivory with changes in the profile of volatiles and non-volatiles of their flowers. Our results show that butterflies use different cues when searching for an oviposition site or a nectar source. Pollination status influenced the behaviour of butterflies, but not that of syrphid flies. 4. We discuss the results in the context of the trade-off between defence and reproduction in plants and suggest that systemic responses to herbivores can interfere with local responses to pollination. Therefore, these responses must be addressed in an integrated way because, in nature, plants are simultaneously exposed to herbivores and pollinators.",2016
Bees use the taste of pollen to determine which flowers to visit,Bombus; bumblebee; pollen; taste; pollination,BUMBLE BEES; PREFERENCES; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; NECTAR,"Pollen plays a dual role as both a gametophyte and a nutritional reward for pollinators. Although pollen chemistry varies across plant species, its functional significance in pollination has remained obscure, in part because little is known about how floral visitors assess it. Bees rely on pollen for protein, but whether foragers evaluate its chemistry is unclear, as it is primarily consumed by larvae. We asked whether the chemical composition of pollen influences bumblebees' foraging behaviour. Using putatively sweet and bitter pollen blends, we found that chemical composition influenced two aspects of bee behaviour relevant to plant fitness: the amount of pollen collected and the likelihood of subsequently visiting a visually similar flower. These findings offer a new perspective on the nutritional ecology of plant-pollinator interactions, as they show that pollen's taste may mediate its collection and transfer.",2016

Altering flowering phenology often affects plant reproduction, but the mechanisms behind these changes are not well-understood. To investigate why altering flowering phenology affects plant reproduction, we manipulated flowering phenology of the spring herb Claytonia lanceolata (Portulacaceae) using two methods: in 2011-2013 by altering snow pack (snow-removal vs. control treatments), and in 2013 by inducing flowering in a greenhouse before placing plants in experimental outdoor arrays (early, control, and late treatments). We measured flowering phenology, pollinator visitation, plant reproduction (fruit and seed set), and pollen limitation. Flowering occurred approx. 10days earlier in snow-removal than control plots during all years of snow manipulation. Pollinator visitation patterns and strength of pollen limitation varied with snow treatments, and among years. Plants in the snow removal treatment were more likely to experience frost damage, and frost-damaged plants suffered low reproduction despite lack of pollen limitation. Plants in the snow removal treatment that escaped frost damage had higher pollinator visitation rates and reproduction than controls. The results of the array experiment supported the results of the snow manipulations. Plants in the early and late treatments suffered very low reproduction due either to severe frost damage (early treatment) or low pollinator visitation (late treatment) relative to control plants. Thus, plants face tradeoffs with advanced flowering time. While early-flowering plants can reap the benefits of enhanced pollination services, they do so at the cost of increased susceptibility to frost damage that can overwhelm any benefit of flowering early. In contrast, delayed flowering results in dramatic reductions in plant reproduction through reduced pollination. Our results suggest that climate change may constrain the success of early-flowering plants not through plant-pollinator mismatch but through the direct impacts of extreme environmental conditions.",2016
"Time-invariant differences between plant individuals in interactions with arthropods correlate with intraspecific variation in plant phenology, morphology and floral scent",community ecology; functional traits; interaction pattern; interindividual variation; network; Sinapis arvensis,POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; POLLEN LIMITATION; GENERALIST PLANT; WILD RADISH; FLOWER SIZE; TRAITS; FITNESS,"The basic units of ecological and evolutionary processes are individuals. Network studies aiming to infer mechanisms from complex systems, however, usually focus on interactions between species, not individuals. Accordingly, the structure and underlying mechanisms of individual-based interaction networks remain largely unknown. In a common garden, we recorded all interactions on flowers and leaves of 97 Sinapis arvensis individuals from seedling stage to fruit set and related interindividual differences in interactions to the plant individuals' phenotypes. The plant individuals significantly differed in their quantitative and qualitative interactions with arthropods on flowers and leaves. These differences remained stable over the entire season and thus were time-invariant. Variation in interacting arthropod communities could be explained by a pronounced intraspecific variability in flowering phenology, morphology and flower scent, and translated into variation in reproductive success. Interestingly, plant individuals with a similar composition of flower visitors were also visited by a similar assemblage of interaction partners at leaves. Our results show that the nonuniformity of plant species has pronounced effects in community ecology, potentially with implications for the persistence of communities and populations, and their ability to withstand environmental fluctuations.",2016

Such information is essential if appropriate orchard management practices are to be targeted and proportional to the potential benefits pollinator species may provide. Here we use a novel combination of pollinator effectiveness assays (floral visit effectiveness), orchard field surveys (flower visitation rate) and pollinator dependence manipulations (pollinator exclusion experiments) to quantify the supply of pollination services provided by four different pollinator guilds to the production of four commercial varieties of apple. We show that not all pollinators are equally effective at pollinating apples, with hoverflies being less effective than solitary bees and bumblebees, and the relative abundance of different pollinator guilds visiting apple flowers of different varieties varies significantly. Based on this, the taxa specific economic benefits to UK apple production have been established. The contribution of insect pollinators to the economic output in all varieties was estimated to be 92.1M pound across the UK, with contributions varying widely across taxa: solitary bees (51.4M) pound, honeybees (21.4M) pound, bumblebees (18.6M) pound and hoverflies (0.7M) pound. This research highlights the differences in the economic benefits of four insect pollinator guilds to four major apple varieties in the UK. This information is essential to underpin appropriate investment in pollination services management and provides a model that can be used in other entomolophilous crops to improve our understanding of crop pollination ecology.",2016

Here, using breeding system experiments and observations of floral visitors, we investigate whether a lack of pollinators or an inability to autonomously self-fertilise limits naturalisation in five Australian Banksia species and the co-familial Hakea salicifolia in South Africa. Banksia species were heavily utilised by native insects and nectar-feeding birds. Although Banksia produced fruit when pollinators were excluded, pollinators significantly increased seed set in four of the five species. H. salicifolia flowers were visited by 11 insect species; honeybees (Apis mellifera) were the main visitors. Flowers in naturalised H. salicifolia populations received almost four times the number of visits as flowers in non-naturalised populations; the latter showed both pollen limitation (PLI 0.40) and partial self-incompatibility. This should not prevent invasion, since H. salicifolia produces fruits via autonomous selfing in the absence of pollinators. The results suggest a limited role of breeding systems in mediating naturalisation of introduced Proteaceae species. Other factors, such as features of the recipient environments, appear to be more important. Spatial variation in rates of reproduction might, however, explain variation in the extent and rate of naturalisation of different populations.",2016

However, little is known about how interactions between these factors contribute to yield. Here, we used oilseed rape Brassica napus to test their effects on crop yield. We exposed potted plants to all combinations of high and low levels of soil organic matter (SOM) and fertilizer supply, and placed all treatments at a variety of field sites representing a gradient in pollinator visitation rate and pest exposure. We determined the relative contribution of pollinators and pests, SOM and fertilizer supply to yield. We also tested whether SOM can moderate effects of fertilizer on yield and whether soil conditions influence the relationship between above-ground conditions and yield. Increases in pollinator visitation rate and decreases in pest pressure enhanced yield more than increase in fertilizer supply. Although higher SOM content resulted in plants with more biomass and flowers, under our experimental conditions SOM neither enhanced yield, nor influenced effects of fertilizer, pollinators or pests on yield. The relationships between yield, pollinator visitation rate and pest pressure did not depend on the level of fertilization, suggesting that the effects of fertilizer application and above-ground (dis)services on yield were additive. In contrast, pollinator visitation rate was more strongly related to yield at low pest pressure than at high pest pressure indicating trade-offs between above-ground services and disservices.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that it is possible to increase oilseed rape yield by enhancing pollination, irrespective of supplying mineral fertilizer. Moreover, the fact that below-ground conditions did not alter the effect of above-ground conditions suggests that farmers may obtain even higher yields by maximizing both above-ground ecosystem services and external inputs. Further studies are needed to understand at which point the positive relationships between pollinator visitation and yield, as well as between fertilizer and yield, will level off. Considering above-ground and below-ground services and inputs in agro-ecosystems in conjunction is crucial in order to optimize external inputs for crop yield from an economic and ecological perspective.",2016
Invasion status and phylogenetic relatedness predict cost of heterospecific pollen receipt: implications for native biodiversity decline,coflowering; invasion ecology; invasive species; plant-pollinator interactions; pollen transfer; pollinator sharing,PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS; ALIEN PLANTS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; EXOTIC INVASION; FLORAL TRAITS; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITIES; IMPACT; SUCCESS,"Understanding the mechanisms by which invasive species affect native plants is a central challenge. Invasive plants have been shown to reduce pollinator visitation to natives and increase pollen quantity limitation. However, visitation and conspecific pollen delivery are the only two components of the pollination process; post-pollination interactions on the stigma (heterospecific pollen [HP] receipt) could intensify pre-pollination responses to invasion. Here, we used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that invasive plants are more detrimental as HP donors than natives ones and that HP donors that are closely related to the recipients have stronger effects on fruit and seed production compared to distantly related ones. Invasive HP donors reduced fruit and seed production of recipients to a greater degree than native ones, and this was more intense for HP donors closely related to natives. Related donors were more detrimental overall.Synthesis. These results suggest that the total effect of invasive plants on native plant reproductive success could be greater than what is inferred from visitation and conspecific pollen transfer alone. Furthermore, these results indicate that invasive species can reduce reproductive success of native species even if pollinator visitation rates remain unaltered. Thus, we highlight the need to evaluate pre- and post-pollination processes in order to fully understand the potential effects of invasive species on the reproductive success and maintenance of native plant populations.",2016
Convergence beyond flower morphology? Reproductive biology of hummingbird-pollinated plants in the Brazilian Cerrado,Ananas; Bionia; Bromeliaceae; Camptosema; Esterhazya; Fabaceae; Ornithophily; Orobanchaceae,NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; BREEDING SYSTEM; FLORAL RESOURCE; FOREST; ECOLOGY; BROMELIACEAE; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR,"Convergent reproductive traits in non-related plants may be the result of similar environmental conditions and/or specialised interactions with pollinators. Here, we documented the pollination and reproductive biology of Bionia coriacea (Fabaceae), Esterhazya splendida (Orobanchaceae) and Ananas ananassoides (Bromeliaceae) as case studies in the context of hummingbird pollination in Cerrado, the Neotropical savanna of Central South America. We combined our results with a survey of hummingbird pollination studies in the region to investigate the recently suggested association of hummingbird pollination and self-compatibility. Plant species studied here differed in their specialisation for ornithophily, from more generalist A. ananassoides to somewhat specialist B. coriacea and E. splendida. This continuum of specialisation in floral traits also translated into floral visitor composition. Amazilia fimbriata was the most frequent pollinator for all species, and the differences in floral display and nectar energy availability among plant species affect hummingbirds' behaviour. Most of the hummingbird-pollinated Cerrado plants (60.0%, n = 20), including those studied here, were self-incompatible, in contrast to other biomes in the Neotropics. Association to more generalist, often territorial, hummingbirds, and resulting reduced pollen flow in open savanna areas may explain predominance of self-incompatibility. But it is possible that mating system is more associated with the predominance of woody hummingbird plants in the Cerrado plant assemblage than to the pollination system itself.",2016
Spatial heterogeneity of a parasitic plant drives the seed-dispersal pattern of a zoochorous plant community in a generalist dispersal system,frugivory; mistletoe; plant-animal interactions; plant-plant interactions; spatial-temporal variability; Viscum album,TROPICAL MISTLETOE; FRUITING TREES; HOST; FRUGIVORES; BEHAVIOR; SIZE; CONSEQUENCES; AGGREGATION; RECRUITMENT; POLLINATION,"1. Biota plays a central role as sources of spatial heterogeneity, having great potential to define ecological processes and patterns in the landscape. Mistletoes are fleshy-fruited parasitic plants that dwell in forest canopies showing a strong aggregated spatial distribution. Parasitized trees potentially concentrate frugivore activity on their canopy, where birds find food, places to perch and protection against predators. Thus, seed-deposition patterns generated from the canopy are expected to reflect the heterogeneity associated with the parasite. This becomes especially important in generalist dispersal systems; however, so far, we do not know the implications of mistletoe spatial heterogeneity on the seed-dispersal pattern of other plants with which they simultaneously fruit. 2. In a Mediterranean pineland, we analyse the impact of Viscum album subsp. austriacum on the seed-deposition pattern of a zoochorous plant community, taking into consideration the spatial and temporal variability of environmental factors influencing the frugivore's habitat use, such as fruit availability and forest tree density. For four consecutive years, we studied 55 pairs of trees parasitized and unparasitized by mistletoe, analysing zoochorous fruit availability, frugivore visits and the zoochorous seed rain in selected trees. 3. As expected, frugivorous birds responded to mistletoe heterogeneity by visiting parasitized trees preferentially to unparasitized ones, generating a differential deposition of mistletoe seeds on tree branches while dispersing seeds of co-fruiting species under the host canopy. Availability of understory fruits remained similar in patches of parasitized and unparasitized trees, but showed strong temporal fluctuations reflected in the seed rain. On the other hand, mistletoe proved more copious in patches of parasitized trees and their fruit crops varied little between years, making mistletoes reliable food resources likely to lead to consistency in fruit-deposition patterns. 4. In conclusion, mistletoes, by patchily growing on the canopy layer and concentrating zoochorous seeds underneath, can shape the spatial seed-deposition pattern of fleshy-fruited plants in the forest. Moreover, as seeds constantly reach the same deposition sites over long periods, the soil beneath the host canopy could become hotspots for community regeneration. In degraded areas, such mistletoe effects might be critical, possibly promoting recolonization and vegetation recovery through the frugivore's activity.",2016
How to be a dioecious fig: Chemical mimicry between sexes matters only when both sexes flower synchronously,,FLORAL SCENT; POLLINATOR SPECIFICITY; BLASTOPHAGA-PSENES; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; WASP MUTUALISM; FICUS-CARICA; SOUTH-AFRICA; PLANTS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,"In nursery pollination mutualisms, which are usually obligate interactions, olfactory attraction of pollinators by floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is the main step in guaranteeing partner encounter. However, mechanisms ensuring the evolutionary stability of dioecious fig-pollinator mutualisms, in which female fig trees engage in pollination by deceit resulting in zero reproductive success of pollinators that visit them, are poorly understood. In dioecious figs, individuals of each sex should be selected to produce odours that their pollinating wasps cannot distinguish, especially since pollinators have usually only one choice of a nursery during their lifetime. To test the hypothesis of intersexual chemical mimicry, VOCs emitted by pollen-receptive figs of seven dioecious species were compared using headspace collection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. First, fig-flower scents varied significantly among species, allowing host-species recognition. Second, in species in which male and female figs are synchronous, intersexual VOC variation was not significant. However, in species where figs of both sexes flower asynchronously, intersexual variation of VOCs was detectable. Finally, with one exception, there was no sexual dimorphism in scent quantity. We show that there are two ways to use scent to be a dioecious fig based on differences in flowering synchrony between the sexes.",2016
Does Traunsteinera globosa (the globe orchid) dupe its pollinators through generalized food deception or mimicry?,Batesian mimicry; floral signals; flower colour; fly pollination; nectar; Orchidaceae; pollination; pollinator efficiency; scent,FLORAL MIMICRY; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; COLOR PREFERENCES; BATESIAN MIMICRY; FLOWER VISITORS; SOUTH-AFRICA; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY,"Non-rewarding orchids rely on various ruses to attract their pollinators. One of the most common is for them to resemble flowers sought by insects as food sources. This can range from generalized food deception to the mimicry of specific sympatric food plants. We investigated the basis of pollinator deception in the European food-deceptive orchid Traunsteinera globosa, which has unusually compact flowerheads resembling those of sympatric rewarding species of Knautia and Scabiosa (Dipsacaceae), and Valeriana (Caprifoliaceae). Visual signals of T.globosa are similar in both fly and bee vision models to those of the sympatric food plants used in the choice experiments, but scent signals are divergent. Field experiments conducted in Austria and the Czech Republic showed that both naive and experienced (with respect to visitation of T.globosa) insect species approached the orchids at the same rate as food plants, but direct contact with orchid flowers was taxon specific. Flies were most easily duped into probing the orchid, and, in doing so, frequently received and deposited pollinaria, whereas most bees and butterflies avoided landing on orchid flowers. We conclude that T.globosa is a mimic of a guild of fly-pollinated plants, but the ecological dependence of the orchid on its models remains to be fully tested.",2016
Hairiness: the missing link between pollinators and pollination,Pollination; Pilosity; Entropy; Functional trait; Pollen deposition; Ecosystem function; Image analysis; Pollen load; SVD,FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; POLLEN; BEES; TRAIT; RESILIENCE; DEPOSITION; FRAMEWORK; ADHESION,"Background. Functional traits are the primary biotic component driving organism influence on ecosystem functions; in consequence, traits are widely used in ecological research. However, most animal trait-based studies use easy-to-measure characteristics of species that are at best only weakly associated with functions. Animal-mediated pollination is a key ecosystem function and is likely to be influenced by pollinator traits, but to date no one has identified functional traits that are simple to measure and have good predictive power. Methods. Here, we show that a simple, easy to measure trait (hairiness) can predict pollinator effectiveness with high accuracy. We used a novel image analysis method to calculate entropy values for insect body surfaces as a measure of hairiness. We evaluated the power of our method for predicting pollinator effectiveness by regressing pollinator hairiness (entropy) against single visit pollen deposition (SVD) and pollen loads on insects We used linear models and AICe model selection to determine which body regions were the best predictors of SVD and pollen load. Results. We found that hairiness can be fused as a robust proxy of SVD. The best models for predicting SVD for the flower species Brassica rapa and Actinidia deliciosa were hairiness on the face and thorax as predictors (R-2 = 0.98 and 0.91 respectively). The best model for predicting pollen load for B. rapa was hairiness on the face (R-2 = 0.81). Discussion. We suggest that the match between pollinator body region hairiness and plant reproductive structure morphology is a powerful predictor of pollinator effectiveness. We show that pollinator hairiness is strongly linked to pollination an important ecosystem function and provide a rigorous and time-efficient method for measuring hairiness. Identifying and accurately measuring key traits that drive ecosystem processes is critical as, global change increasingly alters ecological communities, and subsequently, ecosystem functions worldwide.",2016
Reproductive ecology and isolation of Psittacanthus calyculatus and P. auriculatus mistletoes (Loranthaceae),Allopatry; Bird pollination; Character displacement; Hemiparasites; Hummingbird; Mexico; Loranthaceae,HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED MISTLETOE; MATING SYSTEM; SCHIEDEANUS LORANTHACEAE; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; NEOTROPICAL MISTLETOES; NECTAR PRODUCTION; FLOWERING PLANTS; HOST-SPECIFICITY; CENTRAL VERACRUZ; CENTRAL MEXICO,"Background: Relationships between floral biology and pollinator behavior are important to understanding species diversity of hemiparasitic Psittacanthus mistletoes (c. 120 species). We aimed to investigate trait divergence linked to pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation (RI) in two hummingbird-pollinated and bird-dispersed Psittacanthus species with range overlap. Methods: We investigated the phylogenetic relationships, floral biology, pollinator assemblages, seed dispersers and host usage, and the breeding system and female reproductive success of two sympatric populations of P. calyculatus and P. auriculatus, and one allopatric population of P. calyculatus. Flowers in sympatry were also reciprocally pollinated to assess a post-mating component of RI. Results: Hummingbird assemblages differed between calyculatus populations, while allopatric plants of calyculatus opened more but smaller flowers with longer lifespans and produced less nectar than those in sympatry. Bayesian-based phylogenetic analysis indicated monophyly for calyculatus populations (i.e. both populations belong to the same species). In sympatry, calyculatus plants opened more and larger flowers with longer lifespans and produced same nectar volume than those of auriculatus; populations shared pollinators but seed dispersers and host usage differed between species. Nectar standing crops differed between sympatric populations, with lower visitation in calyculatus. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system, with fruit set after interspecific pollination two times higher from calyculatus to auriculatus than in the opposite direction. Conclusions: Given the low genetic differentiation between calyculatus populations, observed trait divergence could have resulted from changes regarding the local communities of pollinators and, therefore, expected divergence for peripheral, allopatric populations. Using RI estimates, there were fewer heterospecific matings than expected by chance in P. calyculatus (RI4A = 0.629) as compared to P. auriculatus (RI4A = 0.20). When considering other factors of ecological isolation that affect co-occurrence, the RI4C values indicate that isolation by hummingbird pollinators was less effective (0.20) than isolation by host tree species and seed dispersers (0.80 and 0.60, respectively), suggesting that host usage is the most important ecological isolation factor between the two species. Accordingly, the absolute and relative cumulative strength values indicated that the host tree species' barrier is currently contributing the most to maintaining these species in sympatry.",2016
Induced Floral and Extrafloral Nectar Production Affect Ant-pollinator Interactions and Plant Fitness,ant-pollinator conflict; indirect defenses; jasmonic acid; Phaseolus lunatus; seeds; defensas indirectas; acido jasmonico; semillas; conflicto hormiga-polinizador,FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ECOLOGICAL COSTS; INDIRECT DEFENSE; PARASITIC WASPS; SEED PRODUCTION; JASMONIC ACID; CONFLICTS; AVAILABILITY; CONSEQUENCES,"Thousands of plant species throughout tropical and temperate zones secrete extrafloral nectar to attract ants, whose presence provides an indirect defense against herbivores. Extrafloral nectaries are located close to flowers and may modify competition between ants and pollinators. Here, we used Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) to study the plants interaction between ants and flower visitors and its consequences for plant fitness. To test these objectives, we carried out two field experiments in which we manipulated the presence of ants and nectar production via induction with jasmonic acid (JA). We then measured floral and extrafloral nectar production, the number of patrolling ants and flower visitors as well as specific plant fitness traits. Lima bean plants under JA induction produced more nectar in both extrafloral nectaries and flowers, attracted more ants and produced more flowers and seeds than non-induced plants. Despite an increase in floral nectar in JA plants, application of this hormone had no significant effects on flower visitor attraction. Finally, ant presence did not result in a decrease in the number of visits, but our results suggest that ants could negatively affect pollination efficiency. In particular, JA-induced plants without ants produced a greater number of seeds compared with the JA-treated plants with ants. Resumen Miles de especies de plantas en zonas tropicales y templadas producen nectar extra floral con el fin de atraer hormigas, cuya presencia representa una defensa indirecta contra los herbivoros. Los nectarios extra florales se encuentran cerca de las flores y pueden generar conflictos entre hormigas y polinizadores. En el presente estudio utilizamos plantas de frijol Lima (Phaseolus lunatus L.) para investigar la interaccion entre hormigas y los visitantes de flores y sus consecuencias para la adecuacion de las plantas. Se llevaron a cabo dos experimentos en los cuales manipulamos la presencia de hormigas y la produccion de nectar a traves de la induccion con acido jasmonico. Se midio la produccion de nectar floral y extra floral, el numero de hormigas que patrullaban las plantas y el numero de visitantes florales, asi como algunos caracteres de las plantas. Las plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico produjeron mas nectar en ambas estructuras, atrajeron mas hormigas y produjeron mas flores y semillas que las plantas control, no inducidas. A pesar del aumento en el nectar floral en plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico, la aplicacion de esta hormona no tuvo efectos significativos sobre la atraccion de los polinizadores. Por ultimo, la presencia de hormigas no tuvo un efecto significativo sobre la abundancia de polinizadores. Sin embargo, nuestros resultados sugieren que la presencia de hormigas puede afectar negativamente la eficiencia de los polinizadores. Especificamente, las plantas inducidas con acido jasmonico en las que se excluyeron las hormigas, produjeron mas semillas que las plantas inducidas pero con presencia hormigas.",2016
Technique to detect flower-visiting insects in video monitoring and time-lapse photography data,ImageJ; interval photography; motion detection; plant-animal interaction; pollination biology,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; ORCHIDACEAE; JAPONICA,"Recent developments in video monitoring and time-lapse photography techniques have increased the efficiency of observing floral visitors. However, such approaches still require a great investment of time and effort to extract the relevant information from the large quantity of data produced. In an attempt to shorten this time-consuming process and make it more efficient, we have developed a system to automatically detect moving objects. This new system involves the comparison of consecutive frames to detect differences between the images and highlights those frames that are likely to contain insect visitors. The specifications of the system and the results from a pilot study using the data of the orchid species Platanthera ussuriensis are described below.",2016
Focal Plant Observations as a Standardised Method for Pollinator Monitoring: Opportunities and Limitations for Mass Participation Citizen Science,,BIOLOGICAL RECORDS CENTER; EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; DECLINES; GARDENS; SCALE; TOOL; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; BUMBLEBEES,"Background Recently there has been increasing focus on monitoring pollinating insects, due to concerns about their declines, and interest in the role of volunteers in monitoring pollinators, particularly bumblebees, via citizen science. Methodology / Principal Findings The Big Bumblebee Discovery was a one-year citizen science project run by a partnership of EDF Energy, the British Science Association and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology which sought to assess the influence of the landscape at multiple scales on the diversity and abundance of bumblebees. Timed counts of bumblebees (Bombus spp.; identified to six colour groups) visiting focal plants of lavender (Lavendula spp.) were carried out by about 13 000 primary school children (7-11 years old) from over 4000 schools across the UK. 3948 reports were received totalling 26 868 bumblebees. We found that while the wider landscape type had no significant effect on reported bumblebee abundance, the local proximity to flowers had a significant effect (fewer bumblebees where other flowers were reported to be >5m away from the focal plant). However, the rate of mis-identifcation, revealed by photographs uploaded by participants and a photo-based quiz, was high. Conclusions / Significance Our citizen science results support recent research on the importance of local flocal resources on pollinator abundance. Timed counts of insects visiting a lure plant is potentially an effective approach for standardised pollinator monitoring, engaging a large number of participants with a simple protocol. However, the relatively high rate of mis-identifications (compared to reports from previous pollinator citizen science projects) highlights the importance of investing in resources to train volunteers. Also, to be a scientifically valid method for enquiry, citizen science data needs to be sufficiently high quality, so receiving supporting evidence (such as photographs) would allow this to be tested and for records to be verified.",2016
Do Not Divide Count Data with Count Data; A Story from Pollination Ecology with Implications Beyond,,SPECIES RICHNESS; PLANTS; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; SELECTION; DECLINES; MODELS; TRENDS,"Studies in ecology are often describing observed variations in a certain ecological phenomenon by use of environmental explanatory variables. A common problem is that the numerical nature of the ecological phenomenon does not always fit the assumptions underlying traditional statistical tests. A text book example comes from pollination ecology where flower visits are normally reported as frequencies; number of visits per flower per unit time. Using visitation frequencies in statistical analyses comes with two major caveats: the lack of knowledge on its error distribution and that it does not include all information found in the data; 10 flower visits in 20 flowers is treated the same as recording 100 visits in 200 flowers. We simulated datasets with various ""flower visitation distributions"" over various numbers of flowers observed (exposure) and with different types of effects inducing variation in the data. The different datasets were then analyzed first with the traditional approach using number of visits per flower and then by using count data models. The analysis of count data gave a much better chance of detecting effects than the traditionally used frequency approach. We conclude that if the data structure, statistical analyses and interpretations of results are mixed up, valuable information can be lost.",2016

Here, we report on a study of the pollination of two species from the Cleistocactus genus, cited as an ornithophilous genus, in the context of the different ways in which they are specialised to bird pollination. In addition, we re-evaluate the level of specialisation of previous studies of cacti with bird pollination and evaluate how common phenotypic specialisation to birds is in this family. Both Cleistocactus species exhibited ornithophilous floral traits. Cleistocactus baumannii was pollinated by hummingbirds, whereas Cleistocactus smaragdiflorus was pollinated by hummingbirds and bees. Pollination by birds has been recorded in 27 cactus species, many of which exhibit ornithophilous traits; however, they show generalised pollination systems with bees, bats or moths in addition to birds being their floral visitors. Of all cactus species, 27% have reddish flowers. This trait is associated with diurnal anthesis and a tubular shape. Phenotypic specialisation to bird pollination is recognised in many cactus species; however, it is not predictive of functional and ecological specialisation in this family.",2016
Nectar robbing impacts pollinator behavior but not plant reproduction,,IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA POLEMONIACEAE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; POLLEN LIMITATION; TROPHIC CASCADES; MATING SYSTEM; FITNESS; ROBBERS; HUMMINGBIRDS; REDUCE; SHRUB,"Trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) refer to interactions in which the effect of one species on another is mediated by the behavior of a third species. A mechanistic approach that identifies the direction and impact of TMIEs can shed light on why different net outcomes are observed in the same general phenomena across systems. Nectar robbing has variable net effects through TMIEs on animal-pollinated plants across systems, but the mechanistic steps underlying this range of outcomes are often unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed linkages between nectar robbing, pollinator behavior and plant reproductive success in the Andean tree, Oreocallis grandiflora. We found that robbing in this system led to lower nectar volumes, higher nectar sucrose concentration, and higher nectar viscosity, which together negatively impact nectar quality. This drop in nectar quality was associated with decreased visitation rates by hummingbirds, which might be expected to impact plant reproduction negatively by pollen limitation. However, it was also associated with increased diversity (Shannon's) and evenness in the pollinator community due to reduced visitation by a territorial hummingbird, which might be expected to impact reproduction positively via enhanced genetic diversity of pollen as non-territorial pollinators forage over greater areas. We measured seed set and mass to distinguish the relative intensity of these two possible outcomes, but found no detectable effect. We tentatively conclude that these two consequences of TMIEs may have balanced each other out to yield a neutral net effect of nectar robbing on plant reproduction, though other explanations are also possible. This study highlights ways in which ecologically important TMIEs may act in opposing directions to mask important ecological forces, and underscores the continued need for detailed study of the mechanisms through which TMIEs operate.",2016

Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in collecting of scientific data, can be a useful research tool. However, data collected by volunteers are often of lower quality than those collected by professional scientists. 2. We studied the accuracy with which the volunteers identified insects visiting ivy (Hedera) flowers in Sussex, England. In the first experiment, we examined the effects of training method, volunteer background and prior experience. Fifty-three participants were trained for the same duration using one of three different methods (pamphlet, pamphlet + slide show or pamphlet + direct training). Almost immediately following training, we tested the ability of the participants to identify live insects on ivy flowers to one of 10 taxonomic categories and recorded whether their identifications were correct or incorrect, without providing feedback. 3. The results showed that the type of training method had a significant effect on identification accuracy (P = 0.008). Participants identified 79.1% of insects correctly after using a one-page colour pamphlet, 85.6% correctly after using the pamphlet and viewing a slide show and 94.3% correctly after using the pamphlet in combination with direct training in the field. 4. As direct training cannot be delivered remotely, in the following year we conducted a second experiment, in which a different sample of 26 volunteers received the pamphlet plus slide show training repeatedly three times. Moreover, in this experiment, participants received c. 2 min of additional training material, either videos of insects or stills taken from the videos. Testing showed that identification accuracy increased from 88.6% to 91.3% to 97.5% across the three successive tests. We also found a borderline significant interaction between the type of additional material and the test number (P = 0.053), such that the video gave fewer errors than stills in the first two tests only. 5. The most common errors made by volunteers were misidentifications of honeybees and social wasps with their hover fly mimics. We also tested six experts who achieved nearly perfect accuracy (99.8%), which shows what is possible in practice. 6. Overall, our study shows that two or three sessions of remote training can be as good as one of direct training, even for relatively challenging taxonomic discriminations that include distinguishing models and mimics.",2016
Experimental evidence of pollination in marine flowers by invertebrate fauna,,THALASSIA-TESTUDINUM HYDROCHARITACEAE; POLLEN; SEAGRASS; ANGIOSPERMS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,"Pollen transport by water-flow (hydrophily) is a typical, and almost exclusive, adaptation of plants to life in the marine environment. It is thought that, unlike terrestrial environments, animals are not involved in pollination in the sea. The male flowers of the tropical marine angiosperm Thalassia testudinum open-up and release pollen in mucilage at night when invertebrate fauna is active. Here we present experimental evidence that, in the absence of water-flow, these invertebrates visit the flowers, carry and transfer mucilage mass with embedded pollen from the male flowers to the stigmas of the female flowers. Pollen tubes are formed on the stigmas, indicating that pollination is successful. Thus, T. testudinum has mixed abiotic-biotic pollination. We propose a zoobenthophilous pollination syndrome (pollen transfer in the benthic zone by invertebrate animals) which shares many characteristics with hydrophily, but flowers are expected to open-up during the night.",2016
Floral colours in a world without birds and bees: the plants of Macquarie Island,Chromatic signal; floral colour; fly pollination; hoverfly (Eristalis); sub-Antarctic island,FLOWER COLOR; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; HONEY-BEES; EVOLUTION; VISION; DISCRIMINATION; ECOLOGY; ALPINE; COMMUNITIES; PREFERENCE,"We studied biotically pollinated angiosperms on Macquarie Island, a remote site in the Southern Ocean with a predominately or exclusively dipteran pollinator fauna, in an effort to understand how flower colour affects community assembly. We compared a distinctive group of cream-green Macquarie Island flowers to the flora of likely source pools of immigrants and to a continental flora from a high latitude in the northern hemisphere. We used both dipteran and hymenopteran colour models and phylogenetically informed analyses to explore the chromatic component of community assembly. The species with cream-green flowers are very restricted in colour space models of both fly vision and bee vision and represent a distinct group that plays a very minor role in other communities. It is unlikely that such a community could form through random immigration from continental source pools. Our findings suggest that fly pollination has imposed a strong ecological filter on Macquarie Island, favouring floral colours that are rare in continental floras. This is one of the strongest demonstrations that plant-pollinator interactions play an important role in plant community assembly. Future work exploring colour choices by dipteran flower visitors would be valuable.",2016
Life-Long Radar Tracking of Bumblebees,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; HARMONIC RADAR; HONEY-BEES; ECOLOGY; DANCE; PERFORMANCE; ONTOGENY; CHOICE; SPEED; WIND,"Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many ecosystems, so it is important to understand their foraging movements on a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour changed with experience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We identified how each bee's flights fit into two categories-which we named exploration and exploitation flights-examining the differences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees' foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can be made throughout the bee's foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance exploration of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal extreme levels of variation between individuals.",2016
A paradoxical mismatch between interspecific pollinator moves and heterospecific pollen receipt in a natural community,alpine meadow; ecological network; heterospecific pollen transfer; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen carryover; pollinator interspecific move,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FLOWER CONSTANCY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; CARRYOVER; FITNESS; SYSTEMS; CONSEQUENCES; HUMMINGBIRDS; ARCHITECTURE,"Pollinators visiting multiple plant species may cause heterospecific pollen transfer (HPT). To test a null model that more pollinator interspecific moves result in higher HPT among interacting species, we quantified the comparative magnitudes of the two networks involving 14 co-flowering species in an alpine meadow in the eastern Himalaya, southwest China. Interspecific moves accounted for 4% of the total visits, whereas heterospecific pollen constituted 22% of the total stigmatic pollen loads. On average, plant species received interspecific moves and HPT from 6.9 and 9.7 other species, respectively. Although the two networks were largely concordant, 21.6% of interspecific move links were not correspondingly linked by HPT, and 44.1% of heterospecific pollen transfer links were not linked by moves. Plant species with more outgoing pollinator moves tended to disperse more of their own pollen to others, as expected. Surprisingly, our data reveal that plant species which received more pollinator moves from other species tended to receive less HP, implying that only species with low acceptance of HP were likely to permit frequent pollinator moves. These new findings unveil a paradoxical relation between pollinator interspecific moves and HP receipt, suggesting an adaptive strategy of co-flowering species that reduces deleterious effects of HPT.",2016
Climate change and ecosystem services,,CHANGE IMPACTS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; POLLINATED PLANTS; CARBON-CYCLE; GLOBAL OCEAN; ADAPTATION; AGRICULTURE; BIODIVERSITY; TEMPERATURE; TOURISM,"Studies of the impacts of climate change cover three broad areas: direct effects on humans, their enterprises, and assets; effects on natural systems; and effects on humans via natural systems. Ecosystem services' fall into the latter category. Future climates continue to allow ecosystem services to be delivered and consumed, in some cases at a level greater than in the past, and in others degraded relative to their historic supply. Across a wide range of ecosystem services, the losses exceed the gains for magnitudes and rates of climate change projected under low-mitigation scenarios. On balance, global mean temperature (GMT) rises greater than 2 degrees C above preindustrial have a spatially patchy but net negative effect on many ecosystem services. The negative impacts occur in many places and affect most people. This apparent asymmetry of impact is hypothesized to have three causes: the rapidity of climate change relative to adaptive processes in social and ecological systems; the exposure of societies to climates not experienced during the period over which complex, agriculturally dependent human societies developed; and the approach toward limits in the Earth system. Covariates of climate changeespecially rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and ongoing land transformationare an inextricable part of the projected loss of services in the coming century and the projected shortfall between supply and demand is strongly demand-driven. The geographical distributions of ecosystem service supply and demand are unequal, and becoming more so.

Fruiting Strategies of Perennial Plants: A Resource Budget Model to Couple Mast Seeding to Pollination Efficiency and Resource Allocation Strategies,masting; resource budget model; fruit set; fruit size; sex allocation; pollination efficiency,POLLEN-LIMITATION; WIND POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST TREES; PATTERNS; SYNCHRONY; FLOWER; SCALE,"Masting, a breeding strategy common in perennial plants, is defined by seed production that is highly variable over years and synchronized at the population level. Resource budget models (RBMs) proposed that masting relies on two processes: (i) the depletion of plant reserves following high fruiting levels, which leads to marked temporal fluctuations in fruiting; and (ii) outcross pollination that synchronizes seed crops among neighboring trees. We revisited the RBM approach to examine the extent to which masting could be impacted by the degree of pollination efficiency, by taking into account various logistic relationships between pollination success and pollen availability. To link masting to other reproductive traits, we split the reserve depletion coefficient into three biological parameters related to resource allocation strategies for flowering and fruiting. While outcross pollination is considered to be the key mechanism that synchronizes fruiting in RBMs, our model counterintuitively showed that intense masting should arise under low-efficiency pollination. When pollination is very efficient, medium-level masting may occur, provided that the costs of female flowering (relative to pollen production) and of fruiting (maximum fruit set and fruit size) are both very high. Our work highlights the powerful framework of RBMs, which include explicit biological parameters, to link fruiting dynamics to various reproductive traits and to provide new insights into the reproductive strategies of perennial plants.",2016
Effects of florivory on plant-pollinator interactions: Implications for male and female components of plant reproduction,florivory; floral herbivory; pollination; indirect effects; pollen transfer,GELSEMIUM-SEMPERVIRENS LOGANIACEAE; FLORAL HERBIVORY; POLLEN FLOW; ISOMERIS-ARBOREA; DEPRESSARIA-PASTINACELLA; NEMOPHILA-MENZIESII; SOLANUM-CAROLINENSE; ECOLOGICAL COSTS; SCARLET-GILIA; FITNESS,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Florivory could have direct negative effects on plant fitness due to consumption of floral organs, and indirect effects mediated through changes in traits important to pollination. These effects likely vary with plant sexual system, depending on sex- or morph-specific patterns of damage. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of simulated florivory on male and female components of reproduction in the native, distylous vine Gelsemium sempervirens. METHODS: We crossed floral damage and supplemental pollination treatments in a common garden array and tracked pollinator behavioral responses. We also estimated male function using fluorescent dye as an analog for pollen transfer, and measured both fruit and seed production. KEY RESULTS: The effects of floral damage varied by floral morph, the genus of floral visitor, and the component of reproduction measured. Damage reduced the number of pollinator visits to pin but not thrum plants, and increased the time some pollinators spent per flower in thrum but not pin plants. Flowers of damaged plants transferred more dye particles to recipient plants compared to undamaged plants, but only later in the season when the majority of dye transfer occurred. Damage had no effect on female reproduction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that florivory can have positive indirect effects on estimated male plant reproduction through changes in different pollinators' behavior at flowers, but the effects of floral damage vary with male vs. female function. These results underscore the importance of other species' interactions at flowers in driving pollinator behavior and pollen transfer dynamics.",2016
"Floral asymmetry and predation risk modify pollinator behavior, but only predation risk decreases plant fitness",Trait-mediated indirect interaction; Mutualism; Plant reproductive success; Flowering plant evolution; Path analysis,CRAB SPIDERS; POLLEN LIMITATION; INTERACTION WEBS; FLOWERS; HERBIVORY; CONSEQUENCES; REPRODUCTION; VISITATION; SYMMETRY; PREFERENCES,"Although predators and floral herbivores can potentially decrease plant fitness by changing pollinator behaviors, studies comparing the strength of these factors as well as their additive and interactive effects on pollinator visitation and plant fitness have not been conducted. In this study, we manipulated the floral symmetry and predator presence (artificial crab spiders) on the flowers of the shrub Rubus rosifolius (Rosaceae) in a 2 x 2 factorial randomized block design. We found that asymmetry and predators decreased pollinator visitation (mainly hymenopterans), and overall these factors did not interact (additive effects). The effect of predation risk on pollinator avoidance behavior was 62 % higher than that of floral asymmetry. Furthermore, path analyses revealed that only predation risk cascaded down to plant fitness, and it significantly decreased fruit biomass by 33 % and seed number by 28 %. We also demonstrated that R. rosifolius fitness is indirectly affected by visiting and avoidance behaviors of pollinators. The strong avoidance behavioral response triggered by predation risk may be related to predator pressure upon flowers. Although floral asymmetry caused by herbivory can alter the quality of resources, it should not exert the same evolutionary pressure as that of predator-prey interactions. Our study highlights the importance of considering simultaneous forces, such as predation risk and floral asymmetry, as well as pollinator behavior when evaluating ecological processes involving mutualistic plant-pollinator systems.",2016
Flexible foraging shapes the topology of plant-pollinator interaction networks,adaptive foraging; competition; complementary specialization; complex adaptive system; flexible foraging; interaction switching; modularity; nestedness; niche partitioning; optimal foraging,SPECIES INTERACTION NETWORKS; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB COMPLEXITY; COMPLEMENTARITY; NESTEDNESS; STABILITY; ARCHITECTURE; COMPETITION; COMPARTMENTALIZATION; SPECIALIZATION,"In plant-pollinator networks, foraging choices by pollinators help form the connecting links between species. Flexible foraging should therefore play an important role in defining network topology. Factors such as morphological trait complementarity limit a pollinator's pool of potential floral resources, but which potential resource species are actually utilized at a location depends on local environmental and ecological context. Pollinators can be highly flexible foragers, but the effect of this flexibility on network topology remains unclear. To understand how flexible foraging affects network topology, we examined differences between sets of locally realized interactions and corresponding sets of potential interactions within 25 weighted plant-pollinator networks in two different regions of the United States. We examined two possible mechanisms for flexible foraging effects on realized networks: (1) preferential targeting of higher-density plant resources, which should increase network nestedness, and (2) context-dependent resource partitioning driven by interspecific competition, which should increase modularity and complementary specialization. We found that flexible foraging has strong effects on realized network topology. Realized connectance was much lower than connectance based on potential interactions, indicating a local narrowing of diet breadth. Moreover, the foraging choices pollinators made, which particular plant species to visit and at what rates, resulted in networks that were significantly less nested and significantly more modular and specialized than their corresponding networks of potential interactions. Preferentially foraging on locally abundant resources was not a strong driver of the realization of potential interactions. However, the degree of modularity and complementary specialization both increased with the number of competing pollinator species and with niche availability. We therefore conclude that flexible foraging affects realized network topology more strongly through resource partitioning than through focusing on high-density resources.",2016
Dual Effect of Phenolic Nectar on Three Floral Visitors of Elsholtzia rugulosa (Lamiaceae) in SW China,,4-HYDROXYBENZOIC ACID; TOXIC NECTAR; SALICYLIC-ACID; PLANT; HONEYS; COMPONENTS; MODULATE; FLOWERS; FILTER; BIRD,"Some plants secrete toxic nectar to appeal to most effective pollinators and deter non-pollinators or nectar thieves; however available information about ecological function of toxic nectar remains scarce. Elsholtzia rugulosa stands out as a plant with toxic nectar recorded in SW China. We focused on the functional significance of the phenolic compound that imparts toxic to the nectar of E. rugulosa. The effects of phenolic nectar were studied in three visitors of the flowers of the winter-blooming E. rugulosa Hemsl. (Lamiaceae) in SW China. The pollinating species Apis cerana Fabricius (Apidae; Asian honey bee) and two occasional visitors, Vespa velutina Lepeletier (Vespidae; yellow-legged Asian hornet) and Bombus eximius Smith (Apidae; a bumble bee) were tested for their preferences for low and high concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in hexose and sucrose solutions. The pollinator is important for the plant, which is dependent on pollinator visits to attain a higher seed production and it is most likely that the combination of phenolic toxic nectar and the adaptation to phenolic nectar by A. cerana delivers an evolutionary advantage to both actors. The low and high concentrations of the phenolic acid were nearly totally refused by both occasional visitors V. velutina and B. eximius and were preferred by the pollinator A. cerana. E. rugulosa gains by having a much higher seed production and the pollinating honey bee by having an exclusive and reliable food source during the winter season at high altitudes in SW China. We found that the function of the toxic phenolic compound has dual roles by appealing to legitimate pollinators and deterring non-pollinators of E. rugulosa.",2016
Delivery of floral resources and pollination services on farmland under three different wildlife-friendly schemes,Agri-environment scheme; Bees; Ecosystem services; Flowers; Organic farming; Pollinator; Phytometer,PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; BEE ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; BUMBLEBEES; DECLINES; CONSERVATION; IMPACTS; CROPS,"Management that enhances floral resources can be an effective way to support pollinators and pollination services. Some wildlife-friendly farming schemes aim to enhance the density and diversity of floral resources in non-crop habitats on farms, whilst managing crop fields intensively. Others, such as organic farming, aim to support ecological processes within both crop and non-crop habitats. How effective these different approaches are for supporting pollination services at the farm scale is unknown. We compared organic farming with two non-organic wildlife-friendly farming schemes: one prescriptive (Conservation Grade, CG) and one flexible (Entry Level Stewardship, ELS), and sampled a representative selection of crop and non-crop habitats. We investigated the spatial distribution and overall level of: (i) flower density and diversity, (ii) pollinator density and diversity and (iii) pollination services provided to Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) potted phytometer plants. Organic crop habitats supported a higher density of flowers, insect-wildflower visits, and fruit set of phytometers than CG or ELS crop habitats. Non-crop habitats supported a higher density of flowers and insect-flower visits than crop habitats on CG and ELS farms. Pollination services were higher on organic farms overall compared to CG or ELS. Pollinator diversity and density did not differ between schemes, at the point or farm level. CG farms received the highest total number of insect-wildflower visits. The findings support organic farming practices that increase floral resources in crop habitats, such as sowing clover or reduced herbicide usage, as mechanisms to enhance pollination services. However trade-offs with other ecosystem services are likely and these are discussed. The findings support the CG scheme as a way of supporting pollinators within farms where high wheat yields are required.    ",2016

In some cases, molecular pathways contributing to floral attraction are well characterized, offering the opportunity to explore loci potentially underlying variation among individuals. Here, we quantify the range of variation in floral UV patterning (i.e. UV bulls-eye nectar guides) among crop and wild accessions of Brassica rapa. We then use experimental crosses to examine the genetic architecture, candidate loci and biochemical underpinnings of this patterning as well as phenotypic manipulations to test the ecological impact. We find qualitative variation in UV patterning between wild (commonly lacking UV patterns) and crop (commonly exhibiting UV patterns) accessions. Similar to the majority of crops, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an oilseed cropxWI fast-plant((R)) cross exhibit UV patterns, the size of which varies extensively among genotypes. In RILs, we further observe strong statistical-genetic and QTL correlations within petal morphological traits and within measurements of petal UV patterning; however, correlations between morphology and UV patterning are weak or nonsignificant, suggesting that UV patterning is regulated and may evolve independently of overall petal size. HPLC analyses reveal a high concentration of sinapoyl glucose in UV-absorbing petal regions, which, in concert with physical locations of UV-trait QTLs, suggest a regulatory and structural gene as candidates underlying observed quantitative variation. Finally, insects prefer flowers with UV bulls-eye patterns over those that lack patterns, validating the importance of UV patterning in pollen-limited populations of B.rapa.",2016
Effects of nectar robbing on male and female reproductive success of a pollinator-dependent plant,Lonicera etrusca; plant-animal interactions; plant mating sytems; pollination; reproductive success; floral larceny; nectar robber; floral visitor behaviour; pollen donation; fruit set; seed/ovule ratio; seed weight,MACLEANIA-BULLATA ERICACEAE; CORYDALIS-AMBIGUA; FLORAL VISITORS; POLLEN TRANSFER; GLOBAL CHANGE; FRUIT-SET; ROBBERS; FITNESS; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY,"Background and Aims Nectar robbers affect host fitness in different ways and by different magnitudes, both directly and indirectly, and potentially constitute an important part of pollination interactions. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of nectar robbing on several variables that characterize the reproductive success of Lonicera etrusca, a pollinator-dependent plant with long, tubular flowers that produce abundant nectar. Methods Using fluorescent powder dye as a proxy for pollen, the distance of pollen dispersal was compared for robbed and non-robbed flowers. Artificial nectar robbing treatments were applied to test its effects on four additional measures of reproductive success, namely the quantity of pollen exported, fruit set, seed/ovule ratio and seed weight. Key Results Nectar robbing was not found to have any significant negative consequences on female and male components of reproductive success as determined through the five variables that were measured. Conclusions Although L. etrusca exhibits high levels of nectar robbing and nectar robbers are common floral visitors, no evidence was found of detrimental changes in the components of reproductive success. A combination of morphological and ecological mechanisms is proposed to explain how plants may compensate for the energetic loss caused by the nectar robbers.",2016
Leaf and floral heating in cold climates: do sub-Antarctic megaherbs resemble tropical alpine giants?,Campbell Island; flower colour; thermal imaging; Pleurophyllum speciosum,HIGH ARCTIC FLOWERS; CAMPBELL ISLAND; NEW-ZEALAND; LIFE-FORMS; PLANT; ECOLOGY; POLLINATION; PUBESCENCE; VEGETATION; EVOLUTION,"High latitude and altitude floras are characterized by low-statured, small, wind-pollinated plants, which mainly reproduce by self-pollination or asexual reproduction. However, at odds with this are some sub-Antarctic islands that have plant species with giant growth forms and large, brightly coloured flowers which require insect visitation for pollination. The size, colour and shape of the inflorescences and leaves of these megaherbs suggest thermal benefits similar to giant tropical alpine plants of equatorial Africa, South America and Hawaii. We evaluated whether heating occurs in sub-Antarctic megaherbs, and to what extent it is related to environmental variables. We measured leaf and inflorescence temperature in six sub-Antarctic megaherb species on Campbell Island, latitude 52.3 degrees S, New Zealand Biological Region. Using thermal imaging techniques, in combination with measurement of solar radiation, ambient air temperature, wind speed, wind chill and humidity, we assessed environmental influences on leaf and floral heating. We found that leaf and inflorescence temperatures of all megaherbs were higher than simultaneously measured ambient temperatures. Greatest heating was seen in Pleurophyllum speciosum, with observed leaves 9 degrees C higher, and inflorescences nearly 11 degrees C higher, than ambient temperature. Heating was highly correlated with brief, unpredictable periods of solar radiation, and occurred most rapidly in species with hairy, corrugated leaves and darkly pigmented, densely packed inflorescences. This is the first evidence that floral and leaf heating occurs in sub-Antarctic megaherbs, and suggests that leaf hairiness, flower colour and shape could provide thermal benefits like those seen in tropical alpine megaherbs.",2016
Contrasting pollination ecology of Disepalum species (Annonaceae): evolutionary loss of the floral chamber and partial breakdown of protogyny associated with a shift in pollination system,fruit fly; meliponine bee; nitidulid beetle; pollination ecology; prolonged anthesis,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; RECEPTIVITY; ANGIOSPERM; FAMILY; BEES,"Disepalum comprises two monophyletic sister subgenera, Enicosanthellum and Disepalum, with strikingly different floral morphologies: the former has two whorls of unfused sepals, forming a partially enclosed floral chamber, whereas the latter possesses a single whorl of congenitally fused petals and lacks a floral chamber. The pollination ecologies of representative species are reported, including assessments of floral phenloogy, pollinators and floral thermogenesis. Disepalum pulchrum (subgenus Enicosanthellum) has hermaphroditic flowers with a pollination chamber and is protogynous with prolonged anthesis; it is pollinated by nitidulid beetles and drosophilid flies. Disepalum anomalum (subgenus Disepalum) is also hermaphroditic with prolonged anthesis, but has incomplete protogyny due to overlapping pistillate and staminate phases; it is pollinated by meliponine bees, which are attracted by the pollen, but which are only able to transfer pollen to receptive stigmas during the overlap phase. Alternative evolutionary hypotheses are evaluated, including the possibility that the ancestor of the subgenus Disepalum lineage may have experienced a profound genetic mutation, possibly involving genes responsible for organ merism and fusion, resulting in the loss of the pollination chamber and hence favouring different floral visitors. The breakdown in protogyny required for effective pollination is likely to have had significant ramifications on population genetic diversity.",2016
Does intraspecific behavioural variation of pollinator species influence pollination? A quantitative study with hummingbirds and a Neotropical shrub,Amazilia fimbriata; Cerrado; Palicourea rigida; pollen tube; pollinator efficacy; Rubiaceae; territorial behaviour,MONTANE CLOUD FOREST; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; NECTAR PRODUCTION; POLLEN DISPERSAL; PLANT; RUBIACEAE; ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; HELICONIA; NETWORK,"Floral visitors differ in their efficacy as pollinators, and the impact of different pollinator species on pollen flow and plant reproduction has been frequently evaluated. In contrast, the impact of intraspecific behavioural changes on their efficacy as pollinators has seldom been quantified. We studied a self-incompatible shrub Palicourea rigida (Rubiaceae) and its hummingbird pollinators, which adjust their behaviour according to floral resource availability. Fluorescence microscopy was used to access pollen tube growth and incompatibility reaction in pistils after a single visit of territorial or intruder hummingbirds in two populations. To characterise the plant populations and possible differences in resource availability between areas we used a three-term quadrat variance method to detect clusters of floral resources. Within-species variation in foraging behaviour, but not species identity, affected pollinator efficacy. Effectively, hummingbirds intruding into territories deposited more compatible pollen grains on P. rigida stigmas than territory holders in both study areas. Additionally, territory holders deposited more incompatible than compatible pollen grains. Our results imply that intraspecific foraging behaviour variation has consequences for pollination success. Quantifying such variation and addressing the implications of intraspecific variability contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics and consequences of plant-pollinator interactions.",2016

We collected 31 palm inflorescences of at least three individuals per species from three different regions of across the distribution of the palms (Colombian Andes, Amazon and Choco). Sixty thousand visiting insect individuals were collected, 53% of which correspond to 17 different Mystrops morphospecies. The average number of pollinator species was highest in W. fascicularis (five species) and lowest in W. drudei (one species). We found high specificity between the Mystrops assemblages and Wettinia spp. and, in general terms, one primary visitor per Wettinia sp. These results confirm previous reports of a strong mutualistic relationship between Arecaceae and Mystrops. Using inference of environmental niches, we found Wettinia spp. to be segregated along their distribution on climatic gradients. Finally, we found that climate has an important role in shaping pollinator species turnover, even after controlling for spatial distance, and that phylogenetic relatedness also has a positive effect on turnover of Mystrops spp. ",2016
"Flowering phenology of Mouriri guianensis (Melastomataceae) and its interaction with the crepusclar bee Megalopta amoena (Halictidae) in the restinga Lencois Maranhenses National Park, Brazil",Pollination; insect-plant interaction; floral oil; crepuscular foraging,SWEAT BEES; EVOLUTION; COMPETITORS; POLLINATION; HYMENOPTERA; VISITORS; ECOLOGY; FOREST; PANAMA; TREES,"Mouriri guianensis is a Brazilian endemic plant species distributed throughout the Amazon forest, Caatinga, Mata Atlantica and Cerrado domains, extending northward into Venezuela. The aim of this study was to describe the flowering phenology, floral biology and visitors associated with M. guianensis, highlighting the crepuscular bee species Megalopta amoena. Mouriri guianensis flowers from September to March. The flowering, the details of floral biology and the activities of floral visitors were observed for ten individual plants in December 2013, January-March 2014, September-December 2014 and January March 2015. The flowering peaks occurred in December 2013 and in November-December 2014. Bees were collected in January and February 2015. A total of 86 individuals belonging to six bee species were recorded visiting the flowers, with Xylocopa cearensis making more than one-half of the visits (60%), followed by Melipona subnitida and Megalopta amoena with 21.17% and 9.41% of the visits, respectively. The visitors showed activity peaks between 5:00 and 6:00 AM (66.27%). Buzz pollination was their predominant behavior. Megalopta amoena used its jaws to open the pore and the anther gland. Melipona subnitida used parts of the glands to seal the entrance to the colony. The visitors, except for Augochlopsis sp. and Trigona sp., are pollinators of M guianensis. Plants having an extended anthesis can attract visitors both day and night. In this study, we present an example of a crepuscular pollination system. We suggest that blooming at twilight is a strategy used by the plant to escape unsuitable visitors.",2016
Specialist pollinators deplete pollen in the spring ephemeral wildflower Claytonia virginica,Fly pollination; oligolectic bees; plant-pollinator specialization and generalization; pollen collectors; pollination,BUMBLE-BEES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SEASONAL-VARIATION; FLORAL DISPLAY; SEED SET; VISITATION; VISITORS; APOIDEA; PLANT; HYMENOPTERA,"Pollinators that collect pollen - and specifically, pollen-specialist bees - are often considered to be the best pollinators of a (host) plant. Although pollen collectors and pollen specialists often benefit host plants, especially in the pollen that they deliver (their pollination ""effectiveness""), they can also exact substantial costs because they are motivated to collect as much pollen as possible, reducing the proportion of pollen removed that is subsequently delivered to stigmas (their pollination ""efficiency""). From the plant perspective, pollen grains that do not pollinate conspecific stigmas are ""wasted"", and potentially costly. We measured costs and benefits of nectar-collecting, pollen-collecting, and pollen-specialist pollinator visitation to the spring ephemeral Claytonia virginica. Visits by the pollen-specialist bee Andrena erigeniae depleted pollen quickly and thoroughly. Although all pollinators delivered roughly the same number of grains, the pollen specialist contributed most to C. virginica pollen delivery because of high visitation rates. However, the pollen specialist also removed a large number of grains; this removal may be especially costly because it resulted in the depletion of pollen grains in C. virginica populations. While C. virginica appears to rely on pollen transfer by the pollen specialist in these populations, nectar-collecting visitors could provide the same benefit at a lower cost if their visitation rates increased. Pollen depletion affects a pollinator's value to plants, but is frequently overlooked. If they lower the effectiveness of future floral visitors, visits by A. erigeniae females to C. virginica may be more detrimental than beneficial compared to other pollinators and may, in some circumstances, reduce plant fitness rather than increase it. Therefore, A. erigeniae and C. virginica may vary in their degree of mutualism depending on the ecological context.",2016
Floral specialization for different pollinators and divergent use of the same pollinator among co-occurring Impatiens species (Balsaminaceae) from Southeast Asia,autogamy; bee pollination; butterfly pollination; floral asymmetry; nectar robbing; nectar spur; pollen placement; sympatry; tropics,CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BALSAM; WESTERN-GHATS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPATIAL VARIATION; DIVERSITY; FLOWERS; SYSTEMS; DIVERSIFICATION; ANGIOSPERMS; PEDICULARIS,"Floral variation among closely related species is thought to often reflect differences in pollination systems. Flowers of the large genus Impatiens are characterized by extensive variation in colour, shape and size and in anther and stigma positioning, but studies of their pollination ecology are scarce and most lack a comparative context. Consequently, the function of floral diversity in Impatiens remains enigmatic. This study documents floral variation and pollination of seven co-occurring Impatiens spp. in the Southeast Asian diversity hotspot. To assess whether floral trait variation reflects specialization for different pollination systems, we tested whether species depend on pollinators for reproduction, identified animals that visit flowers, determined whether these visitors play a role in pollination and quantified and compared key floral traits, including floral dimensions and nectar characteristics. Experimental exclusion of insects decreased fruit and seed set significantly for all species except I.muscicola, which also received almost no visits from animals. Most species received visits from several animals, including bees, birds, butterflies and hawkmoths, only a subset of which were effective pollinators. Impatiens psittacina, I.kerriae, I.racemosa and I.daraneenae were pollinated by bees, primarily Bombus haemorrhoidalis. Impatiens chiangdaoensis and I.santisukii had bimodal pollination systems which combined bee and lepidopteran pollination. Floral traits differed significantly among species with different pollination systems. Autogamous flowers were small and spurless, and did not produce nectar; bee-pollinated flowers had short spurs and large floral chambers with a wide entrance; and bimodally bee- and lepidopteran-pollinated species had long spurs and a small floral chamber with a narrow entrance. Nectar-producing species with different pollination systems did not differ in nectar volume and sugar concentration. Despite the high frequency of bee pollination in co-occurring species, individuals with a morphology suggestive of hybrid origin were rare. Variation in floral architecture, including various forms of corolla asymmetry, facilitates distinct, species-specific pollen-placement on visiting bees. Our results show that floral morphological diversity among Impatiens spp. is associated with both differences in functional pollinator groups and divergent use of the same pollinator. Non-homologous mechanisms of floral asymmetry are consistent with repeated independent evolution, suggesting that competitive interactions among species with the same pollination system have been an important driver of floral variation among Impatiens spp.",2016

Although thermoregulation by large bees in cool climates has been well studied, less is known about the very different thermoregulatory strategies of small bees, especially those subjected to heat stress. 2. Studies were carried out on small (< 20 mg fresh weight), dark-coloured, solitary bees (mostly halictids and hylaeine colletids) experiencing an extreme radiative heat load, enhanced by the high-altitude location and by reflection of incident radiation by the high-albedo petals of the-flowers of Potentilla lancinata, 3. When foraging in the flowers, such bees experienced peak operative temperatures exceeding 44 degrees C. In these conditions, males largely stopped foraging but females continued, usually limiting their flower visits to a few seconds and making frequent short -flights. These flights would cool the bees down, because bees suspended in air were cooler than bees in sunlit flowers, and convective cooling during flight would further enhance the cooling effect of departure from the flower. 4. As far as is known, cooling flights in small bees have not been proposed before, providing a new avenue for exploration of bee thermoreg,ulatory strategies.",2016

Little is known about the floral scent compounds of wild grapevine that is considered as being partly insect pollinated. The knowledge of volatiles released by male and female inflorescence may contribute to the understanding of the pollination biology of this endangered taxon. Inflorescence scents of male and female individuals were collected by dynamic headspace and analysed by thermal desorption-GC/MS. A total of 17 compounds of C5-branched chain alcohols, aliphatics, aromatics, and terpenoids were identified with benzyl alcohol being most abundant in both sexes. Eight of the compounds were sex specific and differences in 1,2-dimethoxybenzene were most obvious. This aromatic compound was a main constituent in the scent of females (30%), but it did not occur in males. Some of the main compounds of the scent samples are known to be detected by beetles (Cerambycidae) or attract sweat bees (Halictidae) and honey bees (A. mellifera), all well-known inflorescence visitors in wild grapevine. The data presented here are an important step in understanding the chemical communication between wild grapevine and its inflorescence visitors/potential pollinators.  ",2016
Effects of habitat disturbance on the pollination system of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus (Maxim) Cheng f. at the landscape-level in an arid region of Northwest China,Pollination; Pollen limitation; Pollinators; Seed set; Breeding system,POLLEN-LIMITATION; SEED SET; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; OVULE RATIOS; MANAGED POPULATIONS; PLANT REPRODUCTION; FLOWERING PLANTS; TEHUACAN VALLEY; CENTRAL MEXICO; FRAGMENTATION,"Ammopiptanthus mongolicus is an ecologically important species in the arid region of Northwest China. Habitat disturbance can significantly affect plant mating success and ultimately species viability. Pollen limitation of plant reproduction occurs in many plant species, particularly those under habitat disturbance. However, previous investigations have demonstrated differences in pollen limitation between conserved and disturbed sites. We compared the phenology, pollen limitation, pollinators and breeding system of both sites to determine whether habitat disturbance has generated changes in these plant components. We found that the species differed in four aspects. First, blooming duration and flowering peak were longer in the disturbed site than in the conserved site. Second, A. mongolicus can be pollen-limited and pollen limitation was more intense in the conserved site than in the disturbed site. Third, Anthophora uljanini was found to be a frequent pollinator in the conserved site, while Apis mellifera was the most effective and frequent flower visitor. More pollinator visits were recorded in the disturbed site, which could explain the differences in reproductive success. Finally, seed set was higher in the disturbed site than in the conserved site. We found that outcrossing was dominant in both sites and that agamospermy and self-pollination played complementary roles to ensure reproduction. Differences in flower production influenced by artificial selection and pollinator type explain the different seed set in both sites, whereas habitat disturbance cause changes differences in the pollination process and limits pollen flow. The balance between artificial management and mating success is crucial to analysis of the pollination process and manipulation of A. mongolicus population size.",2016
PLANT BIOTIC INTERACTIONS IN THE SONORAN DESERT: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES,arid lands; mutualism; antagonism; natural history; interspecific interactions; plant-plant interactions; symbiosis,SAGUARO CARNEGIEA-GIGANTEA; EXTRAFLORAL NECTAR RESOURCES; MESQUITE PROSOPIS-GLANDULOSA; RHIZOBIUM-LEGUME SYMBIOSIS; SEED DISPERSAL; ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA; ATRIPLEX-CANESCENS; FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; PROTECTION MUTUALISM,"Premise of research. Biotic interactions have long been considered to be of less importance in structuring desert systems than other ecosystem types, but biotic interactions often play a critical role in meeting the challenges posed by the extreme conditions of desert environments. The Sonoran Desert, in particular, is home to several textbook examples of mutualisms, such as the interactions between the iconic saguaro cactus and its bat pollinators. But what do we know about the diversity, ecology, and evolution of plant-animal, plant-plant, and plant-microbe interactions and their impacts on individual plants and plant species in the Sonoran Desert? Methodology. To address this question, we review the published research on seven common kinds of plant biotic interactions by revisiting the respective literature, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and outlining future research directions. Pivotal results. Numerous gaps in our knowledge of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert were identified. Studies of insect herbivory, bee pollination, and plant-microbe interactions are poorly represented in the Sonoran Desert literature. Across all categories of interaction, few have examined the impacts of interactions on plant fitness or context-dependent variation in the outcomes and strengths of interactions. For the most part, interactions have been studied at single locations and over short periods of time, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their diversity, ecology, and evolution. Conclusions. Plant biotic interactions shape the habitats in which they occur and play an important role in the maintenance of species diversity. Therefore, we call for increased efforts to fill the gaps in our understanding of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert, with an emphasis on studies linking interactions to plant fitness and the context-dependent nature of interactions. Without this knowledge we have limited capacity to predict the outcomes of global change on species interactions and to develop measures to conserve the biodiversity of the Sonoran Desert region.",2016
Reproductive biology of Cipocereus minensis (Cactaceae)-A columnar cactus endemic to rupestrian fields of a Neotropical savannah,Cactaceae; Endemic species; Chiropterophily; Self-incompatibility; Nocturnal and diurnal pollinators; Pollen limitation; Brazil,NECTAR-FEEDING BATS; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; POLLEN LIMITATION; TEHUACAN VALLEY; SONORAN DESERT; CENTRAL MEXICO; CACTACEAE; SPECIALIZATION; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS,"We studied the reproductive biology of Cipocereus minensis, an endemic columnar cactus of the Espinhago Mountain Range, Southeastern Brazil, focusing on floral biology, breeding system, and pollination. We described floral morphology and evaluated the role of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators on the reproductive success in two populations. C. minensis has large, horizontal, cream-colored, chiropterophilous flowers with rigid petals that open at dusk and close on the following morning. Flowers produced a huge amount of pollen grains and nectar production was nocturnal. Controlled pollination experiments revealed that the cactus is an obligate xenogamous species. Visitor-exclusion experiments revealed that the nocturnal visitors (bats) are the prominent pollinators whereas hummingbirds and social bees, which visited the flowers early in the morning, contributed little to fruit set. We conclude that the reproductive success of this endemic columnar cactus is threatened in the absence of the effective pollinating bats. ",2016

Diagnostic notes, illustrations and natural history observations are provided for species in the families Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Cleridae, Lycidae and Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera), Muscidae, Platystomatidae and Tabanidae (Diptera), Apidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Sphecidae and Vespidae (Hymenoptera), and Pieridae and Thyrididae (Lepidoptera) that transported pollen of tree or shrub species. Observations on floral phenology and pollination syndrome are presented for 27 flowering tree or shrub species. To provide a foundation for studies of the effects of drought and climate change on pollination services in the Kruger National Park, we applied methods of food web analysis to characterise this plant-pollinator assemblage. The food web analysis shows moderate levels of redundancy in plant-pollinator interactions (with connectance values averaging 0.19 for plant species and 0.20 for pollinator species), suggesting that pollination services in this system may exhibit some resilience to environmental perturbations. Possible conservation strategies for maintaining pollination services in this ecological system are discussed, including habitat management to conserve larval or nesting areas for social and solitary bees and scarab beetles, as well as further inventories and long-term monitoring of pollinator species.",2016
"Attract them anyway: benefits of large, showy flowers in a highly autogamous, carnivorous plant species",Autogamous selfing; Drosophyllum lusitanicum; floral display; pollination biology; prey capture; pyrophyte; seed set,DROSOPHYLLUM-LUSITANICUM DROSERACEAE; POLLINATOR-PREY CONFLICT; SELF-FERTILIZATION; MEDITERRANEAN HEATHLANDS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; POPULATION VIABILITY; INSECTIVOROUS PLANT; WONDERFUL PLANTS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,"Reproductive biology of carnivorous plants has largely been studied on species that rely on insects as pollinators and prey, creating potential conflicts. Autogamous pollination, although present in some carnivorous species, has received less attention. In angiosperms, autogamous self-fertilization is expected to lead to a reduction in flower size, thereby reducing resource allocation to structures that attract pollinators. A notable exception is the carnivorous pyrophyte Drosophyllum lusitanicum(Drosophyllaceae), which has been described as an autogamous selfing species but produces large, yellow flowers. Using a flower removal and a pollination experiment, we assessed, respectively, whether large flowers in this species may serve as an attracting device to prey insects or whether previously reported high selfing rates for this species in peripheral populations may be lower in more central, less isolated populations. We found no differences between flower-removed plants and intact, flowering plants in numbers of prey insects trapped. We also found no indication of reduced potential for autogamous reproduction, in terms of either seed set or seed size. However, our results showed significant increases in seed set of bagged, hand-pollinated flowers and unbagged flowers exposed to insect visitation compared with bagged, non-manipulated flowers that could only self-pollinate autonomously. Considering that the key life-history strategy of this pyrophytic species is to maintain a viable seed bank, any increase in seed set through insect pollinator activity would increase plant fitness. This in turn would explain the maintenance of large, conspicuous flowers in a highly autogamous, carnivorous plant.",2016
The Effect of Altered Soil Moisture on Hybridization Rate in a Crop-Wild System (Raphanus spp.),,CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEED EVOLUTION; FLORAL DISPLAY; FLOWERING TIME; GENE FLOW; RADISH; POPULATIONS; INTROGRESSION; RAPHANISTRUM; PATTERNS,"Since plant mating choices are flexible and responsive to the environment, rates of spontaneous hybridization may vary across ecological clines. Developing a robust and predictive framework for rates of plant gene flow requires assessing the role of environmental sensitivity on plant reproductive traits, relative abundance, and pollen vectors. Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we quantified pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to wild (Raphanus raphanistrum) radish populations. Both radish species were grown together in relatively dry (no rain), relatively wet (double rain), or control soil moisture conditions in Ohio, USA. We measured wild and crop radish life-history, phenology and pollinator visitation patterns. To quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species, we used a simply inherited morphological marker to detect F-1 hybrid progeny. Although crop-to-wild hybridization did not respond to watering treatments, the abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the period of phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal numbers of open flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and its relationship to flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid zone formation in Raphanus spp. than soil moisture or pollen vector movements.",2016
Feedback effects between plant and flower-visiting insect communities along a primary succession gradient,Community assembly; Functional traits; Glacier forelands; Plant-insect interactions; Reproductive output,ALPINE GLACIER-FORELAND; INVERTEBRATE SUCCESSION; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SOIL DEVELOPMENT; ITALIAN ALPS; CHRONOSEQUENCE; VISITATION; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY,"Primary successions of glacier forelands are unique model systems to investigate community dynamics and assembly processes. However, successional changes of plant and insect communities have been mainly analysed separately. Therefore, changes in plant-insect interactions along successional gradients on glacier forelands remain unknown, despite their relevance to ecosystem functioning. This study assessed how successional changes of the vegetation influenced the composition of the flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding, insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive output through top-down control. We emphasise that dynamics of alpine plant and insect communities may be structured by biotic interactions and feedback processes, rather than only be influenced by harsh abiotic conditions and stochastic events.",2016
The dilemma of being a fragrant flower: the major floral volatile attracts pollinators and florivores in the euglossine-pollinated orchid Dichaea pendula,Atlantic Forest; Euglossini; Floral headspace; Chemical ecology; Pollination,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; RAIN-FOREST; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; BEES; DIVERSIFICATION; CONSEQUENCES; SCENT; IDENTIFICATION; LIMITATION,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate both mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions; thus, the attraction of mutualists and antagonists by floral VOCs constitutes an important trade-off in the evolutionary ecology of angiosperms. Here, we evaluate the role of VOCs in mediating communication between the plant and its mutualist and antagonist floral visitors. To assess the evolutionary consequences of VOC-mediated signalling to distinct floral visitors, we studied the reproductive ecology of Dichaea pendula, assessing the effects of florivores on fruit set, the pollination efficiency of pollinators and florivores, the floral scent composition and the attractiveness of the major VOC to pollinators and florivores. The orchid depends entirely on orchid-bees for sexual reproduction, and the major florivores, the weevils, feed on corollas causing self-pollination, triggering abortion of 26.4 % of the flowers. Floral scent was composed of approximately 99 % 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, an unusual floral VOC attractive to pollinators and florivores. The low fruit set from natural pollination (5.6 %) compared to hand cross-pollination (45.5 %) and low level of pollinator visitation [0.02 visits (flower hour)(-1)] represent the limitations to pollination. Our research found that 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol mediates both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, which could result in contrary evolutionary pressures on novo-emission. The scarcity of pollinators, not florivory, was the major constraint to fruit set. Our results suggest that, rather than anti-florivory adaptations, adaptations to enhance pollinator attraction and cross-pollination might be the primary drivers of the evolution of VOC emission in euglossine-pollinated flowers.",2016
Of feathers and fur: Differential pollinator roles of birds and small mammals in the grassland succulent Aloe peglerae,Aloe peglerae; bird pollination; Cape rock-thrush; Elephantulus; mammal pollination; Micaelamys,RODENT POLLINATION; NONFLYING MAMMALS; AVIAN NECTARIVORES; FLORAL VISITORS; DILUTE NECTAR; SOUTH-AFRICAN; PLANT; PROTEACEAE; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS,"The pollination syndrome of the genus Aloe, with gaudy inflorescences and orange-red flowers, suggests bird pollination. However, the diversity of flowering phenologies and structures suggests that generalizations within the group are currently uninformative because few studies have addressed the role of multiple pollinator guilds, especially mammals. Aloe peglerae, endemic to montane grassland of the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa, is primarily bird pollinated, although small mammals are recorded nocturnal visitors. We compared the independent contributions of diurnal and nocturnal visitors, i.e. birds and small mammals respectively, to reproductive success by assigning 12 flowering A. peglerae plants to each of four pollinator selective exclusion treatments: (i) no-visitors; (ii) nocturnal-visitors; (iii) diurnal-visitors; and (iv) all-visitors (control). Birds alone contributed more to fruit set (1.2-2.6 times), average seed/fruit (1.0-1.8 times) and total seed production (1.1-2.8 times) than both the all visitors (birds and small mammals combined) and the small mammal visitors respectively. The exclusion of all visitors resulted in no fruit set, suggesting that A. peglerae requires pollinators to set seed. Germination trials over six weeks and viability testing with tetrazolium staining identified no significant differences among the three treatments that produced fruit and seed. Germination success was 90-97%, indicating that seed quality of small-mammal and bird-pollinated plants are similar. Aloe peglerae inflorescences were visited continuously throughout the day and night, with the Cape rock-thrush (Monticola rupestris) and dark-capped bulbul (Pycnonotus tricolor) being the most abundant pollinators, accounting for 68.2% and 13.7% of all visits respectively in the control treatment. Small mammals, i.e. Namaqua rock mouse (Micaelamys namaquensis) and eastern rock sengi (Elephantulus myurus), while not increasing reproductive success in the absence of birds, are suitable alternative pollinators. The presence of diurnal bird and nocturnal small mammal visitors provides a diversity of pollinators in this resilient pollination syndrome.",2016
Plastic Responses Contribute to Explaining Altitudinal and Temporal Variation in Potential Flower Longevity in High Andean Rhodolirion montanum,,CAMPANULA-ROTUNDIFOLIA CAMPANULACEAE; CENTRAL CHILEAN ANDES; FLORAL LONGEVITY; POLLEN LIMITATION; POLLINATOR VISITATION; MT-OLYMPOS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS; SIZE VARIATION,"The tendency for flower longevity to increase with altitude is believed by many alpine ecologists to play an important role in compensating for low pollination rates at high altitudes due to cold and variable weather conditions. However, current studies documenting an altitudinal increase in flower longevity in the alpine habitat derive principally from studies on open pollinated flowers where lower pollinator visitation rates at higher altitudes will tend to lead to flower senescence later in the life-span of a flower in comparison with lower altitudes, and thus could confound the real altitudinal pattern in a species' potential flower longevity. In a two-year study we tested the hypothesis that a plastic effect of temperature on flower longevity could contribute to an altitudinal increase in potential flower longevity measured in pollinator-excluded flowers in high Andean Rhodolirium montanum Phil. (Amaryllidaceae). Using supplemental warming we investigated whether temperature around flowers plastically affects potential flower longevity. We determined tightly temperature-controlled potential flower longevity and flower height for natural populations on three alpine sites spread over an altitudinal transect from 2350 and 3075 m a.s.l. An experimental increase of 3.1 degrees C around flowers significantly decreased flower longevity indicating a plastic response of flowers to temperature. Flower height in natural populations decreased significantly with altitude. Although temperature negatively affects flower longevity under experimental conditions, we found no evidence that temperature around flowers explains site variation in flower longevity over the altitudinal gradient. In a wetter year, despite a 3.5 degrees C temperature difference around flowers at the extremes of the altitudinal range, flower longevity showed no increase with altitude. However, in a drier year, flower longevity increased significantly with altitude. The emerging picture suggests an increase in flower longevity along the altitudinal gradient is less common for potential flower longevity than for open-pollination flower longevity. Independently of any selection that may occur on potential longevity, plastic responses of flowers to environmental conditions are likely to contribute to altitudinal variation in flower longevity, especially in dry alpine areas. Such plastic responses could push flowers of alpine species towards shorter life-lengths under climate change, with uncertain consequences for successful pollination and plant fitness in a warming world.",2016

During that time, many field methods have been developed to clarify the pollination effectiveness of each pollinator for visited flowers. Pollinator observations have been one of the most common methods to identify pollinators, and bagging and cage experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of specific pollinators. In a previous study of Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea, its effective pollinators, the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor, and its reproductive strategies were not identified. This study reports the observation that small bees visited flowers that were partially opened ( breaking buds). To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported previously. Further, this study investigates the hypothesis that small bees can pollinate at that flowering stage. This study demonstrates the basic methods of field experiments in pollination ecology using L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. Pollinator observations and digital video showed the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor. Bagging and cage experiments revealed that these flowers could be pollinated fully and that breaking-bud pollination could be important for the pollination of this plant species. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed, and recent developments, including laboratory experiments, are described.",2016
The Role of Honey Bees as Pollinators in Natural Areas,Apis mellifera; competition; mutualistic networks; native bees; pollination,CASHEW ANACARDIUM-OCCIDENTALE; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE BEES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; INTRODUCED HONEYBEES; FLORAL RESOURCES; CENTAUREA-SOLSTITIALIS; NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE,"The western or European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the primary managed pollinator in US agricultural systems, and its importance for food production is widely recognized. However, the role of A. mellifera as an introduced species in natural areas is potentially more complicated. The impact of A. mellifera on native insect pollinators can depend on broad community context, as can the relative effectiveness of A. mellifera in pollination of both native and nonnative plant species outside of agricultural systems. Apis mellifera is highly generalist and able to interact with hundreds of native plant species following its naturalization. It is unlikely to wholly replace native pollinators as visitors of specialized plant species, and its behavioral characteristics tend to reduce A. mellifera's per-visit efficiency, even when its overall effectiveness is high. Preliminary results of our case study exploring the importance of A. mellifera vs. native bees as pollinators of native plants in Hawai'i indicate that A. mellifera is less important than native Hylaeus bees as a flower visitor of focal native plant species. In light of current global declines in A. mellifera populations, maintenance of a diversity of pollinators and pollinator habitat are critical conservation needs in natural areas.",2016
Alien Insects Dominate the Plant-Pollinator Network of a Hawaiian Coastal Ecosystem,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FLOWER-VISITATION NETWORKS; NATIVE PLANT; FLORAL VISITATION; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS; SEED DISPERSAL; ARGENTINE ANT; PATTERNS; ISLANDS,"Little is known regarding pollination webs involving island coastal plants and pollinators, and roles that nonnative flower visitors may play in these interaction networks. Plant-pollinator observations made in March 2008 and 2009 were used to describe the pollination network for Ka'ena Point, one of Hawai'i's best-conserved coastal communities. The network includes 15 native plant species, two native bee species, and 26 nonnative insect taxa, forming 119 interactions. Network connectance is 29.4% and weighted nestedness is 17.9, which are similar to values of other dry-habitat, island networks. The network's structure has a core of generalized pollinators plus several more-specialized pollinators. Nearly all plant species interact with two or more generalist pollinators and a variable number of specialists. Small, nonnative bees (Lasioglossum, Ceratina), wasps (Proconura), and flies (mostly Tachinidae) were responsible for 72.7% of flower visits, and they visit five plant species not visited by native bees. The two native visitors were the bees Hylaeus anthracinus and H. longiceps (both proposed as endangered). Hylaeus spp. (especially females) provided 19.8% of flower visits, foraging at high visitation rates and on many species, including the endangered Scaevola coriacea and Sesbania tomentosa. In Hawai'i's coastal habitat, nonnative insects form novel interactions with native species and may maintain an ecosystem's function following loss of most of the original native pollinators. However, their high visitation rates suggest that the two remaining native Hylaeus species are potentially important pollinators for many of the native plants on which they rely for nectar and pollen resources.",2016

This research was performed in an arid climatic zone of the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia). To determine if there is partitioning of pollinators between the two species their peak flowering periods were monitored and the peak time of pollen release through the day was quantified as the ratio of polyads to anthers. The nectar sugar secretion dynamics were estimated following nectar sugar washing techniques. The types and frequency of visitors were recorded and correlated. The two species varied in their peak flowering time within a season and peak pollen release time within a day. Moreover, both species secreted significant amounts of nectar sugar. The sharing of pollinators and the partial monopoly of certain visitors were observed. The two sympatric acacia species are structured into a partial temporal separation of their peak flowering and pollen release times, which appears to be an adaptation to minimize pollinator competition.",2016

We recorded 190 butterfly species feeding on 149 flowering plant species across forests and urban parks in Singapore. Butterflies were classified as flower generalists, intermediates or specialists by fitting a power function between the number of flower species utilized and the flower visits observed for that butterfly species. Generalized least squares models were constructed between the degree of flower specialization and traits of butterfly species. Our analysis showed that more species were flower generalists than flower specialists in both habitat types. Forty-three percent of feeding observations in forested sites were on non-native flowers. Yet, flower specialists used significantly higher proportions of native flower species in their diet than flower generalists and tended to be forest dependent. Some forest butterflies were critically dependent (>70%) on single native flower species. Out of 19 butterfly species examined for response across habitats, five expanded their diet but six contracted their diet with urbanization. The regression models revealed that adult conspicuousness, habitat breadth, proboscis length, and wingspan were most strongly associated with flower specialization when accounting for phylogenetic relatedness. Our results suggest that while landscape transformation in the tropics could benefit some flower-generalist butterflies by providing extra resources, flower-specialist butterflies could further increase dependence on few native flower sources. Such butterflies may require intervention in terms of landscape management of their preferred flower resources.  ",2016
Nectar alkaloids of tree tobacco can reduce Palestine sunbird foraging performance in a colour discrimination task,anabasine; behaviour; bird; cognition; colour; foraging; memory; nicotine; pollinator; secondary metabolites,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; NICOTIANA-GLAUCA; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; SECONDARY METABOLITES; FLORAL REWARDS; PLANT DEFENSE; NATIVE PLANT; TOXIC NECTAR; APIS-CERANA; ANABASINE,"Many plant species contain plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), such as alkaloids, in their tissues for protection against herbivore attack, but PSMs can also be found in floral nectar. Some pollinators have been shown to discriminate against floral nectar with PSMs and consuming PSMs may have negative fitness effects on pollinators. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of ecologically relevant levels of PSMs on pollinator foraging performance. Here, we addressed the question of whether the natural concentrations of the alkaloids, nicotine and anabasine, found in tree tobacco, Nicotiana glauca, nectar affect foraging performance in Palestine sunbird, Nectarinia osea, pollinators that use the plant's nectar as a food source. We trained foraging sunbirds to discriminate between rewarding and nonrewarding artificial flowers based on colour. We measured sunbird foraging performance through their accuracy at distinguishing the two colours immediately after training (pretreatment), and again the following day after consuming sucrose solutions with or without alkaloids (post-treatment). We also explored other potential effects of PSM consumption by assessing bird activity level and flower visit rate. Birds that consumed alkaloids did not significantly change their activity level or flower visit rate across time (pre- and post-treatment) compared to birds that did not consume alkaloids (no significant time by treatment interaction). However, alkaloid consumption significantly decreased sunbird foraging performance in terms of their accuracy in distinguishing the rewarding colour, potentially due to reduced memory retention and/or other cognitive or physiological impairments following alkaloid consumption. We also found that sunbirds discriminated against higher, in favour of lower, ecologically relevant alkaloid concentrations in the nectar of tree tobacco and that previous exposure to alkaloids reduced overall consumption of alkaloid solutions. Reduced foraging performance due to PSM ingestion could greatly affect a pollinator's foraging efficiency, which could, in turn, affect both pollinator and plant reproductive fitness.",2016
Ecology and Conservation of the Endangered Legume Crotalaria avonensis in Florida Scrub,,LAKE WALES RIDGE; FIRE MANAGEMENT; GAP ECOLOGY; PLANTS; MICROHABITAT; DEMOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; CONTINUUM; RESPONSES; TIME,"We collected data from 1998 to 2014 to describe the ecology of the highly endangered Florida scrub plant Crotalaria avonensis (Avon Park Harebells), and herein address several hypotheses based on what was known of its biology and the biology of co-occurring species. This perennial herbaceous legume occurs at 3 sites and prefers microsites with more cover by bare sand than vegetation. The population at an unprotected site has declined in size, but dynamics have been more stable at the 2 protected sites. Marked plants have shown high survival, slow and inconsistent growth, and occasional plant dormancy (usually 1-2 years). Avon Park Harebells is reproductively challenged, with very low rates of fruit set and infrequent visitation by required pollinators. The hardseeded fruits germinated at a rate of 13-56%; the germination speed seemed to increase after scarification, though the overall rate was less than for unscarified seeds. Unscarified seeds remained viable in the seed bank for at least 3 years. Seedlings recruited rarely, had moderate survival, began flowering at 4 years of age or later, and reached the size of median adult plants in 6-8 years. Herbivores affected 7-53% of plants in a given year, but plants showed rapid compensatory resprouting. Caging plants reduced herbivory and increased survival, growth, and flowering. Plants resprouted after fire and mechanical disturbance and exhibited high survival and growth, but repeated disturbances by vehicles caused increased mortality. Avon Park Harebells remains extremely endangered due to its limited range, small population sizes, and poor seedling recruitment. To help this species recover, we recommend fire management, protection from herbivory, introductions and augmentations, and further study of its pollination biology.",2016
Pollination of a native plant changes with distance and density of invasive plants in a simulated biological invasion,Boraginaceae; Brassica nigra; Brassicaceae; density; heterospecific pollen; invasion ecology; Phacelia parryi; pollinator visitation; reproductive ecology; seed production,POLLEN DEPOSITION; ALIEN PLANT; SEED-SET; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; INSECT VISITATION; BRASSICA-NIGRA; EXOTIC PLANT; COMPETITION; COMMUNITY; SELECTION,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Effects of an exotic plant on pollination may change as the invasive increases in density. Quantity of pollinator visits to a native may increase, decrease, or change nonlinearly, while visit quality is likely to decrease with greater interspecific pollen movement. How visit quantity and quality contribute to the effect on reproductive success at each invasion stage has not been measured. METHODS: We simulated four stages of invasion by Brassica nigra by manipulating the neighborhood of potted plants of the native Phacelia parryi in a field experiment. Stages were far from the invasion, near the invasion, intermixed with the invasive at low density, and intermixed at high density. We measured pollinator visitation, conspecific and invasive pollen deposition, and seed set for P. parryi at each stage. KEY RESULTS: Native individuals near invasive plants and within areas of low invasive density showed greatest seed production, as expected from concurrent changes in conspecific and invasive pollen deposition. Those plants experienced facilitation of visits and received more conspecific pollen relative to plants farther from invasives. Native individuals within high invasive density also received frequent visits by many pollinators (although not honeybees), but the larger receipt of invasive pollen predicted interference with pollen tubes that matched patterns in seed set. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator visitation was highest when exotic plants were nearby. Detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen deposition were highest at high exotic density. Our study quantified how reproduction benefits from near proximity to a showy invasive, but is still vulnerable when the invasive reaches high density.",2016

In the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest, the daily frequency of male flower anthesis peaked between 1000-1200 h (GMT -3) and was positively correlated with rising temperature, wind currents, and direct insolation, but negatively correlated with relative humidity. A generalized linear mixed model predicts the probability of pollen release under different conditions of relative humidity and wind. Receptive stigmas on female flowers were found at any time of day: individual stigmas were receptive (H2O2 test) for at least two days. Beetles and halictid bees were observed feeding on pollen from staminate flowers, but probably did not affect pollination because they did not seem to visit pistillate flowers. Individual plants of this apparently ruderal species grow along road edges and show aggregated (clumped) spatial dispersion. The overall sex ratio we found was 29 females to 43 males, with one monoecious plant in a total transect distance of 6319 m. Pollen traps were placed on the female plants to measure pollen arrival. Pollen capture was higher on the more exposed road-facing side and positively related to male plant density.",2016

Hummingbirds (Aves: Trochilidae) are nectarivorous birds that usually coexist in sympatry, and visit flowers using different foraging behaviors and levels of aggressiveness as a strategy to diminish resource competition. Here, we describe the dynamics in territorial and dominance behaviors in a hummingbird community inhabiting a highland during winter in Western Mexico. We explored in natural conditions how foraging strategies and dominance status of the hummingbirds was influenced by community species composition, sex, age and size of the individuals, floral abundance, and nectar resource availability. The community studied was composed of 11 species (four residents, three altitudinal migrants, three latitudinal migrants), and all possible combinations of dominance and territoriality were found. Differences in the dominance status and foraging behavior were related to the species, sex, age and body size of the individuals, as well as the number of flowers in the patches, and the abundance of the migratory species over time. The aggressive and territorial species preferred the places with more flowers, and started the majority of the interactions attacking even birds that did not visited the flowers. The subordinate non-territorial hummingbirds visited floral patches of different sizes, did not start aggressive interactions and when they were involved in one, this occurred during their visits to the territorial hummingbird's flowers. Hummingbird dominance changed during the winter and at the end of the season, when the latitudinal migrant species left our study site, the resident species were more abundant, dominant and territorial. Dominance status and foraging behavior, together with floral preferences and the spatial distribution of nectar resources, acted as mechanisms organizing this hummingbird community.",2016
Pollinator-mediated impacts of alien invasive plants on the pollination of native plants: the role of spatial scale and distinct behaviour among pollinator guilds,Exotic species invasion; Facilitation; Magnet plant effect; Plant reproductive success; Plant-pollinator interactions; Competition for pollinators,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; OTHERS POLLINATION; CARPOBROTUS SPP.; MIMULUS-RINGENS; POLLEN TRANSFER; COMPETITION; VISITATION; DIVERSITY; LIMITATION; MECHANISM,"Alien invasive plant species can affect pollination, reproductive success and population dynamics of co-flowering native species via shared pollinators. Consequences may range from reproductive competition to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1) invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly, we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast, showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 %), but higher in the pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 % (reproductive facilitation) in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 % (reproductive competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations. Our study highlights the crucial role of spatial scale and pollinator guild driving indirect effects of invasive on co-flowering native plant species.",2016
Pollination of Aosa rupestris (Hook.) Weigend (Loasaceae): are stamen movements induced by pollinators?,Caatinga; Colletidae; Melittophily; Oligolecty; Protandry,OLIGOLECTIC POLLINATORS; SUBFAM. LOASOIDEAE; FLOWERS; PLANT; BEES; CACTACEAE; RESPONSES; CORNALES; REVOLVER; BRAZIL,"Inducement to stamen movement by oligolectic bees has been reported for some Loasaceae species; however, detailed research studies on the pollination ecology of species in the genus Aosa are absent. In this study, we analyzed the floral biology and breeding system of Aosa rupestris (Hook.) Weigend, focusing on the role of pollinators in inducing stamens' movements. We described the anthesis, the behavior of floral visitors, and carried out reproductive experiments in a population in a dry forest (""caatinga'') area in Northeastern Brazil. Wecarried out four experiments and one control to establish whether the interval between the movements of two successive stamens is regulated by pollinator visits. Anthesis lasted for 3-4 days. Stamens (102 +/- 12.57) remained with closed anther inside petals early in the anthesis, after which they moved to the center of the flower and presented its pollen (male phase). After all stamens have reached the center of the flower, the female phase started. Bicolletes nordestina Urban, 2006 was the only floral visitor to A. rupestris flowers, drinking nectar, collecting pollen, or sleeping on the flowers. Aosa rupestris was autogamous, but fruit set was higher under natural conditions. The interval between movements of two successive stamens was not different among experiments. Therefore, stamen movements were spontaneous and did not respond to pollinator visits, in contrast to the pattern of stamen movements observed in other Loasaceae species. Although A. rupestris is autogamous, floral structure and behavior of the oligolectic bee pollinator ensured the highest level of fruit set in this species.",2016
Effect of Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on flower-visiting behavior of insects on Brassica napus (Brassicales: Brassicaceae),biological invasion; species abundance; GC-EAD,LINEPITHEMA-HUMILE MAYR; IMPORTED FIRE ANTS; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; JATROPHA-CURCAS; EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; L.

(Brassicales: Brassicaceae). Chemicals from fire ants were identified, and their electrophysiological effects on the cabbage white butterfly Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) were analyzed by gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) bioassays. The results showed that S. invicta significantly reduced the abundance of pollinators. The number of striped flea beetles (Phyllotreta striolata [F.]; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and hover flies (Eristalinus quinquestriatus [F.] and E. quinquelineatus [F.]; Diptera: Syrphidae) in fire ant-included and fire-ant-and-aphid-included plots was 43.5 and 39.4% lower, respectively, than in control plots. The visiting duration at a single flower for P. rapae in the plots that had fire ants and aphids excluded was significantly longer than in the fire ant-included (1.42 fold) and fire-ant-and-aphid-included plots (1.29 fold). However, the visiting frequency of P. rapae and of the Chinese honey bee Apis cerana F. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the duration of each visit of A. cerana were not significantly changed. Antennae of P. rapae showed obvious electrophysiological reactions to the volatiles of S. invicta, and n-heptacosane elicited the largest EAD response. Our results suggest a negative effect and its chemical mechanism of S. invicta on the behavior of several flower-visiting insects.",2016
Pollination of lark daisy on roadsides declines as traffic speed increases along an Amazonian highway,Centratherum punctatum; conservation; pollination success; traffic disturbance; turbulence impact,CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; BEES,"Ecological disturbances caused by roadways have previously been reported, but traffic speed has not been addressed. We investigate effects of traffic speed on pollination of Centratherum punctatum (Asteraceae) along an Amazonian highway roadside. We hypothesised that frequency of flower visitors, duration of single visits and pollen deposition on stigmas will vary negatively as traffic speed increases. After measuring vehicle velocities, we classified three road sections as low-, mid- and high-velocity traffic. The main pollinator bee, Augochlora sp., visited C.punctatum inflorescences with decreasing frequency from low- to high-velocity roadside sections, whereas the nectar thief butterflies did the opposite. Duration of single visits by bees and butterflies was shorter, and arrival of pollen on C.punctatum stigmas was lower, in high- than in low-velocity roadside. Air turbulence due to passing vehicles increases with velocity and disturbed the flower visitors. Overall, results support that traffic velocity negatively affects foraging of flower visitors and the pollination of C.punctatum on roadsides.",2016
Plant-pollinator interactions in a biodiverse meadow are rather stable and tight for 3 consecutive years,interaction strength; plant-pollinator interaction; quantitative network; temporal variation; turnover,INTERACTION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SPECIALIZATION; ASSEMBLAGE; SELECTION; ISLANDS; SYSTEMS; DESERT,"Plant-pollinator interactions can be highly variable across years in natural communities. Although variation in the species composition and its basic structure has been investigated to understand the dynamic nature of pollination networks, little is known about the temporal dynamic of interaction strength between the same plant and pollinator species in any natural community. Pollinator-mediated selection on the evolution of floral traits could be diminished if plant-pollinator interactions vary temporally. To quantify the temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions and the interaction strength (observed visits), we compared weighted networks between plants and pollinators in a biodiverse alpine meadow in Shangri-La, southwest China for 3 consecutive years. Although plant-pollinator interactions were highly dynamic such that identical interactions only accounted for 10.7% of the total between pair years, the diversity of interactions was stable. These identical interactions contributed 41.2% of total visits and were similar in strength and weighted nestedness. For plant species, 72.6% of species were visited by identical pollinator species between pair years, accounting for over half of the total visits and three-quarters at the functional group level. More generalized pollinators contributed more connectiveness and were more central in networks across years. However, there was no similar or even opposite trend for plant species, which suggested that specialized plant species may also be central in pollinator networks. The variation in pollinator composition decreased as pollinator species numbers increased, suggesting that generalized plants experienced stable pollinator partition. The stable, tight interactions between generalized pollinators and specialized plants represent cornerstones of the studied community.",2016

The flowering phenology of E. chionantha can be divided into five phases. We found significant differences in the pollination efficiency of the different insects visiting E. chionantha with bees and flies being the most efficient pollinators. This, in addition to floral morphology and phenology, suggests that E. chionantha is generalized on bees and flies and possesses an outcrossing, partially self-compatible and pollinator-dependent breeding system.",2016
Getting the smell of it - odour cues structure pollinator networks,,MUSHROOM BODY; GENERALIST,"In Focus: Larue, A.-A.C., Raguso, R.A. & Junker, R.R. (2015) Experimental manipulation of floral scent bouquets restructures flower-visitor interactions in the field. Journal of Animal Ecology, 85, 396-408. Pollinators use multiple cues to locate suitable flowers, and recent studies argue that flower volatiles are more important than previously believed. However, the role of volatiles is seldom separated from other cues. Larue, Raguso & Junker (2015) manipulated the volatile profile of two plants that are normally visited by different pollinators. Achillea millefolium is normally not visited by honeybees and bumblebees, but these pollinator groups did visit plants that were sprayed with volatiles from Cirsium arvense. Cirsium arvense, on the other hand, was less visited by honeybees and bumblebees when sprayed with volatiles from A.millefolium. These findings highlight the potential role of volatiles in structuring pollinator communities on plants.",2016

Dung beetles, known as dung-visiting insects, play several key roles in many ecological functions from which benefit both terrestrial ecosystems and human population. Specifically, they benefit rangelands through reducing greenhouse gas emission, nutrient cycling, plant growth enhancement, trophic regulation and pollination and secondary seed dispersal. This study examined secondary seed dispersal as one of the ecological functions of dung beetles, in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran. We applied an experimental approach to measure ecological function (i.e. seed removal) by functional groups of dung beetles. We tested whether functional dung beetle groups influence secondary seed dispersal differently. Through repeated standardized samples of sheep dung, data obtained regularly during two different months August and November in 2013. The results show that dung beetles play a role in secondary seed dispersal. However, it is affected by seed size, so that seed removal increased in the order of, large, medium and small size, respectively. The significant differences between treatments were found for small seeds in the both months. More seeds were dispersed from treatment t02 (all combinations of functional groups except large rollers) in August, while in November more seeds from treatments t01 (dwellers plus large and small tunnelers plus large and small rollers) and t03 (the combinations of dwellers plus small tunnelers, and small rollers) were removed. As a conclusion, it is suggested that if it is to guarantee the ecological sustainability of rangelands, paying attention to the ecological functions of dung beetles is crucial.",2016

We investigated altitudinal variations in five flower dimensions of two native Japanese Impatiens species (I. textori and I. noli-tangere) and their interactions with their faunal visitors. These two species have similar floral traits, including flower shape, flowering time, and pollinator species; both species are pollinated mainly by Bombus diversus. In I. textori, all measured flower dimensions were negatively correlated with altitude. In contrast, in I. noli-tangere, no measured flower dimensions correlated with altitude. Thus, the altitudinal pattern of flower size variation differed between these congeneric co-habiting herbaceous plant species. The different patterns suggest that the factors (e.g. altitudinal variations of abiotic factors) that cause variation of flower size differ between these two Impatiens species even though focal species have similar floral traits (e.g. flower shape, flowering time, and pollinator species).",2016

Floral visitors use floral scent to estimate the amount of reward present in flowers, to facilitate the identification of a specific host flower or as signals that chemically resemble those important for pollinator insects in other ecological contexts. There is good evidence that floral scent evolves under selection imposed by both mutualists and antagonists. Antagonists may often limit the amount of scent emitted by flowers, thus contributing to spatial population variation, and select for phenotypic plasticity after enemy attack. Floral scent is also an important component of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation, as it often co-varies with color and morphology in sister species with different pollination systems.",2015
"Species traits and abundances predict metrics of plant-pollinator network structure, but not pairwise interactions",,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; NESTEDNESS; PATTERNS; WEB; EXPLOITATION; CONNECTANCE; FLOWERS; SYSTEMS,"Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some pollinators). Plant-pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species assemblages. The most successful hypotheses to explain these network properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses, which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly documented temporally explicit alpine plant-pollinator visitation network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies. However, all models were poor predictors of species pairwise interaction frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant-pollinator visitation network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise interactions rather than network metrics, and better reflect the biology underlying species interactions.",2015

Although floral scent is thought to mediate pollinator behavior, little is known about its effects on pollinator attraction and floral visitation in the wild. We used field experiments with wild hawkmoths and laboratory experiments with naive hawkmoths to investigate attraction to and probing of flowers in response to indole, a volatile emitted by Ipomopsis tenuituba but not its close relative I. aggregata, both alone and in combination with floral color differences. We demonstrated that indole attracts wild hawkmoths to flowers, but has little effect on the rate at which those attracted moths probe flowers. In contrast, white flower color did not influence hawkmoth attraction in the field, but caused more attracted moths to probe flowers. Thus, the moths require both scent and high visual contrast, in that order, to feed at flowers at dusk. Their preference for indole-scented flowers is innate, but species-specific preference is mitigated by previous experience and plant spatial patterning. This context-dependent behavior helps explain why these Ipomopsis species show geographical variation in the extent of hybridization and may potentially explain formation of hybrid bridges in other systems of hawkmoth-pollinated plants.",2015
Constructing more informative plant-pollinator networks: visitation and pollen deposition networks in a heathland plant community,pollination; network; species interaction; pollinator effectiveness; pollinator importance; specialization,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; STABILITY; VISITORS; ECOLOGY; WEB; SPECIALIZATION; HETEROGENEITY; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; FREQUENCY,"Interaction networks are widely used as tools to understand plant pollinator communities, and to examine potential threats to plant diversity and food security if the ecosystem service provided by pollinating animals declines. However, most networks to date are based on recording visits to flowers, rather than recording dearly defined effective pollination events. Here we provide the first networks that explicitly incorporate measures of pollinator effectiveness (PE) from pollen deposition on stigmas per visit, and pollinator importance (PI) as the product of PE and visit frequency. These more informative networks, here produced for a low diversity heathland habitat, reveal that plant pollinator interactions are more specialized than shown in most previous studies. At the studied site, the spedalization index H-2' was lower for the visitation network than the PE network, which was in turn lower than H-2' for the PI network Our study shows that collecting PE data is feasible for community-level studies in low diversity communities and that including information about PE can change the structure of interaction networks. This could have important consequences for our understanding of threats to pollination systems.",2015

We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a tropical plant species has the capacity to discriminate among floral visitors, investing in reproduction differentially across the pollinator community. After we standardized pollen quality in 223 aviary experiments, successful pollination of Heliconia tortuosa (measured as pollen tube abundance) occurred frequently when plants were visited by long-distance traplining hummingbird species with specialized bills ((x) over bar pollen tubes = 1.21 +/- 0.12 SE) but was reduced 5.7 times when visited by straight-billed territorial birds (x pollen tubes = 0.20 +/- 0.074 SE) or insects. Our subsequent experiments revealed that plants use the nectar extraction capacity of tropical hummingbirds, a positive function of bill length, as a cue to turn on reproductively. Furthermore, we show that hummingbirds with long bills and high nectar extraction efficiency engaged in daily movements at broad spatial scales (similar to 1 km), but that territorial species moved only short distances (< 100 m). Such pollinator recognition may therefore affect mate selection and maximize receipt of high-quality pollen from multiple parents. Although a diffuse pollinator network is implied, because all six species of hummingbirds carry pollen of H. tortuosa, only two species with specialized bills contribute meaningfully to its reproduction. We hypothesize that this pollinator filtering behavior constitutes a crucial mechanism facilitating coevolution in multispecies plant-pollinator networks. However, pollinator recognition also greatly reduces the number of realized pollinators, thereby rendering mutualistic networks more vulnerable to environmental change.",2015

Despite or possibly because of this complexity, many studies focus on a single or few traits rather than studying floral phenotypes in a more integrated fashion. However, each of these distinct trait classes (signals/cues, morphology and resources) mediates interactions with floral visitors, demanding a more holistic view of flowers. In our review, we integrate floral scents into the broader context of the whole-flower phenotype. We discuss the functions of scent bouquets, colouration, morphology and rewards in flower visitor interactions from an ecological and evolutionary perspective in isolation and taken together. Studies demonstrate that floral scent bouquets can act additively or synergistically with other modalities, and that their effects on flower visitors are context-dependent. We also present field study results showing that reward levels modulate dose-dependent responses to volatiles by honeybees. To motivate studies examining complex floral phenotypes, we outline statistical approaches suited to deal with the complex multivariate datasets generated by these studies. We conclude with a discussion on why flowers display multimodal traits and suggest future research efforts. Our aim is to foster a fresh view on integrated floral phenotypes and stimulate studies exploring the combined effects of olfactory, visual, morphological and nutritional traits on flower animal interactions.",2015

Understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting gene flow is also critical for the development of appropriate management, breeding, and conservation programs. Here, we explored the natural and anthropogenic factors impacting crop-to-wild and within wild gene flow in apples in Europe using an unprecedented dense sampling of 1889 wild apple (Malus sylvestris) from European forests and 339 apple cultivars (Malus domestica). We made use of genetic, environmental, and ecological data (microsatellite markers, apple production across landscapes and records of apple flower visitors, respectively). We provide the first evidence that both human activities, through apple production, and human disturbance, through modifications of apple flower visitor diversity, have had a significant impact on crop-to-wild interspecific introgression rates. Our analysis also revealed the impact of previous natural climate change on historical gene flow in the nonintrogressed wild apple M.sylvestris, by identifying five distinct genetic groups in Europe and a north-south gradient of genetic diversity. These findings identify human activities and climate as key drivers of gene flow in a wild temperate fruit tree and provide a practical basis for conservation, agroforestry, and breeding programs for apples in Europe.",2015

Pollinator behavior is influenced by plants' floral traits, and these traits may be modified by interactions with other community members. In recent years, knowledge of ecological linkages between above-and belowground organisms has grown tremendously. Soil communities are extremely diverse, and when their interactions with plants influence floral characteristics, they have the potential to alter pollinator attraction and visitation, but plant-pollinator interactions have been neglected in studies of the direct and indirect effects of soil organism-root interactions. Here, we review these belowground interactions, focusing on the effects of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root-feeding herbivores, and their effects on floral traits and pollinators. Further, we identify gaps in our knowledge of these indirect effects and recommend promising directions and topics that should be addressed by future research. Important Findings Belowground organisms can influence a wide variety of floral traits that are important mediators of pollinator attraction, including the number and size of flowers and nectar and pollen production. Other traits that are known to influence pollinators in some plant species, such as floral volatiles, color and nectar composition, have rarely or never been examined in the context of belowground plant interactions. Despite clear effects on flowers, relatively few studies have measured pollinator responses to belowground interactions. When these indirect effects have been studied, both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root herbivores were found to shift pollinator visitation patterns. Depending on the interaction, these changes may either increase or decrease pollinator attraction. Finally, we discuss future directions for ecological studies that will more fully integrate belowground ecology with pollination biology. We advocate a multilevel approach to these questions to not only document indirect effect pathways between soil interactions and pollination but also identify the mechanisms driving changes in pollinator impacts and the resultant effects on plant fitness. A more thorough understanding of these indirect interactions will advance ecological theory and may inform management strategies in agriculture and conservation biology.",2015

A third factor was also included, testing whether different cultivars responded differently to the tested factors. Insect pollination was required to reach high yield and seed quality (oil content). Final benefits of pollination service were, however, greatly modified by cultivar, where the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar largely depended on insect pollination whereas the two hybrid cultivars did not. A near significant interaction between nitrogen input and insect pollination was also found, i.e. benefits to crop yield from insect pollination seemed to increase with decreased nitrogen levels. The differential response of the three cultivars suggested opportunities to use cultivars that are less dependent on insect pollination in landscapes where this service has been deteriorated. Increased access of nitrogen seems to partly compensate yield losses from poor insect pollination. Integrating conservation, environmental and agronomic sciences is therefore crucial to sustain agriculture productions through optimized management of agronomic inputs and biodiversity-based ecosystem services.

Studies on foraging preferences of pollinators combining experimental and observational approaches may help to understand the mechanisms behind patterns of interactions and niche partitioning within pollinator communities. In this study, we tested whether morphological floral traits were associated with foraging preferences of hummingbirds for artificial and natural flower types in Costa Rica. We performed field experiments with artificial feeders, differing in length and curvature of flower types, to quantify the hummingbirds' interaction niche under unlimited nectar resources. To quantify the interaction niche under real-world conditions of limited nectar resources, we measured foraging preferences of hummingbirds for a total of 34 plant species. Artificial feeders were visited by Eupherusa nigriventris and Phaethornis guy in the pre-montane forest, and Lampornis calolaemus in the lower montane forest. Under experimental conditions, all three hummingbird species overlapped their interaction niches and showed a preference for the short artificial flower type over the long-straight and the long-curved flower types. Under natural conditions, the two co-occurring hummingbird species preferred to feed on plant species with floral traits corresponding to their bill morphology. The short-billed hummingbird E.nigriventris preferred to feed on short and straight flowers, whereas the long- and curved-billed P.guy preferred long and curved natural flowers. The medium-size billed species L.calolaemus preferred to feed on flowers of medium length and did not show preferences for plant species with specific corolla curvature. Our results show that floral morphological traits constrain access by short-billed hummingbird species to nectar resources. Morphological constraints, therefore, represent one important mechanism structuring trophic networks. In addition, other factors, such as competition and differences in resource quantity or quality, define the interaction niches of consumer species in real-world communities, enforcing patterns of niche segregation between co-occurring consumer species. This suggests that experimental studies are needed to disentangle effects of morphological constraints from those of competition for resources in plant-pollinator interactions and other types of trophic interactions.",2015

However, little is known about the extent of IPT between interactive species and its causes. Methods To explore how sympatric flowering plants sharing pollinators minimize deleterious effects of IPT, we investigated the pollination ecology of two endemic species, Salvia przewalskii and Delphinium yuanum, in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains, southwest China. We quantified conspecific and interspecific visits by shared bumblebee pollinators, amounts of pollen placed on different body sites of the pollinators and stigmatic pollen loads on open-pollinated flowers. To examine whether IPT affects female fitness, we measured pollen germination and seed production in the two species in an artificial pollination experiment. Important Findings One bumblebee species, Bombus trifasciatus, was found to be the sole effective pollinator for the two coflowering species. Pollination experiments indicated that deposition of heterospecific pollen could significantly decrease seed set in both species. Experiments showed that S. przewalskii pollen could germinate well on stigmas of D. yuanum, inhibiting conspecific pollen germination in D. yuanum. However, seed set was not lower under open pollination than under cross-pollination within species, suggesting that no female fitness loss was caused by IPT. In foraging bouts with pollinator switches, switches from S. przewalskii to D. yuanum were relatively more frequent (8.27%) than the converse (1.72%). However, IPT from S. przewalskii to D. yuanum accounted for only 1.82% of total stigmatic pollen loads while the reverse IPT to S. przewalskii was 8.70%, indicating that more switches of bumblebees to D. yuanum did not result in higher IPT. By contrast, selection for reduced IPT to S. przewalskii would limit pollinator switches from D. yuanum. We found that a bumblebee generally carried pollen grains from both species but the two species differed in the position of pollen placement on the bumblebee's body; S. przewalskii's pollen was concentrated on the dorsal thorax while D. yuanum's pollen was concentrated ventrally on the head. This differential pollen placement along with pollinator fidelity largely reduced IPT between the two species with a shared pollinator.",2015
Multi-element Concentrations in Plant Parts and Fluids of Malaysian Nickel Hyperaccumulator Plants and some Economic and Ecological Considerations,Chemical fingerprinting; Ni-sink; Phloem sap; Phytomining,STREPTANTHUS-POLYGALOIDES BRASSICACEAE; OBLIGATE POLLINATION MUTUALISM; TREE SEBERTIA-ACUMINATA; TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; ELEMENTAL DEFENSE; COMMERCIAL PHYTOEXTRACTION; METAL HYPERACCUMULATION; SERPENTINE SOILS; NEW-CALEDONIA; ACCUMULATION,"Information about multi-elemental concentrations in different plant parts of tropical Ni hyperaccumulator species has the potential to provide insight into their unusual metabolism relative to a range of essential and non-essential elements, but this information is scant in the literature. As Ni hyperaccumulation, and possibly co-accumulation of other toxic elements, has been hypothesized to provide herbivore (insect) protection, there is a need to quantify a range of these elements in plant tissues and transport fluids to at least verify the possibility of this explanation. In this study, multiple elements were analyzed in a range of different plant parts and transport fluids from Ni hyperaccumulator species collected from Sabah (Malaysia). The results show preferential accumulation of Ni in leaves over woody parts, but the highest concentrations were found in the phloem tissue (up to 7.9 % in Rinorea bengalensis) and phloem sap (up to 16.9 % in Phyllanthus balgooyi), visible by a bright green coloration in the field fresh material. The amount of Ni contained in one mature R. bengalensis tree was calculated at 4.77 kg. The high Ni concentration in the flowers of Phyllanthus securinegoides could affect insect floral visitors and pollination. High concentrations of Ni in the seeds of this species also could supply the seedling with Ni and aid in herbivory protection during the first stages of development. Foliar Ca and Ni in P. cf. securinegoides and R. bengalensis are positively correlated. Low accumulation of Ca is desirable for phytomining but concentrations of Ca are high in most Ni hyperaccumulators examined, and this could have consequences for the economic viability of Ni extraction from bio ore if these species were to be used as 'metal crops'.",2015

These spatiotemporal patterns are hypothesized to provide additional information to floral visitors, but they are rarely measured, and their attendant hypotheses are even more rarely tested. In Penstemon digitalis, a plant whose floral scent has been shown to be under strong phenotypic selection for seed fitness, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in floral scent by using dynamic headspace collection, respectively solid-phase microextraction, and analyzed the volatile samples by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total volatile emission was greatest during flowering and peak pollinator activity hours, suggesting its importance in mediating ecological interactions. We also detected tissue and reward-specific compounds, consistent with the hypothesis that complexity in floral scent composition reflects several ecological functions. In particular, we found tissue-specific scents for the stigma, stamens, and staminode (a modified sterile stamen common to all Penstemons). Our findings emphasize the dynamic nature of floral scents and highlight a need for greater understanding of ecological and physiological mechanisms driving spatiotemporal patterns in scent production.",2015
Local adaptation: Mechanical fit between floral ecotypes of Nerine humilis (Amaryllidaceae) and pollinator communities,Advergent evolution; ecological speciation; long-proboscid fly; mechanical fit; pollination ecotypes; reciprocal translocation,MEDIATED SELECTION; FLOWER SIZE; EVOLUTION; ORCHID; PLANTS; DIVERSIFICATION; SPECIATION; MUTUALISM; TRAITS; CONVERGENCE,"Geographic variation in floral morphology is often assumed to reflect geographic variation in pollinator communities and associated divergence in selective pressures. We studied populations of Nerine humilis (Amaryllidaceae) to assess whether geographic variation in floral form is the result of local adaptation to different pollinator communities. We first tested for associations between floral traits and visitor communities, and found that populations with similar floral morphologies were visited by similar insect communities. Mean style length in each population was also closely associated with the mean body length of the local visitor community. A reciprocal translocation experiment demonstrated that native phenotypes set more seed than translocated phenotypes. Single visitation experiments showed that native flowers received more pollen, and set more seed per visit, than introduced phenotypes in both populations. This suggests that the effectiveness of pollinator visits is determined by the degree of mechanical fit between flowers and visitors. We provide strong evidence that the observed among-population variation in floral traits is an adaptive response to geographic variation in the pollinator community.",2015
Floral colour change in the eyes of pollinators: testing possible constraints and correlated evolution,angiosperm diversification; bees; butterflies; colour contrast; flies; floral pigment; green-receptor contrast; phylogenetic comparison; phylogenetic signal; visual ecology,PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; INSECT POLLINATORS; FLOWER COLORS; BUMBLE-BEES; VISION; DISCRIMINATION; HONEYBEES; ULTRAVIOLET; HYMENOPTERA; SENSITIVITY,"Many of the adaptive' traits in angiosperm flowers occur only in some species within a clade. One good example of such traits is floral colour change, that is the retention of old, nonreproductive, rewardless, but fully turgid flowers in an altered colour. This trait has been viewed as a plant strategy to enhance distant pollinator attraction while minimizing visits to nonreproductive flowers. Considering that the same scenario appears true for most visually oriented flower visitors, however, it is unclear why this trait does not prevail in nature. To understand such evolutionary patterns, we conducted a screening search for floral colour change in 219 angiosperm species. We quantified spectral alterations in petals or petaloid organs and translated them into colour shifts through insect eyes. Using phylogeny-based comparative methods, we further explored possibilities accounting for the infrequent occurrences of floral colour change: tendency of related species to resemble each other more than those randomly drawn from the phylogenetic tree (i.e. phylogenetic signal), constraints imposed through pigment coloration and their functions and evolutionary correlates of floral colour change. Ultraviolet-sensitive insect eyes were estimated to perceive floral colour change more often than previously noticed. We detected significant phylogenetic signal in the degree of floral colour change. The evolution of floral colour change appeared constrained by pigment chemistry, because greater changes were more likely to occur in yellow or red floral parts. Postchange colours tended to retain distant visual detectability (i.e. green-receptor contrast), while reducing attractiveness in a close range (i.e. colour contrast), indicating another constraint imposed through the functions of pigment coloration. Data also suggest a possible evolutionary association between floral colour change and bee pollination. Results indicate that floral colour change is scarce in nature because it primarily evolved to accommodate bees or comparable pollinators and because its occurrence was constrained by phylogenetic relatedness, pigment chemistry and ecological functions. An understanding of floral evolution thus requires considering different causalities for trait diversity in an integrative manner.",2015
Selection by Pollinators on Floral Traits in Generalized Trollius ranunculoides (Ranunculaceae) along Altitudinal Gradients,,POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; FLOWER SIZE; MEDIATED SELECTION; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT; REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS; POLLEN LIMITATION; SPATIAL VARIATION; NICOTIANA-GLAUCA,"Abundance and visitation of pollinator assemblages tend to decrease with altitude, leading to an increase in pollen limitation. Thus increased competition for pollinators may generate stronger selection on attractive traits of flowers at high elevations and cause floral adaptive evolution. Few studies have related geographically variable selection from pollinators and intraspecific floral differentiation. We investigated the variation of Trollius ranunculoides flowers and its pollinators along an altitudinal gradient on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and measured phenotypic selection by pollinators on floral traits across populations. The results showed significant decline of visitation rate of bees along altitudinal gradients, while flies was unchanged. When fitness is estimated by the visitation rate rather than the seed number per plant, phenotypic selection on the sepal length and width shows a significant correlation between the selection strength and the altitude, with stronger selection at higher altitudes. However, significant decreases in the sepal length and width of Trollius ranunculoides along the altitudinal gradient did not correspond to stronger selection of pollinators. In contrast to the pollinator visitation, mean annual precipitation negatively affected the sepal length and width, and contributed more to geographical variation in measured floral traits than the visitation rate of pollinators. Therefore, the sepal size may have been influenced by conflicting selection pressures from biotic and abiotic selective agents. This study supports the hypothesis that lower pollinator availability at high altitude can intensify selection on flower attractive traits, but abiotic selection is preventing a response to selection from pollinators.",2015
Autonomous self-pollination and insect visitors in partially and fully mycoheterotrophic species of Cymbidium (Orchidaceae),Autogamy; Mixotrophy; Mycoheterotrophy; Orchidaceae; Pollination biology; Self-pollination,EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES; MONOTROPOIDEAE ERICACEAE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; ENDANGERED ORCHID; BEE POLLINATION; FRUIT-SET; PLANTS; JAPAN; ECOLOGY,"Few studies have examined the reproductive ecology of mycoheterotrophic plants, but the existing literature hypothesizes that they adopt a self-pollinating strategy. Although growing evidence indicates that some rewarding mycoheterotrophic plants depend (at least partially) on an insect-mediated pollination system, it remains unclear whether some mycoheterotrophic plants can attract pollinators without nectar or other rewards. Moreover, in a broader evolutionary/ecological context, the question of whether the evolution of mycoheterotrophy induces a shift in pollination pattern is still unknown. Here I present a comparative investigation into the breeding system of two fully mycoheterotrophic orchids, Cymbidium macrorhizon and C. aberrans, and their closest extant relative, the mixotrophic C. lancifolium. Pollination experiments were conducted to determine the breeding system of these plants. In addition, flower visitors that might contribute to pollination were recorded. Flowers at different maturity stages were examined to investigate mechanisms enabling or limiting self-fertilization. While nectarless flowers of C. lancifolium and C. macrorhizon can successfully attract potential pollinator honeybees, all three Cymbidium possess an effective self-pollination system in which the rostellum that physically separates the stigma and pollinia is absent. Because mixotrophic and mycoheterotrophic Cymbidium occupy low-light niches, pollinator foraging would be negatively influenced by low-light intensity. In partial and fully mycoheterotrophic Cymbidium, autogamy would likely be favoured as a reproductive assurance to compensate for pollinator limitation due to their lack of nectar and pollinators' hostile habitat preferences.",2015

While webs of plant-animal interactions in natural systems can be highly complex, most interactions can be simplified into those that are either direct (mediated through pairwise interactions) or indirect (mediated through third-party species). Mechanistic studies of the direct and indirect pathways by which foliar herbivores affect plants have been well explored; however, mechanistic explorations of how floral herbivores, such as nectar robbers, affect total plant fitness via direct vs. indirect pathways have received less attention. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of direct vs. pollinator-mediated indirect effects of a floral antagonist on female and male components of plant fitness. We focused on the hummingbird-pollinated plant scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, which is nectar-robbed by the bumblebee Bombus occidentalis. Prior studies have found evidence for pollinator-mediated indirect effects of robbing on female and male components of I. aggregata fitness, but the mechanisms by which these indirect effects occur, and experimental evidence supporting or refuting direct effects of robbing, have been lacking. We found no evidence for direct effects of robbing on plant fitness. Robbers did not act as pollinators of I.aggregata nor did they directly affect seed production by making nectar-robber holes or removing nectar in hand-pollinated flowers. Moreover, robbing had no direct effect on pollen production per flower or the ability of pollen from robbed flowers to sire seeds in hand pollinations. However, nectar robbing had indirect effects on plant reproduction mediated through per-visit pollinator effectiveness at depositing pollen in robbed vs. unrobbed flowers. A simple model of a plant-robber-pollinator system suggested that robbing effects in general may occur through more indirect mechanisms when nectar removal by robbers is high relative to nectar replenishment, and that compensation for robbing is then more profitable through the production of additional flowers.Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of indirect effects in mediating the fitness consequences of species interactions.",2015
Sexual antagonism in the pistil varies among populations of a hermaphroditic mixed-mating plant,Collinsia heterophylla; conflict cost; delayed stigma receptivity; mixed-mating; pollen competition; sexually antagonistic coevolution,STIGMA RECEPTIVITY; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; DIVERGENT SELECTION; SELF-FERTILIZATION; FEMALE RESISTANCE; FLOWERING PLANTS; CONFLICT; COEVOLUTION; POLLEN; EVOLUTION,"Sexual conflicts and their evolutionary outcomes may be influenced by population-specific features such as mating system and ecological context; however, very few studies have investigated the link between sexual conflict and mating system. The self-compatible, mixed-mating hermaphrodite Collinsia heterophylla (Plantaginaceae) is thought to exhibit a sexual conflict over timing of stigma receptivity. This conflict involves (i) delayed stigma receptivity, which intensifies pollen competition, and (ii) early fertilization forced by pollen, which reduces seed set. We investigated the potential for the conflict to occur under field conditions and performed glasshouse crosses within eight populations to assess its consistency across populations. Flowers were visited, and produced seeds after pollination, at all developmental stages, suggesting that the conflict can be of significance under natural conditions. In the glasshouse, early pollination imposed costs in all populations. Overall, the timing of first seed set was most strongly affected by the maternal parent, denoting stronger female than male ability to influence the onset of stigma receptivity. Crosses also revealed a negative relationship between donor- and recipient-related onset of receptivity within individuals, a novel result hinting at trade-offs in sex allocation or a history of antagonistic selection. Neither timing of stigma receptivity, timing of first seed set, nor pollen competitive ability covaried with population outcrossing rate. In conclusion, these results indicate that sexually antagonistic selection may be present in varying degrees in different populations of C.heterophylla, but this variation does not appear to be directly related to mating system variation.",2015
High-elevation range limit of an annual herb is neither caused nor reinforced by declining pollinator service,Abundant centre distribution; autogamous pollination; Bombus; distribution boundary; elevation gradient; inbreeding; microsatellite markers; pollen limitation; reproductive ecology; visitation rate,CAMISSONIOPSIS-CHEIRANTHIFOLIA ONAGRACEAE; INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER; MIXED MATING SYSTEMS; HIGH TEMPERATE ANDES; SELF-FERTILIZATION; GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE; RHINANTHUS-MINOR; SPECIES RANGE; EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVES; PERIPHERAL-POPULATIONS,"Pollination failure has been proposed to be an important determinant of plant species' range limits if pollinator activity declines along an environmental gradient, directly limiting plant populations, or if plant populations decline along an environmental gradient and subsequently fail to attract sufficient visitation. Both mechanisms predict reduced pollinator visitation, increased pollen limitation and decreased seed production towards range limits, and the first additionally predicts declining pollinator abundance independent of any particular plant species. However, many self-compatible species have some capacity for autonomous self-fertilization, which may buffer reproductive success from declining pollinator visitation if inbreeding depression is mild. Thus pollinator-mediated limits may also predict selection for reduced reliance on pollinators towards range limits. We tested these predictions towards the high-elevation limit of the self-compatible, bumblebee (Bombus)-pollinated Rhinanthus minor, along two elevation transects in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada.Bombus abundance was highest at mid- (range-centre) and high-elevation (range limit) sites, so declining pollinator abundance is unlikely to impose high-elevation limits for bumblebee-pollinated species in this area. Flowers per plant and per m(2) declined at upper range limits, potentially rendering edge populations less attractive. However, visitation rate did not decline towards the range limit at either transect. Stigmatic pollen receipt declined with increasing elevation, but seed set did not, nor did outcross pollen supplementation increase seed set at any site. Investment in floral attractiveness (corolla area/ovary area) increased towards range limits, but capacity for high-quality autonomous seed set and adult inbreeding coefficients inferred from genetic markers were uniformly high, suggesting frequent self-fertilization and weak inbreeding depression throughout the range.Synthesis. We found no evidence for pollination failure towards the upper range limit of R.minor. Moreover, unlike some species with a capacity for autogamy, autonomous selfing makes a major contribution to R.minor's mating system and demography, and likely buffers reproductive success from stochasticity in pollination. Continued investment in floral attractiveness despite high autonomous selfing suggests some evolutionary benefit to pollinator-mediated outcrossing, rather than ecological benefits via increasing seed quantity or quality. Given that >50% of angiosperms are self-compatible, the reproductive assurance provided by selfing may reduce the importance of pollination in limiting plant distributions compared to other biotic interactions.",2015
Floral visitation by the Argentine ant reduces bee visitation and plant seed set,Argentine ant; bee visitation; biological invasion; Calystegia macrostegia; Halictidae; island morning glory; Linepithema humile; pollen limitation; pollination; visitation network,FLOWERING PLANTS; POLLINATION; MUTUALISMS; NECTAR; INDIVIDUALS; COMMUNITIES; INVASIONS; NETWORKS; SYSTEM,"Ants often visit flowers, but have only seldom been documented to provide effective pollination services. Floral visitation by ants can also compromise plant reproduction in situations where ants interfere with more effective pollinators. Introduced ants may be especially likely to reduce plant reproductive success through floral visitation, but existing experimental studies have found little support for this hypothesis. Here, we combine experimental and observational approaches to examine the importance of floral visitation by the nonnative Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) on plant species native to Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. First, we determine how L. humile affects floral visitor diversity, bee visitation rates, and levels of pollen limitation for the common, focal plant species island morning glory (Calystegia macrostegia ssp. macrostegia). Second, we assess the broader ecological consequences of floral visitation by L. hum lie by comparing floral visitation networks between invaded and uninvaded sites. The Argentine ant and native ants both visited island morning glory flowers, but L. humile was much more likely to behave aggressively towards other floral visitors and to be the sole floral occupant. The presence of L. humile in morning glory flowers reduced floral visitor diversity, decreased rates of bee visitation, and increased levels of pollen limitation. Network comparisons between invaded and uninvaded sites revealed differences in both network structure and species-level attributes. In invaded sites, floral visitors were observed on fewer plant species, ants had a higher per-plant interaction strength relative to that of other visitors, and interaction strengths between bees and plants were weaker. These results illustrate that introduced ants can negatively affect plant reproduction and potentially disrupt pollination services at an ecosystem scale.",2015
A comparison of reproductive strategies between island and mainland Caribbean Gesneriaceae,Caribbean; Gesneriaceae; island; mainland; pollination; reproductive ecology; self-pollination; specialization,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; FLORAL SPECIALIZATION; GALAPAGOS-ISLANDS; WEST-INDIES; NEW-ZEALAND; HUMMINGBIRD; NETWORKS; ECOLOGY,"The evolution of self-pollination has long been considered an adaptive strategy to cope with low or variable pollinator service; however, alternative reproductive strategies, such as generalized pollination (>1 pollinator functional group), may also ensure plant reproductive success in environments with inadequate pollinator visitation. Island-mainland systems provide ideal settings to assess the interaction between pollination and breeding systems in response to pollinator visitation because islands are often pollinator-depauperate. This study compared 28 insular and 26 mainland species of Caribbean Gesneriaceae to test the hypothesis that low diversity and possibly low pollinator service on islands would lead to a greater frequency of generalized plant-pollinator interactions and/or a higher potential for autonomous self-pollination in insular than in mainland species. We also assessed the hypothesis that epiphytic species should have greater autofertility than species occurring in other habitats. Pollinator observations conducted in the field from 2004 to 2014 revealed bat, bee, butterfly, hummingbird, moth, and generalized pollination systems. Functional specialization in pollination systems was high in insular (71% of the species) and mainland sites (all species), but generalized and bat-pollinated species were more common on islands. Overall, pollinator visitation rates did not differ between island and mainland; however, for hummingbird-pollinated species, visitation rate was on average three times higher in mainland than island species. Autofertility indices (fruit set of bagged/outcross flowers) ranged from 0 to 1 and did not differ between island and mainland species. Species growing on rocks (rupiculous) and trees (epiphytic) had on average higher autofertility than terrestrial species.Synthesis. This study revealed that alternative reproductive strategies are used in pollinator-depauperate environments. Pollinator visitation is lower in insular hummingbird-pollinated species (the ancestral pollination system of insular Gesneriaceae); therefore, generalized pollination may be considered a reproductive assurance mechanism evolved primarily on island environments. Contrary to the long-standing tenet, however, autonomous self-pollination was similar in island and mainland Gesneriaceae suggesting that: (i) generalized pollination provides a viable alternative to selfing in pollinator-depauperate environments, (ii) autofertility as a reproductive assurance mechanism may be frequent in plant species from mainland regions in environments with unpredictable pollinator visitation and resource availability.",2015
Unrivalled specialization in a pollination network from South Africa reveals that specialization increases with latitude only in the Southern Hemisphere,Cape Floristic Region; community ecology; functional specialization; hemispheric asymmetry; latitudinal trends; pollination syndrome; specialized pollination; two-dimensional Shannon entropy,MUTUALISTIC INTERACTION NETWORKS; CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; FLORAL SPECIALIZATION; INSECT DIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT; DIVERSIFICATION; COEXISTENCE; SPECIATION; PATTERNS,"Aim We aimed to produce the first complete pollination network for Africa to test (1) whether South African plants are unusually specialized in their interactions with pollinators, and (2) whether the South African data conform with global patterns of specialization. LocationCederberg, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa (32 degrees 0431.52S, 19 degrees 04 48.42E; elevation 320m). methods we sampled all plant-pollinator interactions within a 1-ha plot to assemble a network of 62 plant species linked to 217 pollinators species by 10,314 visits. We calculated the standardized Kullback-Leibler distance (d) as an estimate of plant and animal specialization, and standardized two-dimensional Shannon entropy (H-2) as an estimate of network-wide specialization. We compared these metrics with those calculated for 58 other networks from across the world. results ina global context, the South African plant species had an unusually high number of interaction partners (mean=6.32) while the animal species had unusually few (mean=1.81). Animal diversity was high relative to plant diversity (network asymmetry=0.56). Nevertheless, the South African plants, pollinators and network overall were more specialized than any previously studied community (weighted mean d plants=0.824 and animals=0.807, community H-2=0.834), suggesting functional specialization. Overall, specialization was found to increase sharply with latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas no relationship was found in the Northern Hemisphere. Main conclusions the findings that South African plants have a high diversity of pollinators and that specialization of pollination networks increases with latitude in the Southern Hemisphere only are in contradiction to expectations derived from earlier literature. Long-term climatic stability in the Southern Hemisphere might have allowed phenotypic and functional specialization to manifest and persist.",2015
Nectar sugars and bird visitation define a floral niche for basidiomycetous yeast on the Canary Islands,Basidiomycetes; Bird pollination; Boraginaceae; Canary Islands; Nectar-dwelling yeast,SOUTHERN SPANISH PLANTS; SOIL YEASTS; FLOWERS; COMMUNITIES; POLLINATION; TRAITS; ECOLOGY; BEES; IDENTIFICATION; FRAMEWORK,"Background: Studies on the diversity of yeasts in floral nectar were first carried out in the late 19th century. A narrow group of fermenting, osmophilous ascomycetes were regarded as exclusive specialists able to populate this unique and species poor environment. More recently, it became apparent that microorganisms might play an important role in the process of plant pollination. Despite the importance of these nectar dwelling yeasts, knowledge of the factors that drive their diversity and species composition is scarce. Results: In this study, we linked the frequencies of yeast species in floral nectars from various host plants on the Canary Islands to nectar traits and flower visitors. We estimated the structuring impact of pollination syndromes (nectar volume, sugar concentration and sugar composition) on yeast diversity. The observed total yeast diversity was consistent with former studies, however, the present survey yielded additional basidiomycetous yeasts in unexpectedly high numbers. Our results show these basidiomycetes are significantly associated with ornithophilous flowers. Specialized ascomycetes inhabit sucrose-dominant nectars, but are surprisingly rare in nectar dominated by monosaccharides. Conclusions: There are two conclusions from this study: (i) a shift of floral visitors towards ornithophily alters the likelihood of yeast inoculation in flowers, and (ii) low concentrated hexose-dominant nectar promotes colonization of flowers by basidiomycetes. In the studied floral system, basidiomycete yeasts are acknowledged as regular members of nectar. This challenges the current understanding that nectar is an ecological niche solely occupied by ascomycetous yeasts.",2015

It is most closely related to Thismia brunonis Gruff, from Myanmar, but differs in the number of flowers per inflorescence, the colour of the perianth tube, the length of the filaments, and the shape of the stigma lobes. We also provide inferences on the pollination ecology and seed dispersal of the new species, based on field observations and interpretations of morphology. The flowers are visited by fungus gnats (Myctophilidae or Sciaridae) and scuttle flies (Phoridae), which are likely to enter the perianth tube via the annulus below the filiform tepal appendages, and exit via small apertures between the filaments of the pendent stamens. The flowers are inferred to be protandrous, and flies visiting late-anthetic (pistillate-phase) flowers are possibly trapped within the flower, increasing chances of pollen deposition on the receptive stigma. The seeds are likely to be dispersed by rain splash.",2015
Ecological integration of eucalypts in Europe: Interactions with flower-visiting birds,Alien species; Bird pollination; Eucalyptus globulus; Mutualistic interactions; Naturalization; Novel ecosystems,GLOBULUS SSP GLOBULUS; EXOTIC PLANT INVASIONS; POLLINATED PLANT; POLLEN; PLANTATIONS; WARBLERS; HABITAT; NECTAR; VISITATION; MYRTACEAE,"The degree of ecological integration of an exotic species depends on the emergence of new interactions with the host community, either antagonistic or mutualistic, such as pollination. This will determine the impact of the new species on the host community (positive or negative, direct or indirect) as well as the capacity of the new species to sustain biodiversity. Eucalypts are the most widely planted trees in the world and depend on pollination by animals for seed production. Blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), one of the most commonly used and a dominant tree in NW of Spain, where this study has been conducted, is pollinated mainly by birds in its native range. In Europe pollination is mainly insect mediated, there are no specialized nectar-feeding birds and ornithophily (plant adaptation for bird pollination) is extremely rare (only recognized for one species, a Tertiary relict). Nevertheless, opportunistic nectar-feeding has been occasionally observed for some European songbirds. In this study, we determine the prevalence and strength of the interaction between eucalypts and birds by analyzing the occurrence and abundance of pollen in birds captured in mist nets in mixed landscapes with eucalypt plantations. Eucalypts represented the most important flower resource for the flower-visiting bird community. Eucalypt pollen was present in 171 individuals belonging to 19 bird species (out of the 485 birds captured in 33 species) and represented 98.2% of all pollen recorded. The large pollen loads found are indicative of frequent eucalypt flower use by the bird community. This study provides a good example of the ecological integration of a widely planted forestry species. The frequency of eucalypt pollen in birds points to the widespread use of this novel resource by birds and to the high ecological relevance of this interaction. The establishment of this novel interaction may favor seed production and, with it, population regeneration and spread of this exotic tree.    ",2015
Feeding damage to plants increases with plant size across 21 Brassicaceae species,Antagonists; Herbivory; Plant fitness; Pollen beetles; Trophic interactions,CEUTORHYNCHUS-ASSIMILIS PAYK; DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION; OILSEED RAPE; NAPUS L; HOST-PLANT; BODY-SIZE; POLLEN BEETLES; HERBIVORY; INSECTS; ARCHITECTURE,"Plant size is a major predictor of ecological functioning. We tested the hypothesis that feeding damage to plants increases with plant size, as the conspicuousness of large plants makes resource finding and colonisation easier. Further, large plants can be attractive to herbivores, as they offer greater amounts and ranges of resources and niches, but direct evidence from experiments testing size effects on feeding damage and consequently on plant fitness is so far missing. We established a common garden experiment with a plant size gradient (10-130 cm height) using 21 annual Brassicaceae species, and quantified plant size, biomass and number of all aboveground components (flowers, fruits, leaves, stems) and their proportional feeding damage. Plant reproductive fitness was measured using seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Feeding damage to the different plant components increased with plant size or component biomass, with mean damage levels being approximately 30 % for flowers, 5 % for fruits and 1 % for leaves and stems. Feeding damage affected plant reproductive fitness depending on feeding damage type, with flower damage having the strongest effect, shown by greatly reduced seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Finally, we found an overall negative effect of plant size on 1000 seed weight, but not on seed number and total seed weight. In conclusion, being conspicuous and attractive to herbivores causes greater flower damage leading to higher fitness costs for large plants, which might be partly counterbalanced by benefits such as enhanced competitive/compensatory abilities or more mutualistic pollinator visits.",2015

Nevertheless, the wide scope and generality of this phenomenon remain underestimated by the scientific community. This limited appreciation for the pervasiveness of recursive movement can be attributed to its study by parallel lines of research, with different methodologies and nomenclature, and almost no cross referencing among them. Among these lines of studies are traplining behavior in foraging ecology, path recursions in movement ecology and the ecology of fear in predator-prey studies. We synthesize these three lines of research, to underline the mechanisms driving these patterns and create a conceptual model for recursive movement behavior across species and spatio-temporal scales. The emergence and complexity of recursive movement patterns are determined by the rate of resource recovery, environmental heterogeneity, the predictability of resource recovery, and the animal's cognitive capabilities. Our synthesis can be used to generate predictions within and among systems, as well as to promote the sharing of knowledge and methodologies gained in each sub-field. Such sharing can greatly advance our understanding of behavioral and ecological processes and provide novel opportunities for future research.",2015

In some species, however, calyces are colorful and retained during seed development. Limonium species have been exploited as cut flower crops because the calyces persist for several months after the corolla has closed. To explore the adaptive significance of the persistent calyx in a desert plant Limonium leptolobum, we ask whether persistence of calyces can enhance pollinator attraction by enlarging floral displays, increasing reproductive success in this self-incompatible species. Methods The yellow flower of L. leptolobum lasted 1-2 days but its white, membranous calyx extended fully after the corolla closed, and persisted for over 2 months in the field, making hundreds of 'showy flowers' on one individual. To examine the ecological function of calyces, we test the pollinator attraction hypothesis. In an experimental population, we compared the difference in visit frequency and visitor behavior between intact inflorescences and inflorescences with their calyces removed on the same individual plants. Important findings In four experimental plots four types of floral visitors were observed including bees, butterflies, syrphid flies and day-flying moths. No significant preference was observed between calyx-free and intact inflorescences for both first arrivals and total visit frequency of all types of floral visitors, indicating that the persistence of calyces did not make plants more attractive to potential pollinators. The pollinator attraction hypothesis for the showy calyces was not supported by the current data. Whether the calyx in this desert plant helps seed development or has other functions needs further study.",2015
High incidence of pollen theft in natural populations of a buzz-pollinated plant,Buzz pollination; Pollen larceny; Pollen limitation; Pollen theft; Pollination efficiency; Solanum rostratum,MIRROR-IMAGE FLOWERS; SOLANUM-ROSTRATUM; FLORAL LARCENY; HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET; MELASTOMATACEAE; LIMITATION; ECOLOGY; BUMBLEBEES; FITNESS,"More than 20,000 angiosperm species possess non-dehiscent anthers that open through small pores at the anther's tip. These flowers are visited by bees that use vibrations to remove pollen, a phenomenon known as buzz pollination. However, some floral visitors fail to transfer pollen efficiently, either through a mismatch of flower and insect size, or because they are unable to buzz-pollinate. These visitors collect pollen, but provide little or no pollination, behaving as pollen thieves. Although pollen theft is widespread in plants, few studies have quantified the incidence of pollen thieves for buzz-pollinated plants. We use observations of natural populations and floral manipulations of Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae) to investigate the incidence of pollen theft, find morphological and behavioural differences between pollinators and thieves, measure the pollination efficiency of visitors, and characterize the reproductive ecology of this herb. We found that most visitors act as thieves, with < 20 % of all bees contacting the stigma. Insect visitors that regularly failed to contact the stigma (illegitimate visitors), included buzzing and non-buzzing bees, were significantly smaller, visited fewer flowers per bout, and stayed longer in each flower than (legitimate) visitors that regularly contact the stigma. Few flowers visited solely by illegitimate visitors set fruit. Our results show that S. rostratum requires insect visitation to set seed and natural populations experience moderate pollen limitation. We conclude that insect size, relative to the flower, is the main determinant of whether a visitor acts as a pollinator or a pollen thief in S. rostratum.",2015
Asymmetrical nature of the Trollius-Chiastocheta interaction: insights into the evolution of nursery pollination systems,Asymmetrical interactions; brood-site pollination; Chiastocheta; conditional outcomes; mutualism; plant-pollinator interactions; pollinator community; pollinator loss; reproductive ecology; reproductive success; Trollius europaeus,SEED SIZE; FLORAL SPECIALIZATION; FITNESS CONSEQUENCES; OBLIGATE MUTUALISM; EUROPAEUS; COSTS; PATTERNS; BENEFITS; FLIES; MOTHS,"The mutualistic versus antagonistic nature of an interaction is defined by costs and benefits of each partner, which may vary depending on the environment. Contrasting with this dynamic view, several pollination interactions are considered as strictly obligate and mutualistic. Here, we focus on the interaction between Trollius europaeus and Chiastocheta flies, considered as a specialized and obligate nursery pollination system - the flies are thought to be exclusive pollinators of the plant and their larvae develop only in T.europaeus fruits. In this system, features such as the globelike flower shape are claimed to have evolved in a coevolutionary context. We examine the specificity of this pollination system and measure traits related to offspring fitness in isolated T.europaeus populations, in some of which Chiastocheta flies have gone extinct. We hypothesize that if this interaction is specific and obligate, the plant should experience dramatic drop in its relative fitness in the absence of Chiastocheta. Contrasting with this hypothesis, T.europaeus populations without flies demonstrate a similar relative fitness to those with the flies present, contradicting the putative obligatory nature of this pollination system. It also agrees with our observation that many other insects also visit and carry pollen among T.europaeus flowers. We propose that the interaction could have evolved through maximization of by-product benefits of the Chiastocheta visits, through the male flower function, and selection on floral traits by the most effective pollinator. We argue this mechanism is also central in the evolution of other nursery pollination systems.",2015
Absence of nectar resource partitioning in a community of parasitoid wasps,Foraging ecology; Hymenoptera; Myrtaceae; Orchid; Pollination; Pollen load; Thynnidae,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; CALADENIA ORCHIDACEAE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; HYMENOPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; AUSTRALIA; CONSERVATION; MAINTENANCE,"Parasitoid wasps occur in diverse communities, with the adults of most species sourcing carbohydrates from nectar or honeydew. However, the role of niche partitioning of nectar resources in maintaining diverse communities of parasitoid Hymenoptera is poorly known. To elucidate patterns of nectar resource use and test whether species partition resources, we investigated pollen loads in a community of parasitoid thynnine wasps in the biodiversity hotspot of southwestern Australia. In total, 304 thynnine wasps from 28 species were captured. Eighteen of these species are undescribed, highlighting the high diversity of unrecognized species in southwestern Australia. Pollen loads were detected on 111 individuals representing 19 species. Six pollen types were identified. All species that carried pollen primarily visited two tree species, Agonis flexuosa and Eucalyptus marginata, in the Myrtaceae. The other four pollen types were only recorded from single wasps. There was no evidence of nectar-resource partitioning. This may be due to these Myrtaceae producing abundant, open-faced flowers. Wasp species that were not recorded carrying pollen may utilise other carbohydrate sources, such as homopoteran honeydew. Niche partitioning is predicted to occur during the parasitoid larval phase of the life cycle. This study highlights the importance of nectariferous Myrtaceae in supporting diverse wasp communities. Further, two species of nectar-foraging wasps collected here are involved in the pollination of rare orchid species. Hence, conservation and management of habitats that support floriferous Myrtaceae are important for both the maintenance of diverse wasp communities, and the plants they pollinate.",2015
"Natural history and biogeography of Partamona rustica, an endemic bee in dry forests of Brazil",Conservation; Constrictotermes cyphergaster; Ecological niche modeling; Nesting sites; Pollen analysis; Stingless bee,SPECIES GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; POLLEN HARVEST; STINGLESS BEES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION; POLLINATION; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPES; SERVICES,"Partamona rustica is a stingless bee that occupies dry forests of Brazil, such as the cerrado (savanna-like biome) and caatinga (xeric shrubland and thorn forest), ranging from the northern portion of the state of Minas Gerais to the southwestern portion of the Bahia state. As this bee is endemic to these environments and its biology is poorly known, the aim of the present study was to investigate aspects of its natural history and biogeography. Moreover, the potential distribution of the species is analyzed through ecological niche modeling. Sampling was performed in the full range of distribution of the species. Nesting sites for 145 colonies, plants visited, and termite nests hosts were identified. Most of the termite nests in which the species nested were active (83 %) and corresponded to Constrictotermes cyphergaster. Pollen analyses revealed 62 pollen types from 30 families of angiosperms visited by P. rustica, the most common of which were from the families Leguminosae-Mimosoideae (11.1 %) and Myrtaceae (7.9 %). Partamona rustica occurs in areas at 500 +/- A 187.30 m above sea level with semi-arid climates. The climatic niche model revealed a very realistic range for P. rustica, contouring the Chapada Diamantina National Park by the east, where there are no records of the species. Given the ecological importance of bees as pollinators, the intense pressure exerted by bee hunters and environmental changes caused by human activities, the present findings underscore the importance of concentrating efforts on the conservation of dry areas and the endemic species that inhabit these forests.",2015
AN ULTRAVIOLET FLORAL POLYMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY DRIVES POLLINATOR DISCRIMINATION IN MIMULUS GUTTATUS,Bombus impatiens; bumblebee; ethological isolation; floral constancy; life history; nectar guide; Phrymaceae; pollination ecology; pollinator isolation; ultraviolet,FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; MONKEYFLOWERS MIMULUS; BUMBLEBEE POLLINATION; MEDIATED SELECTION; SPECIES COMPLEX; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; TRAITS,"Premise of the study: Ultraviolet (UV) floral patterns are common in angiosperms and mediate pollinator attraction, efficiency, and constancy. UV patterns may vary within species, yet are cryptic to human observers. Thus, few studies have explicitly described the distribution or ecological significance of intraspecific variation in UV floral patterning. Here, we describe the geographic distribution and pattern of inheritance of a UV polymorphism in the model plant species Mimulus guttatus (Phrymaceae). We then test whether naturally occurring UV phenotypes influence pollinator interactions within Mimulus guttatus. Methods: We document UV patterns in 18 annual and 19 perennial populations and test whether UV pattern is associated with life history. To examine the pattern of inheritance, we conducted crosses within and between UV phenotypes. Finally, we tested whether bee pollinators discriminate among naturally occurring UV phenotypes in two settings: wild bee communities and captive Bombus impatiens. Key results: Within Mimulus guttatus, perennial populations exhibit a small bulls-eye pattern, whereas a bilaterally symmetric runway pattern occurs mainly in annual populations. Inheritance of UV patterning is consistent with a single-locus Mendelian model in which the runway phenotype is dominant. Bee pollinators discriminate against unfamiliar UV patterns in both natural and controlled settings. Conclusions: We describe a widespread UV polymorphism associated with life history divergence within Mimulus guttatus. UV pattern influences pollinator visitation and should be considered when estimating reproductive barriers between life history ecotypes. This work develops a new system to investigate the ecology and evolution of UV floral patterning in a species with extensive genomic resources.",2015
The relative importance of color signaling for plant generalization in pollination networks,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; LAND-USE INTENSITY; INTERACTION STRENGTH; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; INSECT VISITATION; FLOWER VISITORS; SPECIALIZATION; VISION; EVOLUTION; MULTIPLE,"Plant strategies frequently vary from opportunistic pollination to specialization to single pollinators within the same community. Unraveling the proximate mechanisms that determine the degree of plant generalization to pollinators has become a primary goal of pollination ecology. Color signaling is a potentially important mechanism because it is well established that many pollinators use color stimuli to locate food items. Until now, studies on the importance of color signaling in structuring pollination networks have not considered floral coloration as it is perceived by pollinators. Here, we use a framework recently developed for network analyses to compare the relative importance of color matching (i.e. the degree of phenotypic matching between flower coloration and pollinators' visual system) and other variables (phylogeny, co-abundance and spatiotemporal overlap between plants and pollinators) for plant generalization. We analyzed 25 000 visits in three temperate regions. We show that color matching in combination with spatiotemporal overlap or co-abundance significantly influences plant generalization in one of the three regions. We suggest that intense human activities in two regions have decreased the mean level of color matching, potentially disrupting the communication between plants and pollinators. This study illuminates how the sensory ecology of pollinators contributes to structure a highly diversified pollination network.",2015
AN INVASIVE PLANT ALTERS POLLINATOR-MEDIATED PHENOTYPIC SELECTION ON A NATIVE CONGENER,Impatiens capensis; Impatiens glandulifera; plant invasions; pollen interference; pollinator constancy; pollinator-mediated selection,REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; IMPATIENS-CAPENSIS BALSAMINACEAE; FLORAL TRAITS; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; NATURAL-SELECTION; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; MIMULUS-RINGENS; POLLEN REMOVAL; COMPETITION; COMMUNITIES,"Premise of study: Recent studies suggest that invasive plants compete reproductively with native plants by reducing the quantity or quality of pollinator visits. Although these studies have revealed ecological consequences of pollinator-mediated competition between invasive and native plants, the evolutionary outcomes of these interactions remain largely unexplored. Methods: We studied the ecological and evolutionary impact of pollinator-mediated competition with an invasive jewelweed, Impatiens glandulifera, on a co-occurring native congener, I. capensis. Using a pollinator choice experiment, a hand pollination experiment, and a selection analysis, we addressed the following questions: (1) Do native pollinators show preference for the invasive or native jewelweed, and do they move between the two species? (2) Does invasive jewelweed pollen inhibit seed production in the native plant? (3) Does the invasive jewelweed alter phenotypic selection on the native plant's floral traits? Key results: The pollinator choice experiment showed that pollinators strongly preferred the invasive jewelweed. The hand pollination experiment demonstrated that invasive pollen inhibited seed production in the native plant. The selection analysis showed that the presence of the invasive jewelweed altered phenotypic selection on corolla height in the native plant. Conclusions: Invasive plants have the potential to alter phenotypic selection on floral traits in native plant populations. If native plants can evolve in response to this altered selection pressure, the evolution of floral traits may play an important role in permitting long-term coexistence of native and invasive plants.",2015
Is the timing of scent emission correlated with insect visitor activity and pollination in long-spurred Satyrium species?,Cape flora; floral volatile; hawkmoth; linalool; methyl nicotinate; ocimene; settling moth,FLORAL SCENT; NOCTURNAL POLLINATION; FLOWER SCENT; SOUTH-AFRICA; FRAGRANCE CHEMISTRY; SILENE-LATIFOLIA; ORCHIDACEAE; CARYOPHYLLACEAE; MOTH; EVOLUTION,"Plants are expected to emit floral scent when their pollinators are most active. In the case of long-tubed flowers specialised for pollination by crepuscular or nocturnal moths, scent emissions would be expected to peak during dawn. Although this classic idea has existed for decades, it has rarely been tested quantitatively. We investigated the timing of flower visitation, pollination and floral scent emissions in six long-spurred Satyrium species (Orchidaceae). We observed multiple evening visits by pollinaria-bearing moths on flowers of all study species, but rarely any diurnal visits. The assemblages of moth pollinators differed among Satyrium species, even those that co-flowered, and the lengths of moth tongues and floral nectar spurs were strongly correlated, suggesting that the available moth pollinator fauna is partitioned by floral traits. Pollinarium removal occurred more frequently during the night than during the day in four of the six species. Scent emission, however, was only significantly higher at dusk than midday in two species. Analysis of floral volatiles using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry yielded 168 scent compounds, of which 112 were species-specific. The scent blends emitted by each species occupy discrete clusters in two-dimensional phenotype space, based on multivariate analysis. We conclude that these long-spurred Satyrium species are ecologically specialised for moth pollination, yet the timing of their scent emission is not closely correlated with moth pollination activity. Scent composition was also more variable than expected from a group of closely related plants sharing the same pollinator functional group. These findings reveal a need for greater understanding of mechanisms of scent production and their constraints, as well as the underlying reasons for divergent scent chemistry among closely related plants.",2015
"The Impact of the Invasive Alien Plant, Impatiens glandulifera, on Pollen Transfer Networks",,POLLINATOR NETWORKS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; COMMUNITY; STIGMA; DEPOSITION; SUCCESS; VISITATION; ASTERACEAE; TOLERANCE; RECEIPT,"Biological invasions are a threat to the maintenance of ecological processes, including pollination. Plant-flower visitor networks are traditionally used as a surrogated for pollination at the community level, despite they do not represent the pollination process, which takes place at the stigma of plants where pollen grains are deposited. Here we investigated whether the invasion of the alien plant Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) affects pollen transfer at the community level. We asked whether more alien pollen is deposited on the stigmas of plants on invaded sites, whether deposition is affected by stigma type (dry, semidry and wet) and whether the invasion of I. glandulifera changes the structure of the resulting pollen transfer networks. We sampled stigmas of plants on 10 sites invaded by I. glandulifera (hereafter, balsam) and 10 non-invaded control sites. All 20 networks had interactions with balsam pollen, although significantly more balsam pollen was found on plants with dry stigmas in invaded areas. Balsam pollen deposition was restricted to a small subset of plant species, which is surprising because pollinators are known to carry high loads of balsam pollen. Balsam invasion did not affect the loading of native pollen, nor did it affect pollen transfer network properties; networks were modular and poorly nested, both of which are likely to be related to the specificity of pollen transfer interactions. Our results indicate that pollination networks become more specialized when moving from the flower visitation to the level of pollen transfer networks. Therefore, caution is needed when inferring pollination from patterns of insect visitation or insect pollen loads as the relationship between these and pollen deposition is not straightforward.",2015

The role of nocturnal moths within plant-pollinator networks is poorly understood but could be important in the context of declining biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. For the first time, this study examined the role of moths as pollen vectors in the Mediterranean Biodiversity Hotspot. Light traps were used to sample moths in SW Portugal in 2010. The pollen on moth head parts was collected, identified, and counted to construct a nocturnal pollen-transfer and flower-visitor network. A total of 257 moths belonging to 95 species were captured in 11 trapping sessions in 2010; 196moths (76%) carried pollen and the total number of pollen grains counted and identified was 9064. The pollen-transfer network exhibited a high degree of selectivity (H2) but low robustness when the most-to-least connected plants were made extinct in the network. The flower-visitor network (based on the incidences of interactions by individual moths), however, exhibited high linkage density and was generally more robust to simulated plant or moth extinction. Including nocturnal moths in plant-pollinator networks will provide a better understanding of their robustness to species extinctions due to environmental change as well as the impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. Nocturnal pollen-transfer networks could be developed for identifying key species for targeted conservation.",2015
Topology of Plant - Flower-Visitor Networks in a Tropical Mountain Forest: Insights on the Role of Altitudinal and Temporal Variation,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; HIGH TEMPERATE ANDES; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS; CENTRAL CHILE; FOOD WEBS; SPECIALIZATION; COMMUNITY; CONNECTANCE,"Understanding the factors determining the spatial and temporal variation of ecological networks is fundamental to the knowledge of their dynamics and functioning. In this study, we evaluate the effect of elevation and time on the structure of plant-flower-visitor networks in a Colombian mountain forest. We examine the level of generalization of plant and animal species and the identity of interactions in 44 bipartite matrices obtained from eight altitudinal levels, from 2200 to 2900 m during eight consecutive months. The contribution of altitude and time to the overall variation in the number of plant (P) and pollinator (A) species, network size (M), number of interactions (I), connectance (C), and nestedness was evaluated. In general, networks were small, showed high connectance values and non-nested patterns of organization. Variation in P, M, I and C was better accounted by time than elevation, seemingly related to temporal variation in precipitation. Most plant and insect species were specialists and the identity of links showed a high turnover over months and at every 100 m elevation. The partition of the whole system into smaller network units allowed us to detect small-scale patterns of interaction that contrasted with patterns commonly described in cumulative networks. The specialized but erratic pattern of network organization observed in this tropical mountain suggests that high connectance coupled with opportunistic attachment may confer robustness to plant-flower-visitor networks occurring at small spatial and temporal units.",2015
Odd for an Ericad: Nocturnal Pollination of Lyonia lucida (Ericaceae),,DISTERIGMA-STEREOPHYLLUM ERICACEAE; LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY; FLORAL TRAITS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SYSTEMS; SPECIALIZATION; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; FOREST,"Studies of pollination biology are largely diurnally biased, especially in plant species whose flowers conform to diurnal pollination syndromes. Though these syndromes can be useful in generating hypotheses regarding a species' primary pollinators, they may also lead to incorrect assumptions. This study explores the relative contributions of diurnal and nocturnal pollination to fruit set in Lyonia lucida, an ericaceous shrub of the southeastern United States whose floral form suggests pollination by bumble bees. Floral visitation to L. lucida and pollen loads of visitors were quantified in a population of the species in Central Florida (U.S.A.), and the relative contributions of diurnal and nocturnal pollination tested. Mating system characteristics of L. lucida were also examined. Results show L. lucida flowers are visited mainly by nocturnal moths, who are capable of carrying large pollen loads, and nocturnal pollination is the primary driver of fruit set. In addition L. lucida at the study site shows severe barriers to selfing and strong pollen limitation. This is the first time a population of an ericaceous species has been shown to be pollinated primarily by nocturnal floral visitors and suggests pollination biologists should not be so quick to discount these potentially important pollinators.",2015
The ecological role of extremely long-proboscid Neotropical butterflies (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) in plant-pollinator networks,Skippers; Calathea; Insect-plant interaction; Foraging behavior; Coevolution,DEEP COROLLA TUBES; EUGLOSSINE BEES; EVOLUTION; FLOWERS; MORPHOLOGY; ORCHIDACEAE; MUTUALISM; TONGUES; LENGTH; CONSTRAINTS,"Extremely long proboscides of insect flower visitors have been regarded as an example of a coevolutionary arms race, assuming that these insects act as efficient pollinators for their nectar host plants. However, the effect of proboscis length on generalized or specialized flower use remains unclear and the efficiency of butterfly pollination is ambiguous. Neotropical Hesperiidae feature a surprising variation of proboscis length, which makes them a suitable study system to elucidate the role of extremely long-proboscid insects in plant-pollinator networks. The results of this study show that skippers with longer proboscides visit plant species with deep-tubed flowers to take up food, but do not pollinate them. Skippers equipped with extremely long proboscides seldom include short-tubed flowers in their diet nor visit more plant species than those with shorter proboscides. Our observations indicate that the extremely long-proboscid skippers steal nectar from their preferred nectar host plants, Calathea sp., instead of contributing to their pollination. Finally, we discuss the impact of nectar robbery by these butterflies on their nectar host plants and their legitimate pollinators, euglossine bees.",2015

We examined whether geographical differentiation occurred for rewards, and whether this could be explained by spatially heterogeneous pollinator guilds and climate. Rewards were measured across the entire species range. Geographical patterns of reward quantity and their relationships with biotic and abiotic factors were examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Latitude significantly explained population variation in nectar and oils, although in contrasting ways. Pollinator assemblages showed a prevalence of oil-collecting Centris bees. Centris vardyorum, specialized on M.aphylla, showed a latitudinal pattern of visits. Oil production was not higher where plants associated with ecologically specialized bees (i.e. C.vardyorum), but this occurred instead where they were less frequent and co-occurred with other bees that used many floral sources, including other plant species that produce oil. The multivariate analysis showed that the prevalence of C.vardyorum was the factor that contributed most significantly to the combined patterns of rewards. We suggest that large-scale variation in rewards involves local optima throughout the species range, related to processes that operate in each ecoregion with their particular biotic and abiotic scenarios.

The generalist Inga subnuda subsp luschnathiana (Fabaceae): negative effect of floral visitors on reproductive success?,Generalist pollination system; pollen removal; polyads; reproduction,FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; NOCTURNAL POLLINATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; POLLEN LIMITATION; MIMOSOIDEAE; SYSTEMS; MATTER; TREES; COMPETITION; EXTINCTION,"Inga species are characterised by generalist or mixed pollination system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some ecological and genetic factors are associated with this feature, and to test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efficacy of polyads deposited on stigmas of flowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to visitors. The proportion of polyads fixed in stigmas decreased after exposure to visitors (24h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from visitors (hummingbirds, bees, wasps, hawkmoths and bats), and fruit set was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and other floral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production, sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main pollinators; although the brush-flower morphology, time of anthesis, nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors. Thus the species is an important resource for a diverse group of floral visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are responsible for the decrease in fixed polyads in stigmas of I.subnuda subsp. luschnathiana flowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural conditions could be the result of a negative effect of visitors/pollinators.",2015

We used a common-garden field test containing seven native North American willow species to assess attractiveness of male and female flower catkins by documenting visits of Andrena spp. (Apoidea: Anthophila), other wild bees (all native), and flower flies (Syrphidae). Most willows in Canada's Maritimes begin flowering very early in spring, as the first wild pollinators become active following winter, and stop flowering by mid-May. A later-flowering group normally begins flowering in mid-May and stops flowering by mid-June. Pollinator species were largely opportunistic, visiting whatever species of willow flowers were available during foraging, but Andrena dunningi appeared to prefer flowers of S. nigra and S. interior. There was a general preference for male flower catkins, with 72% of Andrena spp. and 82% of all flower flies collecting pollen and/or nectar from male flowers, because pollen is the major component of nest provisioning for most solitary bees and the major source of protein used to develop reproductive tissues in most flower flies. Most andrenids and flower flies were collected within the April-June flowering period of six of the seven willow species studied, indicating that these willows could be used to support the pollinator community before the flowering period of commercially valuable flower-pollinated crops such as lowbush blueberry, cranberry, and apple.",2015
Effects of experimentally simulated pollinator decline on recruitment in two European herbs,Centaurea jacea; Leucanthemum vulgare; pollinator loss; reproductive ecology; seed set; seed weight; seedling density; visitation rate,POLLEN-LIMITATION; SEED SIZE; PLANT REPRODUCTION; VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS; MICROSITE LIMITATION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; RESOURCE LIMITATION; OUTCROSSING RATES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; MIMULUS-RINGENS,"Pollinator decline causes great concern because reduced pollinator availability may negatively affect plants' seed production and in turn influence seedling recruitment and densities of plant populations. We used a novel experimental approach that simulates pollinator decline to assess the effects of a 4-year reduction in pollinator availability on reproduction and recruitment in two common European herbs, Centaurea jacea and Leucanthemum vulgare. The experiment strongly reduced visitation rates (by 59%) and seed set (by 23%) in Leucanthemum, but this did not cause reduced seedling recruitment, suggesting that other factors, such as water availability or the existence of a seed bank, are important for recruitment in this population of Leucanthemum. The experiment also significantly reduced visitation rates to Centaurea (by 33%), but did not affect seed set or seedling recruitment. In this species, however, seed set increased with visitation rates and local recruitment increased with seed production, indicating that a consistent pollinator decline may negatively affect Centaurea population densities.Synthesis. Our experiment reduced pollinator availability without artificially affecting quality components of the pollination process. Therefore, this approach may represent a realistic simulation of a pollinator decline. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses an experimental reduction in pollinator visitation to assess its effects on population recruitment in plants. This study shows that a large pollinator decline may affect population densities, but only in populations where seedling recruitment is limited by seed production. Our results also highlight the importance of going beyond visitation rates and seed production to study the impact of pollinator decline on plant populations.",2015
The specialization and structure of antagonistic and mutualistic networks of beetles on rainforest canopy trees,Australian Canopy Crane; Coleoptera; Daintree Rainforest Observatory; flower-visitors; herbivory; interaction,INSECT HERBIVORES; HOST-SPECIFICITY; FLORAL BIOLOGY; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; TROPICAL FORESTS; NORTH QUEENSLAND; PLANT; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; GENERALIST,"Different kinds of species interactions can lead to different structures within ecological networks. Antagonistic interactions (such as between herbivores and host plants) often promote increasing host specificity within a compartmentalized network structure, whereas mutualistic networks (such as pollination networks) are associated with higher levels of generalization and form nested network structures. However, we recently showed that the host specificity of flower-visiting beetles from three different feeding guilds (herbivores, fungivores, and predators) in an Australian rainforest canopy was equal to that of herbivores on leaves, suggesting that antagonistic herbivores on leaves are no more specialized than flower-visitors. We therefore set out to test whether similarities in the host specificity of these different assemblages reflect similarities in underlying network structures. As shown before at the species level, mutualistic communities on flowers showed levels of specialization at the network scale similar to those of the antagonistic herbivore community on leaves. However, the network structure differed, with flower-visiting assemblages displaying a significantly more nested structure than folivores, and folivores displaying a significantly more compartmentalized structure than flower-visitors. These results, which need further testing in other forest systems, demonstrate that both antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can result in equally high levels of host specialization among beetle assemblages in tropical rainforests. If this is a widespread phenomenon, it may alter our current perceptions of food web dynamics, species diversity patterns, and co-evolution in tropical rainforests.",2015
Sex-dependent selection on flower size in a large-flowered Mediterranean species: an experimental approach with Cistus ladanifer,Female fitness; Fruit set; Male fitness; Pollen dispersal; Pollinator visit rates; Seed number,POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; GORTERIA-DIFFUSA ASTERACEAE; FLORAL TRAITS; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; NATURAL-SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; GYMNADENIA-CONOPSEA; POLLEN LIMITATION; SPUR LENGTH,"Larger flowers increase pollinator visit rates and reproductive success, so selection on flower size is usually mediated by pollinators. However, larger flowers involve costs imposed by resource limitation so environmental conditions may also modulate flower size. ""Male function"" hypothesis entails that the intensity of selection is sex-dependent, being greater through male fitness, whereas female fitness is more limited by resources. In this study we analyse pollinator-mediated phenotypic selection on flower size through both sexes in a large-flowered Mediterranean species, Cistus ladanifer. We experimentally manipulated flower size in two populations, measured its effect on male and female fitness and estimated the strength and direction of phenotypic selection through both sexes and populations. Unmanipulated control flowers received higher pollinator visit rates and dispersed a higher pollen amount than reduced flowers. This translated into selection towards larger flowers through male fitness in both populations. Nevertheless, flower size had little effect on female fitness. Fruit set was high but selection through this component of female function was not significant. Seed number increased in control flowers, especially in one population, where we detected positive selection on flower size. Our results suggest that pollinator-mediated phenotypic selection on flower size in this large-flowered Med-iterranean species is especially modulated by male fitness, but flower size adjustment may also be a result of a simultaneous selection through both sexes that, in turn, is dependent of ecological context.",2015

Still, the effects of lower fruit set due to pollen limitation on plant demography and population persistence have rarely been explored. The objectives of this study were to assess the ecological factors determining female reproductive success and to study the impact of pollen limitation on population growth of Dracocephalum austriacum L. (Lamiaceae), a critically endangered species with a discontinuous distribution across Europe. Despite the significant background information gathered on the population dynamics and genetic diversity of D. austriacum, little is known about its reproductive strategy and the effect it has on population growth. Thus, the reproductive system, pollinator assemblage and pollen limitation were studied in natural populations and the impact of pollen-limited seed production on population growth was assessed using existing transition matrix models. The results revealed that D. austriacum is protandrous self-compatible species that produces very few seeds in the absence of pollinators. The flowers are visited by several insects, including legitimate pollinators (e.g., Bombus hortorum, Osmia spp.) and nectar robbers (other Bombus spp., O. aurulenta). Fruit and seed production was significantly pollen-limited in all populations studied. However, despite the positive effect of pollen supplementation on seed production, the resulting increase in seed number did not significantly increase population growth rates in any of the studied populations. Hence, we conclude that populations are demographically stable and current natural seed production is sufficient for the species' persistence.",2015
Floral integration and pollinator diversity in the generalized plant-pollinator system of Alstroemeria ligtu (Alstroemeriaceae),Floral evolution; Generalization; Natural selection; Phenotypic integration; Pollination,PHENOTYPIC INTEGRATION; CORRELATION-PLEIADES; GENETIC CORRELATIONS; NATURAL-SELECTION; WILD RADISH; TRAITS; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; POPULATIONS; COVARIANCE,"Floral integration may result from the combined effects of pollinator-mediated selection, genetic correlations and abiotic factors. Thus, by sampling a set of populations in the field and examining their variation of floral correlations in relation to pollinators and abiotic factors, we intended to shed light on the ecological factors underlying the evolution of floral integration. In this study, floral integration patterns and the composition of pollinator assemblage were characterized across ten populations of Alstroemeria ligtu to test the following: (1) Whether the patterns of floral integration estimated at population level covary with the composition of local pollinator assemblage, climate and/or geographic distance. (2) Whether the magnitude of floral integration decreases with the number or the morphological variability of pollinators. (3) Whether the behavior of the three most widespread pollinators is affected by floral integration. Our results indicated that populations with similar patterns of integration showed greater similitude in pollinator assemblages, but that this was not related to climate or geographic distance. We also found that the most widespread pollinator, Centris nigerrima, invested lower handling time in populations with higher levels of floral integration. The magnitude of floral integration was not related to taxonomical diversity, yet, unexpectedly, correlated positively with the variability of pollinator proboscis length. We suggest that variation in the magnitude and pattern of floral integration across the species range was related to the composition of pollinator assemblage, and not to pollinator diversity per se, nor to climatic variables. A. ligtu was visited by numerous pollinators, but floral integration patterns are likely shaped by only a subset of them, such as C. nigerrima, which is sensitive to variations in floral architecture.",2015
Structural and ultrastructural characterization of the floral lip in Gongora bufonia (Orchidaceae): understanding the slip-and-fall pollination mechanism,fragrance; Gongora; Orchidaceae; pollination; ultrastructure; wax,MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; FRAGRANCE COLLECTION; OSMOPHORES; APIDAE; MORPHOLOGY; FEATURES; FLOWER,"In this study, we investigated the pollination ecology and floral lip morphology of Gongora bufonia Lindl., an epiphytic orchid from tropical forest, to better understand the peculiarities of its unusual pollination mechanism. Field observations on pollination were performed and floral lip samples were prepared for anatomical, histochemical, and ultrastructural analyses. Male Eufriesea violacea (Blanchard) bees use the second and third pairs of legs to hold on the epichile and collect the fragrance in the hypochile region. During this process, the bee slips and falls on the column and receives the pollinarium, which is attached to the rear edge of the bee's scutellum. A subsequent visit (usually to another flower) and fall through the flower may result in insertion of a pollinium into the stigmatic slit at the apex of the column. The fragrance production occurs in the hypochile region, specifically in the papillose epidermal cells and in the subepidermal parenchyma layers. The wax production occurs in the epichile region, exclusively in the epidermal cells. The cells of both regions, hypochile and epichile, have ultrastructural features of lipophilic secretion. The slippery quality of the epichile epidermis is due to wax deposits; this is probably essential to the pollination mechanism of G. bufonia.",2015
Structure-dynamic relationship of plant-insect networks along a primary succession gradient on a glacier foreland,Bipartite network; Chronosequence; Community assembly; Ecological network; Ecosystem stability,ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; CONNECTANCE; CHRONOSEQUENCE; COMMUNITIES; POLLINATION; ROBUSTNESS,"There is a growing interest in understanding the structure-dynamic relationship of ecological networks. Ecological network changes along primary successions are poorly known: to address such topic, gradient of primary succession on glacier forelands is an ideal model, as sites of different age since deglaciation stand for different ecosystem developmental stages. We aimed to investigate the assembly processes of plant-insect networks and to elucidate its functional implications for ecosystem stability along this time sequence succession. We collected data on the functional role of anthophilous insect groups and performed network analysis to evaluate their relative importance in the structure of plant-insect interaction networks with increasing time since deglaciation along the primary succession of a debris-covered glacier foreland. We sampled anthophilous insects visiting the flowers of two models plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina and Saxifraga bryoides. Insects were identified and trophic roles were attributed to each taxon (detritivores, parasitoids, phytophagous, pollinators, predators, and opportunists) at five sites representing the primary succession gradient. Plant-insect interactions were visually represented by a bipartite network for each successional stage. For each plant species and insect group, centrality indices were computed quantifying their community importance. For the whole network, centralization and link density were calculated. Pollinators dominated pioneer communities on the debris-covered glacier and in recently deglaciated areas, while parasitoids, predators and opportunists characterised late-succession stages. Plant species centrality varied along the succession. Pollinators showed initially higher but then decreasing centrality, while the centrality of predators and parasitoids increased with time since deglaciation. Along the same gradient link density showed an increasing trend while network centralization tended to decrease. The present study provides new insight into the initial steps of plant-insect network assembly and sheds light on the relationship between structure and dynamic in ecological networks. In particular, during the succession process, more links are formed and plant-anthophilous insect interactions change from a network dominated by pollinators to a functionally more diversified food web. We conclude that applying network theory to the study of primary succession provides a useful framework to investigate the relationship between community structure and ecosystem stability.    ",2015
Breaking-bud pollination: a new pollination process in partially opened flowers by small bees,Body size; Lasioglossum japonicum; Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea; Pollination mechanism,POLLEN DISPERSAL; FORAGING RANGES; PLANT; SPECIALIZATION; AMARYLLIDACEAE; CLEISTOGAMY; XYRIDACEAE; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS,"Plant-pollinator interactions have usually been researched in flowers that have fully opened. However, some pollinators can visit flowers before full opening and contribute to fruit and seed sets. In this paper, we researched the pollination biology of flowers just starting to open in four field experiments. We observed the insect visitors to Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea for 3 years at five sites. These observations revealed that only small bees, Lasioglossum japonicum, often entered through tiny spaces between the tepals of 'breaking buds' (i.e. partially opened flowers) and collected pollen. We hypothesized that they can pollinate this species at the breaking-bud stage, when the stigma is located near the anthers. To measure the pollination effect of small bees at the breaking-bud stage, we bagged several breaking buds after small bees had visited them and examined whether these buds were pollinated. In bagging experiments, 30 % of the breaking buds set fruit and seeds. Fruit-set ratios of the breaking buds did not differ significantly from those of the fully opened flowers, which had been visited by several insect species. We also counted the pollen grain numbers on the body of L. japonicum and on the anthers of randomly-selected and manipulated flowers. These experiments revealed that all of the captured bees had some pollen of target plants and that L. japonicum collected most of the pollen grains at the breaking-bud stage. Our results showed that the new pollination process, breaking-bud pollination, happened in breaking buds by L. japonicum, although there is no evidence to reveal that this is the most effective pollination method for L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. In principle, this new pollination process can occur in other flowering plants and our results are a major contribution to studies of plant-pollinator interactions.",2015
Effect of change in floral openness with floral age on floral display and reproduction in Gentiana,Floral age; Floral display; Floral openness; Pollination; Seed production,COLOR-CHANGE; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE; SOUTHERN AFRICA; BEE BEHAVIOR; PLANT SIZE; SUCCESS; FLOWERS; BORAGINACEAE; GEITONOGAMY,"Some plant species have flowers that open widely and then close slowly over time, resulting in changes in the width of the corolla opening. We examined the adaptive significance of retaining flowers with relatively closed corollas using Gentiana triflora var. japonica, a perennial species with petal movement, in Hakkoda, northern Japan. Under open pollination, floral openness changed with floral age. It increased from days 1-3 after the flower initially opened and decreased thereafter until floral senescence. Hand-pollinated flowers showed a significant reduction in floral openness compared with unpollinated flowers, suggesting that a floral openness reflects its demand for pollination. Pollinators visited inflorescences with many flowers irrespective of their openness, suggesting that the reduction in floral openness does not affect the attractiveness of the inflorescences to pollinators. Within inflorescences, pollinators visited less-pollinated flowers with wider floral openness more frequently and more-pollinated flowers with lower floral openness less frequently, possibly because of the time cost of entering flowers with low openness. This strategy appears adaptive because if all flowers maintain wide floral openness irrespective of their pollination demand, pollinators may visit more-pollinated flowers in an inflorescence and may leave the inflorescence without visiting less-pollinated flowers. Reduction of openness of more-pollinated flowers fits a strategy of enhancing effective pollination within inflorescences.     ",2015

The potential role of the visitors in the pollination process was defined: pollen or nectar robbers, or as primary or secondary pollinators, secondary if they visit less flowers or do so in an inefficient way. Visitor's activity was recorded for 24 consecutive hours on 5 inflorescences. The visitors were from the following groups: hawkmoths, bats, bees and hummingbirds. The peak of the activity in the 3 Agave species was registered between 21:00 to 03:00 h. In some cases, diurnal visitors (bees and hummingbirds) could also be pollinators. The primary pollinators were the nectar feeding bats Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, L. nivalis, and Choeronycteris mexicana. The most common secondary pollinator was the hawkmoth Erinnyis ello. The main pollen and nectar robber was the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, however, A. mellifera could also be considered as a secondary pollinator for A. striata, because this species has smaller flowers.",2015
The influence of nectar production and floral visitors on the female reproductive success of Inga (Fabaceae): a field experiment,Atlantic forest; bats; fruit set; hummingbirds; pollination systems; seed set; hawkmoths,POLLINATION SYSTEMS; SEED PRODUCTION; PRODUCTION DYNAMICS; SUGAR COMPOSITION; FLOWER VISITORS; FRUIT-SET; PLANT; SPECIALIZATION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS,"Floral morphology, nectar secretion strategies and the contribution of pollinators to the reproductive success of plants provide important clues regarding the levels of generalization or specialization in pollination systems. Anthesis throughout the day and night allows flowers to be visited by diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, promoting generalization or specialization. We studied three species in the diverse tropical genus Inga to: (1) quantify the response of flowers to successive nectar extractions and (2) determine the contribution of diurnal and nocturnal floral visitors to female reproductive success. Inga flowers could be clearly distinguished mainly on the basis of the staminal tube diameter and the quantities of filaments and pollen grains. Successive nectar removals led to a decrease of 60% in the total nectar secretion in I.vera and to increases of 20% in I.ingoides and 10% in I.striata. Despite these differences, the studied Inga spp. exhibited similar patterns of visitation rates and shared diurnal and nocturnal pollinators. Nocturnal pollinators contributed ten times more than diurnal pollinators to the female reproductive success of Inga. Floral morphology, nectar secretion patterns and pollination ecology data suggest an evolutionary trend towards specialization for nocturnal pollinators in Inga spp. with crepuscular or nocturnal flowers.

However, the validity of pollination syndrome has been widely doubted in modern studies of pollination ecology. The pollination ecology of five Asian Buddleja species, B.asiatica, B.crispa, B.forrestii, B.macrostachya and B.myriantha, in the Sino-Himalayan region in Asia, flowering in different local seasons, with scented inflorescences were investigated during 2011 and 2012. These five species exhibited diverse floral traits, with narrow and long corolla tubes and concealed nectar. According to their floral morphology, larger bees and Lepidoptera were expected to be the major pollinators. However, field observations showed that only larger bees (honeybee/bumblebee) were the primary pollinators, ranging from 77.95% to 97.90% of total visits. In this study, floral scents of each species were also analysed using coupled gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although the five Buddleja species emitted differentiated floral scent compositions, our results showed that floral scents of the five species are dominated by substances that can serve as attractive signals to bees, including species-specific scent compounds and principal compounds with larger relative amounts. This suggests that floral scent compositions are closely associated with the principal pollinator assemblages in these five species. Therefore, we conclude that floral scent compositions rather than floral morphology traits should be used to interpret plant-pollinator interactions in these Asian Buddleja species.",2015
Rainwater in cupulate bracts repels seed herbivores in a bumblebee-pollinated subalpine flower,Cupulate bract; floral herbivory; legitimate pollinator; nectar robber; Pedicularis rex; seed predation,MULTIFUNCTIONAL BRACTS; OROBANCHACEAE; ECOLOGY; POLLEN; WATER,"Floral herbivory may have deleterious effects on the reproductive success of flowering plants. However, plants may evolve floral traits that allow them to defend against herbivory in particular conditions. A bumblebee-pollinated subalpine herb, Pedicularis rex (Orobanchaceae), endemic to southwest China, has cup-like bracts that fill with rainwater, which submerges its corolla tubes. We hypothesized that these water-filled cupulate bracts function to deter nectar robbers and/or seed herbivores. To test these hypotheses, we experimentally drained bracts and measured both the response of mutualistic floral visitors and antagonistic nectar robbers and seed predators and their effects on seed production. Our observations revealed that neither nectar robbers nor legitimate pollinators discriminated between water-drained flowers and intact controls. However, seed predation significantly increased in drained flowers, suggesting that water-filled bracts help protect the flowers from seed herbivores. The water-filled bracts in P. rex may represent an adaptation to reduce floral herbivory in a high-rainfall environment.",2015
Breeding and Pollination Biology of Combretum constrictum (Benth) Laws. (Combretaceae),Breeding biology; Combretum; Entomophily; Ornithophily; Phenology,ECOLOGY; SYSTEM,"Combretum species possess horticultural attributes. We investigated the phenology, floral morphology, breeding and pollination biology of Combretum constrictum. Visual observation for morphology, day and night monitoring for floral visitors, pollen viability test by the lactophenol cotton blue method, and different pollination experiments were performed on the species. C. constrictum possesses terminal racemes and flowers all year round, with the peak blooming period occurring between August and November. Fruit set predominantly occurs from August to December. The average lifespan of an inflorescence, as observed in the species, is 32 days, while the lifespan of a single flower is 7-12 days. Anthesis is diurnal, proceeds centripetally and lasts approximately 5 h. The average viability of the pollen was 97.05 % on Day 1, decreasing to 11.64 % on Day 4. Visitors from ten families {Dolichoderinae, Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Muscidae, Nectariniidae, Drosophilidae, Tettigoniidae, Acrididae, Hesperiidae, Achatinidae and Myrmicinae} were encountered on flowers of the species during the study period. Five of these visitors, including Cinnyris venustus, Meranoplus bicolor, Camponotus consobrinus and Technomyrmex sp., are the main pollinators of the species. These pollinators predominantly visited the flowers for a few hours until the opening of the flower buds and continued visiting the flowers until 2 days after the opening of the last flower bud on the inflorescence. The flowers are unscented but are brilliant red-pink, suggesting that the visitors/pollinators are attracted to the flowers due to their colour. After pollination, the number of immature fruits in this species ranged from 6 to 51, and averaged 25.80. The percentage of fruit set and mature fruits per inflorescence varied from one treatment to another (self-pollinated, 2.60 +/- 1.10; hand cross-pollinated, 4.55 +/- 1.43; and visitor-pollinated, 8.75 +/- 2.65). These findings indicate that C. constrictum is self-compatible, but the presence of pollinators increases the number of fruits and probably enhances the fertility of the fruits. The species exhibits entomophily (insect pollination) and ornithophily (bird pollination) syndromes.",2015
Determination of Flower Constancy in Bombus atratus Franklin and Bombus bellicosus Smith (Hymenoptera: Apidae) through Palynological Analysis of Nectar and Corbicular Pollen Loads,Bumblebees; foraging behavior; pollination,BUMBLE-BEES; RAPHANUS-RAPHANISTRUM; WILD RADISH; EFFICIENCY; ALERT; FOOD,"The flower constancy (the visit to a single plant species during a foraging trip) in pollinator insects is a theme widely discussed in behavioral ecology and has an important implication in the evolution of angiosperms. This behavior was studied in the bumblebees Bombus atratus Franklin and Bombus bellicosus Smith through palynological analysis of the nectar and pollen loads of individuals captured while foraging in a restricted area. In both species, there were more individuals with constant flights than with non-constant ones, although in the nectar loads of B. atratus there were no significant differences between individuals with each flight types. It was verified that the nectar loads of the individuals that made either constant or non-constant flights did not differ in the number of pollen grains they contained. Considering this measurement as an estimate for flight duration, the results would indicate that the probability of changing between plant species during nectar collection is independent of the foraging trip duration. In both species, most individuals who collected nectar and/or pollen from more than one plant species visited just two plant species. In these cases, the pollen of one plant species was predominant. In the bumblebees in which it was possible to analyze nectar and pollen loads, the botanical origin of both resources was the same or they shared the principal species (with the exception of two individuals), showing that bumblebees do not often use a botanical source in an exclusive way to collect nectar and another to collect pollen.",2015

To evaluate the cascading impact of deer browsing on pollination and plant reproduction is critical to understand the roles of species interactions in maintaining plant populations and for conservation management. In this study, we investigated the relationships among floral resources of understory herbaceous plants, pollinator visitation, and fruit set of shrub species based on data accumulation over three years in six temperate deciduous forests with deer and without deer. We found that in deer browsed sites, the visitation rate of bumblebees had decreased due to severe reduction in the coverage of autumn-flowering herbaceous plants, while the effect varied between bumblebee species. On the other hand, other insect taxa showed no dependence on variation in autumn floral resources. The two genera of bumblebee-pollinated shrubs showed reduced fruit set due to severe decline in autumn-flowering herbaceous plants and bumblebee visitation (Weigela: -18.5% and Rhododendron: -21.9%). In contrast, the fruit set of shrubs pollinated by insects that did not show dependence on autumn floral resources were not negatively affected by deer browsing. Our results suggest that deer browsing have not only caused negative effects on herbaceous plants, but in addition have negative indirect effects on reproduction of woody plants through cascading effects of pollination linkages.",2015

In Southeast Asia, thrips were recently discovered to pollinate flowers of several taxonomic sections of the pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae), which is particularly well known as an ant-plant, and for its importance in early forest succession. The lack of taxonomic treatment and of knowledge about systematic relationships among extant thrips, however, has prevented firm conclusions on the specificity of this plant-pollinator interaction. Here, results from sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit support our previous morphospecies concept of Macaranga flower thrips, and confirm the genetic identity of five recently described species. They were remarkably all assigned to the genus Dolichothrips (Phlaeothripidae), which typically consists of phytophagous species. In addition, the molecular data revealed one cryptic species. A first phylogenetic tree of the Dolichothrips associated with Macaranga provides insights into their systematic position. In particular, we identify monophyly of all important Macaranga pollinator species, all species being largely specific to particular taxonomic host plant sections. Our results suggest a closely matched diversification of pollinating thrips with Macaranga trees. This adds a novel type of association to thrips pollinator-plant interactions, which have been so far documented as single-species interactions or generalist thrips species visiting multiple plant taxa.",2015

However, less attention has been paid to single plant-animal relationships such as the mechanism through which interactions with pollinators take place, which is responsible for the evolution of new mutualistic relationships and the outcome of sexual reproduction and distribution of plants. Because the majority of plant-pollinator relationships are based on food collection by pollinators, we investigated the extent of exploitation of Acacia pycnantha by Apis mellifera. A. pycnantha is native to Australia, but is invasive in many Mediterranean countries, including Italy. We investigated whether visits by the native pollinator A. mellifera to a non-native food source (A. pycnantha) were occasional, or dictated by a precise pattern matching resource availability. Showing that a native pollinator's foraging strategy has readily adapted to a potential resource offered by an invasive plant allows us to understand better the mechanisms promoting invasiveness of alien angiosperms. We collected data on pollen and nectar characteristics and variation in their availability, and conducted behavioural observations of foraging honey bees. Acacia pycnantha flower heads and extrafloral nectaries are sources of food actively selected by honey bees, which display behaviours strongly associated with resource availability. Our results showed clear evidence of a strong invasive plant-native pollinator relationship, enhancing the success of sexual reproduction of the alien species. Future studies may highlight to which extent this relationship has influenced the spread of this invasive plant.",2015

However, the insects associated with P. chinensis pollination have received scant attention. As a widespread invasive plant we would expect P. chinensis to be associated with a diverse group of insect pollinators, but lack of taxonomic identification capacity is an impediment to confirm this expectation. In the present study we aimed to elucidate the insect pollinators of P. chinensis in peninsular Malaysia using DNA barcoding. Forty flower visitors, representing the range of morphological diversity observed, were captured at flowers at Ulu Kali, Pahang, Malaysia. Using Automated Barcode Gap Discovery, 17 morphospecies were assigned to 23 species representing at least ten families and four orders. Using the DNA barcode library (BOLD) 30% of the species could be assigned a species name, and 70% could be assigned a genus name.

We investigated the relationship among pollen limitation, pollinator visitation and breeding system in salt cedar, i.e., the shrub Tamarix ramosissima (Ledeb), which is one of ecologically important species in arid regions of Northwest China. We observed insect visitations to T. ramosissima and estimated pollen limitation. T. ramosissima was pollinated by at least six native bee species, and we observed that pollinator diversity and composition of the pollinator assemblages could affect pollen limitation. Pollinator visitation differed significantly between habitat patches, but did not differ significantly between patch sizes. In general, pollen limitation appeared to be more severe in fruit set than in seed production and the patches with more pollinator visits were less pollen limited in fruit set. However, pollen limitation in seed production was not significantly correlated with pollinator visitation frequency. We concluded that pollen limitation of T. ramosissima reproduction depended on more than one factor, not just pollinator visits. We also found that out-crossing was dominant and self-pollination just played an assistant role to assure reproduction. ",2015
Both biotic and abiotic factors influence floral longevity in three species of Epidendrum (Orchidaceae),Epidendrum; flower longevity; Neotropics; orchids; pollinators,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; POLLINATION SUCCESS; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; FLOWER LONGEVITY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BREEDING SYSTEM; TROPICAL ORCHID; CLIMATE; POLLEN; PLANTS,"Extended flower longevity has been widely defended to occur as a consequence of low pollination activity. To test this hypothesis in Neotropical rainforests, we selected three species of Epidendrum that flower during rainy conditions and commonly exhibit low levels of insect visits. Experimental studies carried out in 15 populations distributed along a wide spatial gradient detected the presence of pollinator limitation in all populations. Pollinia removal without pollen deposition increased longevity, and thus extended longevity could apparently be considered as an ecological advantage for these orchids. Nevertheless, flower longevity was severely shortened by abiotic factors like precipitation and humidity. Comparison with other tropical orchids showed that flower longevity was higher even in species that flower during periods of more pollinator activity than the ones studied here, which is contrary to the hypothesis that pollinators are the only driving force for long-lived flowers in Epidendrum. Thus, although long floral longevities are apparently favorable for the reproductive success of these species, the high maintenance costs experienced during rainy conditions are also an important factor constraining the selection of long-lived flowers in Epidendrum.",2015

Phenotypically generalized flowers are typically also considered to be generalized ecologically and/or functionally. Our study focuses on visitors to flowers of Hypericum roeperianum and H. revolutum, two closely related co-flowering Afromontane plants with flat flowers, which can be visited by many insects. We collected insect visitors and recorded their behaviour. Both Hypericum species were visited by large numbers of morphospecies and functional groups, which might indicate that they are highly generalized plants. Nevertheless, after including the visitors' abundance, behaviour and contact with the plants' reproductive organs, only a single carpenter bee species could be considered an effective pollinator of H. roeperianum, and a few smaller bee species (mainly Apis mellifera and Meliplebeia ogouensis) could be considered as effective pollinators of H. revolutum. Despite the fact that the flowers appear at first glance phenotypically generalized, both species seem to be ecologically and functionally specialized for bee pollination. Our results indicate that even phenotypically generalized flowers can be functionally and ecologically specialized. More precise knowledge of their visitors' behaviour is crucial for understanding their pollination systems. Our results cast doubts upon the currently leading opinion that generalization prevails in pollination systems, as such conclusions are based mainly on community-wide studies, which usually do not consider the true role of insect visitors.",2015

To select plants with higher flowering rate and fruit production, we investigated the following characteristics of A. venetum in wild and managed populations: flowering dynamics, pollen viability, pollen limitation, floral visitors and breeding system. We found that the species showed four reproductive characteristics. First, the flower production period and flowering peak were different between the wild and managed populations, longer in the managed. Second, A. venetum was pollen-limited, and pollen limitation was more intense in the wild population than in the managed. Third, in the wild, Apis mellifera L. was found to be frequent pollinator, Ophion luteus L. being the most frequent and effective visitor in the managed. Finally, the pollen ovule rate was 36.2. Self-pollination was dominant and played an important role to assure production in the breeding system.

These include growing ornamental plant varieties attractive to flower-visiting insects. Because varieties vary greatly in attractiveness, there is a need to quantify it in order to give objective advice to gardeners. Here, we used the British national collection of asters to compare the attractiveness of varieties to flower-visiting insects. We counted and identified insects as they foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We also scored attributes relevant to gardening: attractiveness to humans, ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects, ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed, with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and 64% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects. These results imply that choosing varieties carefully is likely to be of conservation benefit to flower-visiting insects, and that doing so is a no-cost option in terms of garden beauty and workload.",2015
Multitasking in a plant-ant interaction: how does Acacia myrtifolia manage both ants and pollinators?,Conflict; Exclusion experiment; Extrafloral nectaries; Fruit set; Pollination,EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; BREEDING SYSTEM; MIMOSOIDEAE; LEGUMINOSAE; CLASSIFICATION; MUTUALISM; PHYLOGENY; RETINODES; CONFLICT; FLOWERS,"Plant associations with protective ants are widespread among angiosperms, but carry the risk that ants will deter pollinators as well as herbivores. Such conflict, and adaptations to ameliorate or prevent the conflict, have been documented in African and neotropical acacias. Ant-acacia associations occur in Australia, but little is known of their ecology. Moreover, recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that Australian acacias are only distantly related to African and American acacias, providing an intercontinental natural experiment in the management of ant-pollinator conflict. We examined four populations of Acacia myrtifolia over a 400-km environmental gradient in southeastern Australia using ant and pollinator exclusion as well as direct observation of ants and pollinators to assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict to affect seed set. Native bees were the only group of floral visitors whose visitation rates were a significant predictor of fruiting success, although beetles and wasps may play an important role as ""insurance"" pollinators. We found no increase in pollinator visitation or fruiting success following ant exclusion, even with large sample sizes and effective exclusion. Because ants are facultative visitors to A. myrtifolia plants, their presence may be insufficient to interfere greatly with floral visitors. It is also likely that the morphological location of extrafloral nectaries tends to draw ants away from reproductive parts, although we commonly observed ants on inflorescences, so the spatial separation is not strict. A. myrtifolia appears to maintain a generalized mutualism over a wide geographic range without the need for elaborate adaptations to resolve ant-pollinator conflict.",2015
Pollination ecology of three sympatric species of Oenocarpus (Arecaceae) in the Colombian Amazon,Coleoptera; fruitset; mutualism; tropical palms; reproductive biology,FLORAL SCENT CHEMISTRY; GEONOMA-MACROSTACHYS; PALMS ARECACEAE; RAIN-FOREST; BACTRIS; CURCULIONIDAE; COLEOPTERA,"The understanding of pollination mechanisms is vital for developing management and conservation actions of economically important species. In order to understand the pollination mechanisms of the promising palms in the genus Oenocarpus (Arecaceae), we studied floral morphology and biology, of three sympatric species in the Colombian Amazon: O. bataua, O. balickii and O. minor. During the period 2010-2012 we made direct and continuous observations of inflorescences (visitors, pollinators, and reproductive success) of the three species in every development phase. We determined the association of the palms with their floral visitors through a complex or interaction network, whereas specificity or preference of the insects for each individual palm was assessed through paired similarity analysis, similarity analysis (ANOSIM), and ordering analysis based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMSD). The three species flowered throughout the year; their inflorescences have long rachillae that hang close to each other from a short rachis, and they bear flowers in dyads or triads. Inflorescences are protandrous, thermogenic; anthesis takes place during daytime but pollination is nocturnal. We recorded 79 species of insects, mainly beetles, 33 of which visited O. balickii, 63. visited O. bataua, and 33 visited O. minor. Although they shared some visitors, their abundance during the pistillate phase, as well as their pollen loads showed that only a few species of Curculionidae and Nitidulidae are the principal pollinators of the three studied species. Differences in network structure between staminate and pistillate phases, as well as difference in abundance found with the ANOSIM and NMSD similarity tests, suggest a high specificity of pollinators, leading to reproductive isolation among the three species. Because all pollinating beetles were found to develop their life cycles within the inflorescences, we hypothesize the occurrence of a specialized system of mutual dependence between each of this three Oenocarpus species and their pollinators. This specialization assures a year-round availability of the pollinators.",2015

AURICULA PRIMULACEAE; FLORAL LONGEVITY; STIGMATIC RECEPTIVITY; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; POLLEN VIABILITY; TEMPERATURE; CLASSIFICATION; PLEISTOCENE; LIMITATION,"Under the pressure of global warming, general expectations of species migration and evolution of adaptive traits should always be confirmed with species-specific studies. Within this framework, some species can be used as study systems to predict possible consequences of global warming also on other relatives. Unlike its mountain congeneric, Primula palinuri Petagn. has endured all the climatic fluctuations since the Pleistocene, while surviving on Mediterranean coastal cliffs. The aim of this work was to investigate the possible evolution of reproductive biological and ecological traits in P.palinuri adaptation to a warmer environment. Data showed that flowering starts in mid-winter; single flowers remain open for over a month, changing from pendulous to erect. The number of insects visiting flowers of P.palinuri increases during the flowering season, and pollination reduces flower longevity. Overall, the best pollen performances, in terms of viability and germinability, occur at winter temperatures, while pollinator activity prolongs flowering until spring. Moreover, extended longevity of single flowers optimises reproductive success. Both phenotypic plasticity and selective processes might have occurred in P.palinuri. However, we found that reproductive traits of the only Mediterranean Primula remain more associated with cold mountain habitats than warm coastal cliffs. Given the rapid trend of climate warming, migration and new adaptive processes in P.palinuri are unlikely. Response to past climate warming of P.palinuri provides useful indications for future scenarios in other Primula species.",2015

We radio-tracked 17 individuals for five to 19 nights over a three month period. The bats were from three cave colonies in agricultural habitats in southern Thailand. They traveled between one and 17.9 km ((x) over bar +/- SD: 4.4 km +/- 5.07, median = 2.34) from their roosting cave to food sources. The mean home-range size of the individuals varied with the method used in its calculation from 518.4 ha (100% Minimum Convex Polygon, MCP) to 564.5 ha (100% Local Convex Hull method, LoCoH) and 460.8 ha (95% Kernel density estimation, KDE). The mean size of foraging areas used by the bats also varied according to the method of calculation from 14.26 ha (100% MCP), 13.25 ha (100% LoCoH) and 38.52 ha (95% KDE) and accounted for 21.9%, 20.08% and 40.5% of the respective home-range size. The bats foraged in one to three foraging areas each night. The greatest distance between feeding trees varied between 0.25 and 8 km (mean 1.25 km +/- 2.19). Those bats with multiple foraging areas moved from patch to patch of Durio zibethinus and did not return to a previously visited patch, whereas those feeding on Parkia repeated their visits to several patches in a single night. Ninety percent of foraging areas used by the radio-tagged individuals were in managed habitat such as fruit orchards and yards of houses to which the bats maintained strong site fidelity.",2015
Self-compatibility and floral traits adapted for self-pollination allow homostylous Nymphoides geminata (Menyanthaceae) to persist in marginal habitats,Autonomous self-pollination; Herkogamy; Ploidy; Stylar polymorphism,BREEDING SYSTEMS; VILLARSIA MENYANTHACEAE; INCOMPATIBILITY SYSTEMS; DAMNACANTHUS RUBIACEAE; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; AMSINCKIA BORAGINACEAE; MONTANA MENYANTHACEAE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; STYLAR POLYMORPHISM; FLOWERING PLANTS,"Many stylar polymorphic plants are equipped with reciprocal herkogamy and incompatibility systems so that each floral morph within a population can only mate with the compatible reciprocal morph. In the ecological or geographical margins of the range of stylar polymorphic taxa, homostyly may evolve in response to a lack of mate and/or poor pollinator visitation. This prediction is tested here by comparing floral traits, seed production without pollinators (i.e. autonomously), pollinator activity and ploidy level between the homostylous Nymphoides geminata that colonise geographically marginal habitats and its stylar polymorphic and self-incompatible closely related species N. montana that typically occur in natural water bodies in south-eastern Australia. Autonomous self-fertilisation is detected in glasshouse. Homostyly in N. geminata is also associated with floral adaptation to autonomous self-pollen deposition. There is a reduction in size and attractiveness of homostylous floral organs: over 80 % shorter stigma-anther separations and lower pollen: ovule ratio than the polymorphic flowers. The SEM images reveal that homostylous flowers possess similar pollen and stigma papillae morphology to those of short styles and long styles of the polymorphic flowers, respectively. Nymphoides geminata may be an example of recombinant homostyly: combining the pollen compatibility features of one morph with the stylar compatibility features of the reciprocal morph. Results of floral visitor observations and open pollinations indicate the ability of homostylous plants to reproduce successfully despite pollinator scarcity. Somatic chromosome counts indicate a possible lack of relationship between ploidy level and sexual system. Homostylous condition should provide an opportunity for reproductive assurance in environments with unreliable pollinators.",2015
THE INFLUENCE OF NATURAL VARIATION IN POPULATION SIZE ON ECOLOGICAL AND QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF THE ENDANGERED ENDEMIC PLANT HYPERICUM CUMULICOLA,adaptive potential; adaptive constraint; extinction; Allee effect; pollinator limitation; mating system evolution,CERATIOLA-ERICOIDES EMPETRACEAE; FLORIDA SCRUB; BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; ROSEMARY SCRUB; DEMOGRAPHY; FIRE; DIFFERENTIATION; RARE,"Premise of research. Genetic variation for ecologically important traits is necessary for populations to adapt to environmental change. Many authors have called for a greater emphasis on directly measuring quantitative genetic variation in rare species, which are expected to have reduced amounts of genetic variation due to genetic drift in small populations. The extent of among-population differentiation for quantitative traits may also help to evaluate the likelihood that genetic rescue/translocation will be a successful conservation strategy. Despite these merits, relatively few studies measure quantitative genetic variation for ecologically important traits as a function of population size. Methodology. Sixteen populations of the endangered plant Hypericum cumulicola were sampled, capitalizing on previous work that has estimated relative effective population sizes and demonstrated minimal migration between populations. This context allows more direct inference about the role of drift in small populations on quantitative genetic variation, the focus of this study. Using controlled pollinations and a greenhouse common garden, quantitative genetic variation within populations and differentiation among populations were estimated for six putatively ecologically important traits. Pivotal results. There were few significant estimates of genetic variation for most traits irrespective of population size. There was a positive correlation between population size and genetic variation for anther-stigma distance, a floral trait expected to influence the degree of self-fertilization. There was also limited differentiation among populations for all traits. Conclusions. Limited genetic variation for ecologically important traits in these populations could slow or limit adaptive responses to future environmental change, possibly increasing extinction risk. The smallest populations will be particularly sensitive to environmental/habitat changes that result in reduced pollinator visitation. Limited phenotypic differentiation, combined with previous evidence of strong heterosis in crosses between small populations, suggests little risk of outbreeding depression if genetic rescue efforts become necessary to preserve this species.",2015
Floral traits driving reproductive isolation of two co-flowering taxa that share vertebrate pollinators,Bats; chiropterophily; generalized and specialized systems; hummingbirds; Ipomoea; pollinator sharing; Trochilidae,INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER; NECTAR PRODUCTION; BATS; HUMMINGBIRDS; CONVOLVULACEAE; SPECIALIZATION; BURMEISTERA; CAMPANULACEAE; CONSEQUENCES; PATTERNS,"pollinators Floral attributes evolve in response to frequent and efficient pollinators, which are potentially important drivers of floral diversification and reproductive isolation. In this context, we asked, how do flowers evolve in a bathummingbird pollination system? Hence, we investigated the pollination ecology of two co-flowering Ipomoea taxa (I. marcellia and I. aff. marcellia) pollinated by bats and hummingbirds, and factors favouring reproductive isolation and pollinator sharing in these plants. To identify the most important drivers of reproductive isolation, we compared the flowers of the two Ipomoea taxa in terms of morphometry, anthesis and nectar production. Pollinator services were assessed using frequency of visits, fruit set and the number of seeds per fruit after visits. The studied Ipomoea taxa differed in corolla size and width, beginning and duration of anthesis, and nectar attributes. However, they shared the same diurnal and nocturnal visitors. The hummingbird Heliomaster squamosus was more frequent in I. marcellia (1.90 visits h(-1)) than in I. aff. marcellia (0.57 visits h(-1)), whereas glossophagine bats showed similar visit rates in both taxa (I. marcellia: 0.57 visits h 21 and I. aff. marcellia: 0.64 visits h(-1)). Bat pollination was more efficient in I. aff. marcellia, whereas pollination by hummingbirds was more efficient in I. marcellia. Differences in floral attributes between Ipomoea taxa, especially related to the anthesis period, length of floral parts and floral arrangement in the inflorescence, favour reproductive isolation from congeners through differential pollen placement on pollinators. This bathummingbird pollination system seems to be advantageous in the study area, where the availability of pollinators and floral resources changes considerably throughout the year, mainly as a result of rainfall seasonality. This interaction is beneficial for both sides, as it maximizes the number of potential pollen vectors for plants and resource availability for pollinators.",2015

However, the fruits of this species has been under an unsustainable extraction and there is a growing interest of establishing this species as a crop; nevertheless, the information about its breeding system is scarce, which is essential for its sustainable management and conservation. This research aimed to study the floral and reproductive biology of V. meridionale in natural conditions, and to analyze the importance of pollinators on its reproduction, in two wild populations of V meridionale in the states of Cundinamarca and Boyaca, in the Oriental Cordillera of Colombia. For this, we have made different observations and experiments to describe its flower morphology, floral phenology, pollen viability, stigma receptivity, pollen-ovule ratio and nectar production. To study its reproductive system, we performed experiments of flower emasculation, pollinator exclusion and hand pollination (self-and cross-pollination). We found that although the flowers have poricidal anthers, the release of pollen could occur easily without vibration. V meridionale shows a large floral display, long floral longevity and has female-biased nectar production. The pollen-ovule ratio was of 571 133, which classified the species as facultative xenogamy. This result agreed with the pollination experiments because the plants produced fruits by agamospermy, selfing and outcrossing. However, we registered a strong inbreeding depression, observed in high rates of fruit abortions, after self-pollination. Unlike of self-pollinating fruits, the plant retains those produced by cross-pollination since its formation. The floral traits showed by this species are mechanisms to favor a more diverse guild of floral visitors than only insects able to buzz-pollination. In addition, these floral traits may enhance the pollination probability, and reduce geitonogamy. Moreover, the inbreeding depression suggests that V meridionale promotes outcrossing as its main reproductive strategy. Therefore, pollinators, particularly bees, are essential for this species reproduction and conservation, and are critical in the maintenance of its genetic variability and fruits production.",2015

The interaction between plants and pollinators is of particular interest given the potential current global decline in pollinators. Reduced pollinator services can be compensated for in some plant species by self-pollination. However, if inbreeding depression is high, selfed progeny could die prior to reaching adulthood, leading to cryptic recruitment failure. Methods To examine this scenario, pollinator abundance, pollen limitation, selfing rates and inbreeding depression were examined in 12 populations of varying disturbance levels in Sophora microphylla (Fabaceae), an endemic New Zealand tree species. Key Results High pollen limitation was found in all populations (average of 58 % reduction in seed production, nine populations), together with high selfing rates (61 % of offspring selfed, six populations) and high inbreeding depression (selfed offspring 86 % less fit, six populations). Pollen limitation was associated with lower visitation rates by the two endemic bird pollinators. Conclusions The results suggest that for these populations, over half of the seeds produced are genetically doomed. This reduction in the fitness of progeny due to reduced pollinator service is probably important to population dynamics of other New Zealand species. More broadly, the results suggest that measures of seed production or seedling densities may be a gross overestimate of the effective offspring production. This could lead to cryptic recruitment failure, i.e. a decline in successful reproduction despite high progeny production. Given the global extent of pollinator declines, cryptic recruitment failure may be widespread.",2015

In order to understand the pollination system of Z. xanthoxylum, we investigated the following characteristics of this species in the Urat Desert-grassland Research Station in western Inner Mongolia of China: flowering dynamics, pollen viability, pollen limitation, floral visitors and breeding system. The results showed that the flowering period and flowering peak were different between the wild and managed populations, being longer in the managed population. Z. xanthoxylum was pollen-limited, and pollen limitation was more intense in the wild population than in the managed population. Chalicodoma deserticola (Hymenoptera) was found to be the most frequent pollinator in the wild population, while Anthophora fulvitarsis (Hymenoptera) was the most frequent and effective visitor in the managed population. Out-crossing was dominant in the breeding system and self-pollination just played an assistant role to assure the reproduction of Z. xanthoxylum.",2015

However, ultimately, inflorescence size is determined by the balance between the benefits of large inflorescences and the increased cost of geitonogamy. At present, little is known about the relationship between inflorescence size and fecundity in deceptive plants. Given that pollinators are likely to leave inflorescences lacking rewards quickly, it seems unlikely that longer pollinator visits and the risk of geitonogamy would be strong selective pressures in these species, which indicates that pollinator attraction might be the most important factor influencing their inflorescence size. Here we examined the pollination ecology of the deceptive orchid Cephalanthera falcata in order to clarify the effects of inflorescence size on the fruit set of this non-rewarding species. Field observations of the floral visitors showed that C. falcata is pollinated by the andrenid bee Andrena aburana, whilst pollination experiments demonstrated that this orchid species is neither autogamous nor apogamous, but is strongly pollinator dependent. Three consecutive years of field observations revealed that fruit set was positively correlated with the number of flowers per inflorescence. These results provide strong evidence that the nectarless orchid C. falcata benefits from producing larger inflorescences that attract a greater number of innate pollinators. Large inflorescences may have a greater positive effect on fruit set in deceptive plants because a growing number of studies suggest that fruit set in reward-producing plants is usually unaffected by display size.",2015

Thus, the mutualism between flowering plants and their pollinators is a keystone ecological relationship in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Though plant-pollinator interactions have received considerable amount of attention, there are still many unanswered questions. In this paper, we use methods of evolutionary game theory to investigate the co-evolution of floral advertisement and pollinator preferences. Our results indicate that competition for pollination services among plant species can in some cases lead to specialization of the pollinator population to a single plant species (oligolecty). However, collecting pollen from multiple plants - at least at the population level - is evolutionarily stable under a wider parameter range. Finally, we show that, in the presence of pollinators, plants that optimize their investment in attracting vs. rewarding visiting pollinators outcompete plants that do not. ",2015

Thus, a literature review was conducted to aim of compiling information on the pollination and reproductive system in species of Acanthaceae Juss. in Brazil. A total of 30 studies, count 31 species, were part of this review. Regarding geographical distribution of studies, the Southeast Brazil (50%) and Atlantic Forest biome (56.7%) had the higher proportion of studies. Four pollination syndromes were recorded: trochilophily, melittophily, psycophily, and chiropterophily, in which trochilophily was predominant (79.31% of species). Consequently, hummingbirds were the most common flower visitors, interacting with 86.2% of the species, and Phaethornis pretrei was the main hummingbird visitor. Other groups of visitors were also recorded, such as bees (second main group, 34.5%), butterflies, bats, moths, wasps, flies and beetles. From the 17 species studied in Brazil about the reproductive system, all have androgynous flowers and 16 species (94.1%) selfcompatibility. Intrinsic factors such as herkogamy and dichogamy were common in species of Acanthaceae, constituting mechanisms that minimize interference between male and female functions in androgynous flowers and maximize cross-pollination. Approximately 41.2% of species presented spontaneous self-pollination, i. e. production of fruits without the need of pollinators. Reproductive strategies such as cleistogamy and agamospermy were also recorded in species of Acanthaceae in Brazil. However, more studies on the pollination and reproductive system with species of Acanthaceae in Brazil need to be developed to expand the sampling and then support better the estimates of this review.",2015

We tested whether the visitation rate of potential pollinators is associated with the amount of seeds per fruit produced by the self-compatible bromeliad Tillandsia stricta (Bromeliaceae). We determined whether hummingbirds are legitimate visitors by testing for a correlation between visits and pollination (seed production) at the Guapiacu Ecological Reserve (Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu), state of Rio de Janeiro. We tested 30 flowers, five of which were also monitored to test the possibility of spontaneous self-pollination. The remaining 25 flowers were exposed to floral visitors. Twenty-two flowers formed fruits and seeds, from which three formed seeds without floral visits. The hummingbird Amazilia fimbriata (Gmelin, 1788) was the only legitimate visitor. The average number (+/- standard deviation) of seeds was 27 units (+/- 15) per fruit. The floral visitation rate by A. fimbriata was 6.6 (+/- 3.4) visits/per flower. The number of floral visits and the amount of seed produced were positively correlated (r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.01). Thus, A. fimbriata is a legitimate floral visitor of T. stricta, and influences seed production per fruit in this bromeliad.",2015

The aim of this study is to elucidate the reproductive strategies of this heterostylous species in an alpine environment Methods - Floral scents were assessed and the pollinator assemblage and their foraging behaviour were recorded. In addition, the breeding system was investigated during 2004 and 2005 in populations from the Yulong Shan range, Lijiang County of Yunnan Province, China. Key results - Limonene was the dominant floral scent compound, accounting for 41.2%, followed by a-pinene, diacetone alcohol and myrcene. Higher fruit and seed sets from inter-morph pollination were found compared to self, intra-morph and geitogamous pollination. Significant differences in seed set after self and open pollination were detected between flower morphs in both years. Two common insect species, the bumblebee Bombus lucorum and the butterfly Hypolimnas misippus, were the most important pollinators in the examined population, they visited the inflorescences 3.3 and 2.3 times per hour, respectively. Conclusion - beesiana is an obligate outcrosser, but with some self-compatibility. Seed set of self-pollinated pins was higher than that of thrums in both years, which seems to be related to this partial self-compatibility, which is often ignored in distylous Primula species. Floral scent and petal colour provide signals for pollinator attraction, and visitation rates are high.",2015
"Hummingbird-flower interaction in three remnants of tropical dry forest (TdF) in the municipality of Chimichagua (Cesar, Colombia)",Hummingbird; polinization; ecological interactions; tropical dry forest,ORGANIZATION; RESOURCES; COMMUNITY; BIRDS,"Based on the floral visits and palynological analyzes, we characterized the hummingbird-plant interaction in three tropical dry forest remnants (BsT) located in the municipality of Chimichagua (Cesar, Colombia). We used mist nets to capture hummingbirds and binoculars for observations. The flowering time and number of flowers produced by the plants visited by hummingbirds, as well as data on the quantity and quality of nectar were recorded. The sampling period (five months) covered climate variability in the study area. Two species of hummingbirds, Lepidopyga goudoti and Phaethornis anthophilus, visited 31 plant species. Arrabidaea cf. corallina, which is present in the three forests patches, was the most important resource (IVIR = 0.14840) followed by Aphelandra pulcherrima (IVIR = 0.05356) and Pogonopus speciosus (IVIR = 0.02773). Another important species with low value was Cochlospermum vitifolium. According to the analysis of pollen loads, the most important resource was Pogonopus speciosus (IVIR = 0.29643), followed by Aphelandra pulcherrima (IVIR = 0.09286) and Hemistylus cf. odontophylla (IVIR = 0.03294). In the overall analysis for the three sites, the most important resources for hummingbirds were Pogonopus speciosus (IVIR = 0.06207), Aphelandra pulcherrima (IVIR = 0.06021) and Cochlospermum vitifolium (IVIR = 0.01095). Lepidopyga goudoti used 22 plant species while P. anthophilus used only seven. The flowers visited by hummingbirds were mostly tubular with bright contrasting colors, such as red, purple, and violet, and their sizes and lengths matched the hummingbirds' bill.

Floral Visitors and Pollinators of Sesame (Sesamum indicum L) from Kichi Forest to the Adjacent Local Communities' Farms,Floral Visitors; Pollinators; Kichi Forest; Sesame; Local communities,,"Sustainable supply of forest ecosystem services by many tropical habitats including Kichi forest reserve and the associated agro-ecologies is threatened by the ongoing high extent of degradation due to deforestation, incidences of bush fires, illegal lumbering as well as poor agricultural practices Less is known on the impact of anthropogenic activities on the net flow of ecosystem offered by Kichi forest reserve. Pollination services to most crops including Sesame (Sesamum indicum L) represents one of the potential ecosystem service among farming communities neighboring the forest reserve. Sesame farming is an increasing economic venture to local communities surrounding the forest. If the forest is not conserved, it is anticipated to disappear in near future. One way of conserving this forest, is to realize its benefits to the local communities such as pollination services to their sesame crop. A study was carried out to identify the pollinators of the sesame crop from the Kichi forest. Direct observation, time constrained sampling, photographing, satellite images were used in sampling the floral visitors and pollinators in the three randomly selected farms. Potential pollinators were Apis mellifera L; Apidae (31.92%), (Nectariniidae) (23.69%) and Xylocopa caffra L; Apidae (8.73%). There was no differences in terms of diversity and abundances of floral visitors and probers for the three farms (P>0.05). Also the relationship between the floral visitors and probers was positively correlated (P<0.05). In addition, time spent to the flowers by the floral visitors and number of flowers probed were positively correlated (P<0.05). The findings concluded that, the chance of sesame flowers to be visited by the pollinators from Kichi forest was equal. The conservation of Kichi forest is essential for donating pollinators to the Sesame and other crops grown by local communities around the forest.",2015

We studied the relationship between bract motility, floral structural specialization and pollination in Dalechampia aff. bernieri, an endemic Madagascan species with floral structures indicating specialized buzz-pollination. We measured circadian bract angles in 47 inflorescences from 11 plants of D. aff. bernieri; in addition, we recorded any flower-visiting insects observed. The inflorescences had motile bracts with mean angles varying from similar to 50 degrees at 00h00 to similar to 90 degrees at 10h45. They were visited by buzz-pollinating Nomia viridilimbata bees (Halictidae), but also by non-buzz-pollinating Liotrigona bees (Apidae). The temporal pattern of bract motility observed in D. aff. bernieri may represent an extra-floral specialization to reduce visitation by non-pollinating visitors while maximizing visitation by diurnal buzz-pollinating bees.",2015

The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.",2015
A 'Landscape physiology' approach for assessing bee health highlights the benefits of floral landscape enrichment and semi-natural habitats,,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; WORKER HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; COLONY GROWTH; LAND-USE; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; CHANGING LANDSCAPES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; POLLINATORS,"Understanding how anthropogenic landscape alteration affects populations of ecologically-and economically-important insect pollinators has never been more pressing. In this context, the assessment of landscape quality typically relies on spatial distribution studies, but, whether habitat-restoration techniques actually improve the health of targeted pollinator populations remains obscure. This gap could be filled by a comprehensive understanding of how gradients of landscape quality influence pollinator physiology. We therefore used this approach for honey bees (Apis mellifera) to test whether landscape patterns can shape bee health. We focused on the pre-wintering period since abnormally high winter colony losses have often been observed. By exposing colonies to different landscapes, enriched in melliferous catch crops and surrounded by semi-natural habitats, we found that bee physiology (i.e. fat body mass and level of vitellogenin) was significantly improved by the presence of flowering catch crops. Catch crop presence was associated with a significant increase in pollen diet diversity. The influence of semi-natural habitats on bee health was even stronger. Vitellogenin level was in turn significantly linked to higher overwintering survival. Therefore, our experimental study, combining landscape ecology and bee physiology, offers an exciting proof-of-concept for directly identifying stressful or suitable landscapes and promoting efficient pollinator conservation.",2017

Phytotechnologies using plants and their associated microbes can address both of these problems. To prevent Se toxicity due to excess environmental Se, plants may be used to phytoremediate Se from soil or water. To alleviate Se deficiency in humans or livestock, crops may be biofortified with Se. These two technologies may also be combined: Se-enriched plant material from phytoremediation could be used as green fertilizer or as fortified food. Plants may also be used to ""mine"" Se from seleniferous soils. The efficiency of Se phytoremediation and biofortification may be further optimized. Research in the past decades has provided a wealth of knowledge regarding the mechanisms by which plants take up, metabolize, accumulate, and volatilize Se and the role plant-associated microbes play in these processes. Furthermore, ecological studies have revealed important effects of plant Se on interactions with herbivores, detrivores, pollinators, neighboring vegetation, and the plant microbiome. All this knowledge can be exploited in phytotechnology programs to optimize plant Se accumulation, transformation, volatilization, and/or tolerance via plant breeding, genetic engineering, and tailored agronomic practices.",2017

Th is morphological complexity may also be understood by observing their glands. Asclepiads have several protective and nuptial secretory structures. Their highly specific and specialized pollination systems are associated with the great diversity of glands found in their flowers. Th is review gathers data regarding all types of floral glands described for asclepiads and adds three new types (glandular trichome, secretory idioblast and obturator), for a total of 13 types of glands.

Orchids are a key element of the Andean flora, and one of the most prominent components of the Neotropical epiphyte diversity, yet very little is known about their origin and diversification. We address this knowledge gap by inferring the biogeographical history and diversification dynamics of the two largest Neotropical orchid groups (Cymbidieae and Pleurothallidinae), using two unparalleled, densely sampled orchid phylogenies (including more than 400 newly generated DNA sequences), comparative phylogenetic methods, geological and biological datasets. We find that the majority of Andean orchid lineages only originated in the last 20-15 million yr. Andean lineages are derived from lowland Amazonian ancestors, with additional contributions from Central America and the Antilles. Species diversification is correlated with Andean orogeny, and multiple migrations and recolonizations across the Andes indicate that mountains do not constrain orchid dispersal over long timescales. Our study sheds new light on the timing and geography of a major Neotropical diversification, and suggests that mountain uplift promotes species diversification across all elevational zones.",2017

These include ecosystem services such as local climate modification, pollination, and providing a pleasant location for socialising. The biodiversity of flora underpins many of these ecosystem services. The aims of this study are to assess the spontaneous vascular flora of urban allotment gardens and derive estimates of the species richness and diversity. In doing so, the specific position of allotment gardens within urban green infrastructure will be revealed and the role of allotment users in shaping local biodiversity determined. 358 species of spontaneous flora were recorded in 11 representative allotment garden estates (total area 150 ha) in PoznaA"", Poland. Fourteen biodiversity features were taken into account. The investigated areas exhibited high plant species richness, high diversity, low synanthropisation level, and contained valuable geobotanical elements, including plants of key importance for the European Community. For these reasons, allotment gardens should be considered as biodiversity hotspots for native species within urban green infrastructure. Based on an analysis of the spatial and functional organization of 110 individual plots, four types of usage, and corresponding plant diversity have been distinguished. The composition of the flora depends mostly on spatial and functional organization of allotment gardens and, to a much lesser extent, on the habitat conditions, which on individual plots varied very little. The high species richness and diversity in allotment gardens has important consequences for urban planning.",2017

Studies on the robustness of ecological communities suggest that the loss or reduction in abundance of individual species can lead to secondary and cascading extinctions. However, most such studies have been simulation-based analyses of the effect of primary extinction on food web structure. 2. In a field experiment we tested the direct and indirect effects of reducing the abundance of a common species, focusing on the diverse and self-contained assemblage of arthropods associated with an abundant Brazilian shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae). 3. Over a 5-month period we experimentally reduced the abundance of Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae), the commonest galling species associated with B. dracunculifolia, in 15 replicate plots paired with 15 control plots. We investigated direct effects of the manipulation on parasitoids attacking B. dracunculifoliae, as well as indirect effects (mediated via a third species or through the environment) on 10 other galler species and 50 associated parasitoid species. 4. The experimental manipulation significantly increased parasitism on B. dracunculifoliae in the treatment plots, but did not significantly alter either the species richness or abundance of other galler species. Compared to control plots, food webs in manipulated plots had significantly lower values of weighted connectance, interaction evenness and robustness (measured as simulated tolerance to secondary extinction), even when B. dracunculifoliae was excluded from calculations. 5. Parasitoid species were almost entirely specialized to individual galler species, so the observed effects of the manipulation on food web structure could not have propagated via the documented trophic links. Instead, they must have spread either through trophic links not included in the webs (e.g. shared predators) or non-trophically (e.g. through changes in habitat availability). Our results highlight that the inclusion of both trophic and non-trophic direct and indirect interactions is essential to understand the structure and dynamics of even apparently discrete ecological communities.",2017
Pollination Syndromes of Chinese Gesneriaceae: a Comparative Study between Hainan Island and Neighboring Regions,Hainan Island; Endemic species; Speciation; Floral syndromes; Pollination system; Adaptive evolution,MIRROR-IMAGE FLOWERS; FLORAL ECOLOGY; BIODIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; PLANT; SPECIALIZATION; SOFTWARE; COROLLA; BIOLOGY; ORIGIN,"The species-rich Gesneriaceae are typically a tropical family in Asia, showing a monophyletic radiation and high endemism in Southwest China and Hainan Island. The Chinese species have diverse floral traits and pollination systems, but the detailed patterns of diversity and possible differentiations between Hainan Island and the Chinese mainland remain unclear. Here, we enumerate the species diversity and proportion of endemics of Gesneriaceae for Hainan Island and the nearby Chinese provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Guangdong. We then investigate the species evolutionary histories and main floral traits to evaluate speciation and pollination syndromes for the island and mainland flora. We recognize 24 (eight endemic) species on Hainan Island, 236 (106 endemic) in Yunnan, 211 (120 endemic) in Guangxi, 97 (28 endemic) in Guizhou, and 60 (20 endemic) in Guangdong. Although Hainan Island harbors fewer species than nearby regions, probably due to its smaller area, its endemic ratio is high, only slightly lower than Guangxi. A phylogenetic tree based on nuclear ITS 1/2 and chloroplast Trn L-F indicated most Hainan-endemic species were genetically close to species from Southeast Asia, rather than mainland China. For most floral traits, e.g., growth form, corolla type and color, Hainan Island species show no differences from other regions. Hainan Island and Yunnan Province have equal proportions of species with four or two stamens, whereas most species in other regions have two stamens. Hainan Island has a much higher percentage (21%) of actinomorphic species than other regions (< 10%). Most species in Hainan Island have exserted stamens, while stamens are included in most species in other regions. We did not find any increased tendency in floral traits that promote selfing for the island flora. Generalist pollination mechanisms, supported by characters such as actinomorphic corolla, appear to provide sufficient reproductive assurance in pollinator-depauperate Hainan Island.",2017

Ecological networks provide a valuable tool to explore such impacts at the community level, and can be particularly insightful for planning and monitoring biocontrol programmes, including the potential for their seldom evaluated indirect non-target effects. Acacia longifolia is among the worst invasive species in Portugal, and has been recently targeted for biocontrol by a highly specific gall-wasp. Here we use an ambitious replicated network approach to: (1) identify the mechanisms by which direct and indirect impacts of A. longifolia can cascade from plants to higher trophic levels, including gallers, their parasitoids and inquilines; (2) reveal the structure of the interaction networks between plants, gallers, parasitoids and inquilines before the biocontrol; and (3) explore the potential for indirect interactions among gallers, including those established with the biocontrol agent, via apparent competition. Over a 15-month period, we collected 31,737 galls from native plants and identified all emerging insects, quantifying the interactions between 219 plant-, 49 galler-, 65 parasitoid-and 87 inquiline-species-one of the largest ecological networks to date. No galls were found on any of the 16 alien plant species. Invasion by A. longifolia caused an alarming simplification of plant communities, with cascading effects to higher trophic levels, namely: a decline of overall gall biomass, and on the richness, abundance and biomass of galler insects, their parasitoids, and inquilines. Correspondingly, we detected a significant decline in the richness of interactions between plants and galls. The invasion tended to increase overall interaction evenness by promoting the local extinction of the native plants that sustained more gall species. However, highly idiosyncratic responses hindered the detection of further consistent changes in network topology. Predictions of indirect effects of the biocontrol on native gallers via apparent competition ranged from negligible to highly significant. Such scenarios are incredibly hard to predict, but even if there are risks of indirect effects it is critical to weigh them carefully against the consequences of inaction and invasive species spread.",2017

However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.",2017

Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.",2017

The ongoing biodiversity crisis entails the concomitant loss of species and the ecological services they provide. Global defaunation, and particularly the loss of frugivores, may negatively affect the seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plant species, with predictable stronger impacts in simplified communities such as those on oceanic islands. However, logistical difficulties have hindered the experimental and theoretical need to disentangle the roles of species identity, richness (i.e. number of species) and abundance. Consequently, studies to date have focused exclusively on the loss of species richness leaving us largely ignorant regarding how species identity and abundance affect the loss of ecosystem functions. 2. Here, we applied a network approach to disentangle the effects of disperser abundance, richness and identity on the seed dispersal service provided by frugivores to the Galapagos plant community. 3. We found that both abundance and richness of the dispersers significantly affect the function of seed dispersal and that richness becomes increasingly important as disperser abundance declines. Extinction simulations revealed that the order of species loss has profound implications to the plant community. On the one hand, abundant generalist dispersers like the Galapagos lizards, can mitigate the loss of specialized dispersers. On the other hand, specific threats affecting key dispersers can lead to the rapid collapse of the community-level dispersal services. 4. Our results suggest that the identity of the disperser species lost can have a large effect on the number of plant species dispersed, and generalist species are essential to the persistence of the community dispersal service. Both abundance and species richness of seed dispersers are key and synergistic drivers of the number of plant species dispersed. Consequently, the coupled negative effect of population declines and species extinctions in frugivore assemblages may lead to an accelerated loss of the seed dispersal function.",2017

The impact of intentional wildflower plantings on remnant native plant diversity in urban and peri-urban settings has not received attention, although shared pollinators are likely to mediate several types of biotic interactions between human-introduced plants and remnant native ones. Additionally, if wildflower species escape gardens these indirect effects may be compounded with direct ones. We review the potential positive and negative impacts of wildflower gardens on urban native flowering plants, and we reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge. We present a roadmap for research to address whether wildflower gardens, while benefiting pollinators, could also hasten the extinction of native remnant plants in urban settings, or whether they could have other effects that enrich urban biodiversity. Goals of future wildflower mixes should consider the totality of potential interactions.",2017
Comparison of orchid bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) species composition collected with four chemical attractants,chemical ecology; Mesoamerican euglossines; benzyl acetate; eucalyptol; cineole; pollinator biodiversity; eugenol; methyl salicylate,EUGLOSSINE BEES,"Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are a diverse and important group of Neotropical pollinators. Numerous chemicals have been used in sampling orchid bees, and species-specific attraction, particularly of males, to these chemicals is well known. However, there have been few studies that have quantified differences in the species composition of orchid bees attracted to particular chemicals. In this study, we compared the abundance and species composition of orchid bees collected with 4 commonly used attractants: benzyl acetate, eucalyptol (or cineole), eugenol, and methyl salicylate. Eucalyptol collected the greatest abundance and species richness of orchid bees. Indicator species analysis revealed that 3 species, Euglossa imperialis Cockerell, Euglossa obtusa Dressler, and Eufriesea mexicana (Mocsary), were significantly associated with eucalyptol, and 1, Eulaema marcii Nemesio, with benzyl acetate. The multi-response permutation procedure revealed relatively large differences in species composition of orchid bees collected with eucalyptol vs. benzyl acetate and eucalyptol vs. eugenol. Our results showed that eucalyptol and benzyl acetate were the most effective and complimentary attractants, but even less effective attractants such as eugenol may attract novel species.",2017

Reduced plant diversity has been proposed as an indirect factor responsible for the pollinator crisis. We suggest stoichiometric mismatch resulting from a nutritionally unbalanced diet as a potential direct factor. The concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu were studied in the bodies of honeybees of various castes and sexes and in the nectar and pollen of various plant species. A literature review of the elemental composition of pollen was performed. We identified possible co-limitations of bee growth and development resulting mainly from the scarcity of Na, S, Cu, P and K, and possibly Zn and N, in pollen. Particular castes and sexes face specific limitations. Concentrations of potentially limiting elements in pollen revealed high taxonomic diversity. High floral diversity may be necessary to maintain populations of pollen eaters. Single-species crop plantations, even if these species are rich in nectar and pollen, might limit bee growth and development, not allowing for gathering nutrients in adequate proportions. However, particular plant species may play greater roles than others in balancing honeybee diets. Therefore, we suggest specific plant species that may (1) ensure optimal growth and production of individuals by producing pollen that is exceptionally well balanced stoichiometrically (e.g., clover) or (2) prevent growth and development of honeybees by producing pollen that is extremely unbalanced for bees (e.g., sunflower). Since pollen is generally poor in Na, this element must be supplemented using ""dirty water"". Nectar cannot supplement the diet with limiting elements. Stoichiometric mismatch should be considered in intervention strategies aimed at improving the nutritional base for bees.",2017

Here, we ask whether, and to what extent, landscape simplification, measured as the percentage of arable land in the landscape, disrupts the functional and phylogenetic association between primary producers and consumers. Across seven European regions, we inferred the potential associations (functional and phylogenetic) between host plants and butterflies in 561 seminatural grasslands. Local plant diversity showed a strong bottom-up effect on butterfly diversity in the most complex landscapes, but this effect disappeared in simple landscapes. The functional associations between plant and butterflies are, therefore, the results of processes that act not only locally but are also dependent on the surrounding landscape context. Similarly, landscape simplification reduced the phylogenetic congruence among host plants and butterflies indicating that closely related butterflies become more generalist in the resources used. These processes occurred without any detectable change in species richness of plants or butterflies along the gradient of arable land. The structural properties of ecosystems are experiencing substantial erosion, with potentially pervasive effects on ecosystem functions and future evolutionary trajectories. Loss of interacting species might trigger cascading extinction events and reduce the stability of trophic interactions, as well as influence the longer term resilience of ecosystem functions. This underscores a growing realization that species richness is a crude and insensitive metric and that both functional and phylogenetic associations, measured across multiple trophic levels, are likely to provide additional and deeper insights into the resilience of ecosystems and the functions they provide.",2017

Therefore, in this work, we studied the modern pollen rain in sediments of the Amendoim Lake, plateaus of the Serra Sul dos Carajas, southeastern Amazonia. This study indicates the predominance of pollen grains from forest formation (ombrophilous forests and capAo florestal) over montane savanna in the lake sediments, despite the fact that montane savanna occupies 90% of the drainage basin. Additionally, these sediments reflect stronger signal of pollen from ombrophilous forests that occur in the slopes of the plateau. Important components of montane savanna such as Vellozia and Cereus were not observed in the modern pollen rain, which may be related to their shorter flowering periods restricted to the beginning of wetter conditions. The absence of Sacoglottis, Trichilia, Clusia, Emmotum, Guapira and Simarouba in the pollen rain is likely associated with different pollination strategy. The occurrence of windblown pollen of Alchornea, Pseudolmedia, Ilex and Cecropia, which are found from low to highlands of the Carajas region, reinforces a regional vegetation signal in sediments. Several plants from the studied site have been improperly described, according to taxonomy and ecology. For example, the current occurrence of Ilex and Styrax in the study site clearly suggests that they cannot be used as indicators of colder palaeoclimate conditions, as previously described. In addition, Poaceae can be found in drier to wetter substrate conditions, and abundance of their pollen grains in lakes can significantly vary according to relief morphology and cannot indicate palaeovegetation openness. Therefore, this work is a good background for further palaeobotany studies for this region.",2017
Selecting plant species for practical restoration of degraded lands using a multiple-trait approach,Amazonia; conservation; ecosystem services; mine lands; sustainable development,ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CHANGING WORLD; REINTRODUCTION; PERSPECTIVES; POLLINATORS; IRONSTONE; OUTCROPS; RECOVERY,"Ecological restoration is essential in rehabilitating degraded areas and safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare. Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families. The final list of species and their traits highlight the importance of preserving not only the historical reference of a focused ecosystem but also its functional diversity to restore the interaction with local fauna, enrich the food chain and guarantee ecosystem services for local communities.",2017

We investigate the dynamic evolution of hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes in the centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae), an Andean-centered group of approximate to 550 angiosperm species. We demonstrate that flowers hypothesized to be adapted to different pollinators based on flower color fall into distinct regions of morphospace, and this is validated by morphology of species with known pollinators. This supports the existence of pollination syndromes in the centropogonids, an idea corroborated by ecological studies. We further demonstrate that hummingbird pollination is ancestral, and that bat pollination has evolved approximate to 13 times independently, with approximate to 11 reversals. This convergence is associated with correlated evolution of floral traits within selective regimes corresponding to pollination syndrome. Collectively, our results suggest that floral morphological diversity is extremely labile, likely resulting from selection imposed by pollinators. Finally, even though this clade's rapid diversification is partially attributed to their association with vertebrate pollinators, we detect no difference in diversification rates between hummingbird- and bat-pollinated lineages. Our study demonstrates the utility of pollination syndromes as a proxy for ecological relationships in macroevolutionary studies of certain species-rich clades.",2017

This study evaluated the success of the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project in Durban, South Africa, by assessing ecological attributes. Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0-year-old, 3-year-old and 5-year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the inclusion of species with missing pollination and seed dispersal categories.",2017
Global patterns of interaction specialization in bird-flower networks,honeyeaters; hummingbirds; modularity; niche partitioning; ornithophily; plant-animal interactions; specialization; sunbirds,SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS; POLLINATION SYSTEMS; ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SPECIES RICHNESS; RAIN-FOREST; PLANT; HUMMINGBIRDS; EVOLUTIONARY,"Aim Among the world's three major nectar-feeding bird taxa, hummingbirds are the most phenotypically specialized for nectarivory, followed by sunbirds, while the honeyeaters are the least phenotypically specialized taxa. We tested whether this phenotypic specialization gradient is also found in the interaction patterns with their floral resources. Location Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania/Australia. Methods We compiled interaction networks between birds and floral resources for 79 hummingbird, nine sunbird and 33 honeyeater communities. Interaction specialization was quantified through connectance (C), complementary specialization (H-2), binary (Q(B)) and weighted modularity (Q), with both observed and null-model corrected values. We compared interaction specialization among the three types of bird-flower communities, both independently and while controlling for potential confounding variables, such as plant species richness, asymmetry, latitude, insularity, topography, sampling methods and intensity. Results Hummingbird-flower networks were more specialized than honeyeater-flower networks. Specifically, hummingbird-flower networks had a lower proportion of realized interactions (lower C), decreased niche overlap (greater H-2) and greater modularity (greater Q(B)). However, we found no significant differences between hummingbird- and sunbird-flower networks, nor between sunbird- and honeyeater-flower networks. Main conclusions As expected, hummingbirds and their floral resources have greater interaction specialization than honeyeaters, possibly because of greater phenotypic specialization and greater floral resource richness in the New World. Interaction specialization in sunbird-flower communities was similar to both hummingbird-flower and honeyeater-flower communities. This may either be due to the relatively small number of sunbird-flower networks available, or because sunbird-flower communities share features of both hummingbird-flower communities (specialized floral shapes) and honeyeater-flower communities (fewer floral resources). These results suggest a link between interaction specialization and both phenotypic specialization and floral resource richness within bird-flower communities at a global scale.",2017

Mathematical models and empirical work have explored the multiple ways coevolution could occur in small sets of species, revealing that the addition of even one species can change the coevolutionary dynamics of a pairwise interaction. As a consequence, one of the current challenges in evolutionary biology is to understand how species-rich assemblages evolve and coevolve as networks of interacting species. We combined an adaptive network framework, a trait evolutionary model, and data on network structure to study how network organization affects and is affected by selection in antagonistic interactions such as parasitism, predation, and herbivory. We explored how selection imposed by interactions shapes the evolution of attack and defense traits, parameterizing our models with structural information from 31 empirical assemblages of antagonistic species. In the simulations, the form of coevolution in antagonistic interactions is affected by the intensity and asymmetry of the selection imposed by the interacting partners. Transient escalation in attack and defensive traits was the most prevalent form of coevolutionary dynamics, especially in networks formed by modules of highly interacting species. Fluctuating evolution of traits was observed when the intensity of selection was higher in exploiters than in victims and was especially favored in nested networks. At the species level, highly connected species experienced higher temporal variation in selection regardless of the network structure, resulting in high trait mismatching with their partners. The mismatched patterns of highly connected species, in turn, may explain the emergence of modularity in antagonistic interactions in which selection is stronger on exploiters than on their victims. Our results highlight the roles of different aspects of network structure on antagonistic coevolution: nestedness shapes coevolutionary dynamics, whereas modularity emerges as one outcome of coevolutionary dynamics.",2017

Their secretions mediate a specialized interaction between oil-producing plants and a few species of oil-collecting bees - Apidae and Melittidae. The present review focuses on the morphological and functional aspects of these secretory structures. We also provide information on their chemistry and pollination ecology. Our survey is organized taxonomically among the plant families for which elaiophore occurrence has been confirmed - for the monocots, Iridaceae and Orchidaceae, and for the eudicots, Calceolariaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Krameriaceae, Malpighiaceae, Plantaginaceae, Primulaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Solanaceae and Stilbaceae. Most oil flowers are zygomorphic, bisexual, nectarless and present their elaiophores on the protective whorls or on the androecium. Trichomal elaiophores are reported in all of these families except Krameriaceae and Malpighiaceae, and they vary in the density and morphology of the trichomes. Epithelial elaiophores occur in some monocot representatives and in Krameriaceae and Malpighiaceae, and are similar among species. An intermediate type of elaiophore is reported in some species of Orchidaceae. Regardless of elaiophore type, these glands have similar subcellular features and secretion-release mechanisms. Finally, we note the dearth of information on elaiophore ultrastructure and functioning for several plant families.",2017
The relative importance of pollinator abundance and species richness for the temporal variance of pollination services,abundance; biodiversity; composition; ecosystem services; Price equation; richness; variance,DIVERSITY-STABILITY RELATIONSHIPS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; CROP POLLINATION; PRICE EQUATION; NATIVE BEES; STATISTICAL INEVITABILITY; BIODIVERSITY EXPERIMENTS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HONEY-BEES; BODY-SIZE,"The relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem function is a fundamental question in community ecology, and hundreds of experiments have shown a positive relationship between species richness and the stability of ecosystem function. However, these experiments have rarely accounted for common ecological patterns, most notably skewed species abundance distributions and non-random extinction risks, making it difficult to know whether experimental results can be scaled up to larger, less manipulated systems. In contrast with the prolific body of experimental research, few studies have examined how species richness affects the stability of ecosystem services at more realistic, landscape scales. The paucity of these studies is due in part to a lack of analytical methods that are suitable for the correlative structure of ecological data. A recently developed method, based on the Price equation from evolutionary biology, helps resolve this knowledge gap by partitioning the effect of biodiversity into three components: richness, composition, and abundance. Here, we build on previous work and present the first derivation of the Price equation suitable for analyzing temporal variance of ecosystem services. We applied our new derivation to understand the temporal variance of crop pollination services in two study systems (watermelon and blueberry) in the mid-Atlantic United States. In both systems, but especially in the watermelon system, the stronger driver of temporal variance of ecosystem services was fluctuations in the abundance of common bee species, which were present at nearly all sites regardless of species richness. In contrast, temporal variance of ecosystem services was less affected by differences in species richness, because lost and gained species were rare. Thus, the findings from our more realistic landscapes differ qualitatively from the findings of biodiversity-stability experiments.",2017
Wild bee community change over a 26-year chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairie,beta diversity; community composition; nontarget organisms; pollinators; prairie remnants,ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; HABITAT STRUCTURE; FORAGING RANGES; BETA-DIVERSITY; BODY-SIZE; ECOSYSTEM; FOREST; PLANT; CONVERGENCE,"Restoration efforts often focus on plants, but additionally require the establishment and long-term persistence of diverse groups of nontarget organisms, such as bees, for important ecosystem functions and meeting restoration goals. We investigated long-term patterns in the response of bees to habitat restoration by sampling bee communities along a 26-year chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairie in north-central Illinois, U.S.A. Specifically, we examined how bee communities changed over time since restoration in terms of (1) abundance and richness, (2) community composition, and (3) the two components of beta diversity, one-to-one species replacement, and changes in species richness. Bee abundance and raw richness increased with restoration age from the low level of the pre-restoration (agricultural) sites to the target level of the remnant prairie within the first 2-3 years after restoration, and these high levels were maintained throughout the entire restoration chronosequence. Bee community composition of the youngest restored sites differed from that of prairie remnants, but 5-7 years post-restoration the community composition of restored prairie converged with that of remnants. Landscape context, particularly nearby wooded land, was found to affect abundance, rarefied richness, and community composition. Partitioning overall beta diversity between sites into species replacement and richness effects revealed that the main driver of community change over time was the gradual accumulation of species, rather than one-to-one species replacement. At the spatial and temporal scales we studied, we conclude that prairie restoration efforts targeting plants also successfully restore bee communities.",2017

Theoretical food webs have suggested that species-rich and highly complex communities are inherently unstable, but incorporating certain characteristics of empirical communities, such as allometric body size scaling and non-random interaction distributions, have been shown to enhance stability and facilitate species coexistence. Incorporating individual level traits and variability into food web theory is seen as a future pathway for this research and our growing knowledge of individual behaviours, in the form of temperament (or personality) traits, can inform the direction of this research. Temperament traits are consistent differences in behaviour between individuals, which are repeatable across time and/or across ecological contexts, such as aggressive or boldness behaviours that commonly differ between individuals of the same species. These traits, under the framework of behavioural reaction norms, show both individual consistency as well as contextual and phenotypic plasticity. This is likely to contribute significantly to the effects of individual trait variability and adaptive trophic behaviour on the structure and dynamics of food webs, which are apparently stabilizing. Exploring the role of temperament in the context of community ecology is a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between ecological fields, and can provide new insights into community stability and biodiversity.",2017

Considering that networks vary with the integrity of ecosystems, their changes may help to predict the consequences of anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity and ecological processes. This characteristic highlights its use as environmental quality indicator. However, to employ interaction networks as ecological indicators it is necessary to identify the most sensitive metrics and understand how and why they vary with environmental changes. This review aimed to identify, in empirical studies, which network metrics have been evidenced as being more sensitive to changes in environmental quality. We analyzed published empirical studies, that applied the network approach on environmental quality gradients. In addition to the network metric behavior, we studied the interactions between them and possible causes of their variation. The available empirical data indicated that degree, nestedness and connectance did not have a simple, linear or unidirectional response to habitat degradation. Conversely, the metrics interaction asymmetry, d' (reciprocal specialization index of the species) showed the most consistent responses to environmental change. The role of the species changed, ranging between generalists and specialists under different conditions. In addition, specialist species with morphological and behavioral constraints were lost in worse environmental quality situations. The identity of interacting species and their role in the network, with a further specification of groups and interactions most affected, are the properties with greater potential to indicate changes in environmental quality. Most of the available studies focused on metrics at the network level, but several studies and this review indicate that the patterns at the network level can be better understood in the light of metrics analyzed at the species level. Our results provide information that enrich the network analysis, highlighting the need to consider important features that are often neglected. Discussions and information compiled here are important for deciding how to look at empirical data and what to look for, as well as to indicate some caveats when interpreting data on plant-pollinator interactions with a complex network approach. Network metrics can be good indicators of environmental quality if the underlying ecological causes of the numerical changes are carefully analyzed.  ",2017

Most Encephalartos and S. eriopus adults appear to be fire-tolerant, and certain Encephalartos species may be fire-dependent. Four Encephalartos species and S. eriopus are primarily insect-pollinated. African cycad populations typically have sex ratios of 1:1, with very small populations often male-biased. Coning is typically infrequent and erratic, with many species exhibiting mast-seeding. Viable seed production in Encephalartos populations tends to decline with decreasing population size, and seed predation by weevils is common. Seed dispersal in Encephalartos is usually localized, but vertebrates may facilitate dispersal over longer distances. Stem material of 25 Encephalartos species and S. eriopus is used for traditional medicine, primarily in South Africa. Two-thirds of Africa's cycad species are threatened, with four species already Extinct in the Wild. The illegal acquisition of cycads from wild populations is the principle threat to their persistence.

A study of the petal epidermis may be useful to systematics as well as to the knowledge of ecological and co-evolutionary adaptations between the parasites and their pollinators. The present work is a comparative study of the microsculpture of nectar guides and landing platforms in the flowers of holoparasitic species in the family Orobanchaceae. In total, 285 samples of 39 species from 10 holoparasitic genera (Boschniakia C.A.Mey. ex Bong., Boulardia F.W.Schultz, Cistanche Hoffmanns. & Link, Conopholis Wallr., Diphelypaea Nicolson, Epifagus Nutt., Mannagettaea H.Sm., Orobanche L., Phacellanthus Siebold & Zucc. and Phelipanche Pomel) and as an outgroup, of six additional hemiparasitic genera (Castilleja Mutis ex L.f., Euphrasia L., Orthantha (Benth.) A.Kern., Parentucellia Viv., Rhinanthus L., and Striga Lour.) were analysed using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Types of epidermal cells were characterised, and their distribution on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the petals determined. The following four major epidermal types were recognised: tabular rugose striate cells (TRS), areolate cells (AS), papillose conical cells (PCS) and lobular striate cells (PLS). Two main types of trichomes were observed, namely glandular and non-glandular.

Ranking of critical species to preserve the functionality of mutualistic networks using the k-core decomposition,Mutualism; k-core decomposition; Robustness; Complex networks,POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; ROBUSTNESS; BIODIVERSITY; WEBS; ARCHITECTURE; INCREASES; FRAGILITY; GRAPHS,"Background. Network analysis has become a relevant approach to analyze cascading species extinctions resulting from perturbations on mutualistic interactions as a result of environmental change. In this context, it is essential to be able to point out key species, whose stability would prevent cascading extinctions, and the consequent loss of ecosystem function. In this study, we aim to explain how the k-core decomposition sheds light on the understanding the robustness of bipartite mutualistic networks. Methods. We defined three k-magnitudes based on the k-core decomposition: k-radius, k-degree, and k-risk. The first one, k-radius, quantifies the distance from a node to the innermost shell of the partner guild, while k-degree provides a measure of centrality in the k-shell based decomposition. k-risk is a way to measure the vulnerability of a network to the loss of a particular species. Using these magnitudes we analyzed 89 mutualistic networks involving plant pollinators or seed dispersers. Two static extinction procedures were implemented in which k-degree and k-risk were compared against other commonly used ranking indexes, as for example MusRank, explained in detail in Material and Methods. Results. When extinctions take place in both guilds, k-risk is the best ranking index if the goal is to identify the key species to preserve the giant component. When species are removed only in the primary class and cascading extinctions are measured in the secondary class, the most effective ranking index to identify the key species to preserve the giant component is k-degree. However, MusRank index was more effective when the goal is to identify the key species to preserve the greatest species richness in the second class. Discussion. The k-core decomposition offers a new topological view of the structure of mutualistic networks. The new k-radius, k-degree and k-risk magnitudes take advantage of its properties and provide new insight into the structure of mutualistic networks. The k-risk and k-degree ranking indexes are especially effective approaches to identify key species to preserve when conservation practitioners focus on the preservation of ecosystem functionality over species richness.",2017

In the last decade, many studies have documented the negative impact of tramp and invasive ant species (ITS) on native ant species mainly through competitive displacement and behavior. However, despite the great advances in the knowledge of TIS, still little is known about the impacts of these ants on the trophic cascade. In this study we used an approach based on network theory to explore the impact of TIS on the structure and ecological dynamic of a well-sampled and well-known community of ant plant interactions in a tropical environment in coastal Veracruz, Mexico. We observed that of all the ant-plant interactions recorded, only 15% involved TIS and the ant Paratrechina longicomis (Formicinae) was the unique tramp species to be part of the central core of highly interacting species. We also found that TIS had little impact on the structure and dynamic ant-plant interactions in our study area, although possible indirect effects for specific TIS are also discussed. This study represents a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show the vulnerability and robustness of a tropical system rich in species and interactions to biological invasions.",2017

Because species are embedded in species-rich systems characterized by multiple interactions, it is often hard to identify which species are really important for ecological processes such as pollination. Here we show that species-rich networks describing plant-pollinator interactions share a property with networks depicting social relationships, the friendship paradox, which allows identifying highly-connected species without detailed information on the whole network of interactions. Numerical simulations support that the identified species are those more likely to affect community structure and ecological dynamics. A sampling protocol taking into account the friendship paradox property could be adapted to field studies, helping in the search for conservation surrogates or to monitor changes in the communities, such as functional extinction or the increase in ecological importance of invasive species. We hypothesize that the friendship paradox is likely to arise in networks describing other types of ecological interactions. Besides being useful for conservation and ecosystem management, the friendship paradox may have relevant implications in other areas of biology as well.  ",2017

We compared Banksia attenuata R.Br. (Proteaceae) in a low species diversity restoration site and an adjacent natural remnant. We assessed fecundity genetic diversity in adult plants and their offspring, mating system parameters and pollen dispersal using paternity assignment. Results were compared to an earlier study of reproductive functionality within a high species diversity restoration site that was restored in a similar manner, enabling us to investigate any association between plant species diversity and fecundity. Seed set data indicated no significant differences between restored and adjacent natural sites; however, seed set data between restoration sites was significantly different (2.08 +/- 0.39 and 6.89 +/- 1.12, respectively). The mean number of fruits (follicles) per inflorescence was not significantly different between restoration sites. Genetic diversity of adult plants and their offspring were comparable in all sites. Higher allelic richness and genetic differentiation in one restored site reflected sourcing beyond local provenance. Low correlated paternity indicated high levels of multiple siring of seeds and paternity assignment demonstrated strong genetic connectivity between sites. Reproductive functionality, as measured by fecundity and genetic diversity in the offspring of B. attenuata, is resilient to low species diversity within a restored plant community. We consider our results in the context of establishing seed production areas (SPAs) that maximize the quantity and genetic quality of Banksia seeds for restoration.",2017

Typically, windthrown timber is salvaged for economic and phytosanitary reasons. This markedly affects the natural development of the disturbed areas, in particular by removing important dead wood resources. For a sustainable and ecologically sound management of disturbance effects, more knowledge is needed on the impact of windthrow and salvage logging on animal species communities. We monitored various arthropod taxa (spiders and insects) two and five years after the storm Lothar in 1999 in salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows as well as in adjacent intact forests. Basing on a comprehensive data set with 1276 species and 228,718 individuals, species diversity, abundance and community composition were compared. Species richness and abundance of most taxonomic and functional groups (pollinators, saproxylics and predators) in the windthrow habitats clearly differed from those in the intact forests. On average, twice as many species were present in windthrows as in the forest. Windthrows also supported more red-listed beetles (mainly saproxylics) than the intact forest and more habitat indicator species (mainly Heteroptera and Aculeata) were found in windthrow areas. No difference in species diversity was found between salvaged and unsalvaged windthrows. However, similarity analyses showed that the communities of certain taxonomic and functional groups differed between the two salvaging treatments. A combination of unsalvaged and salvaged windthrows in intact forests increased local species richness approximately 2.5 times relative to that in the forests alone. Therefore after large-scale windthrows, a mosaic of salvaged and unsalvaged windthrow patches fosters high forest biodiversity levels.   ",2017

Changes in grazing intensity have led to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, resulting in loss of some of these ES. This emphasizes the need for grassland management schemes that aim to maximize economic returns from grasslands while maintaining ecosystem functioning, but tools to assess the tradeoffs between economic benefits and Ecosystem Services are, for the most part, lacking. This study is aimed at economically valuing multiple ecosystem services, and the tradeoffs between them and species richness, across different management alternatives (control, light, moderate and heavy grazing) in the Karei-Deshe experimental farm and Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) site. Ecological data from previous research in Karei-Deshe was valuated using the Replacement Cost Method and a Contingent Valuation survey, which valued the farm's landscape. Grazing intensity was inversely related to the delivery of ES studied and positively related to species richness, except for heavy grazing, which resulted in lower species richness. Only heavy grazing was found to be an inefficient management alternative. This research demonstrates a fairly simple path for providing land managers an ecological-data-based tool for comparing management alternatives.",2017

At the same time, the gardens themselves are dependent upon the pollination services provided by insects. Thus, understanding the variables that can increase bee richness or abundance in community gardens can contribute to both urban agriculture and pollinator conservation. Here we examine the impact of several environmental variables on bee abundance and diversity in urban community gardens in Sydney, Australia. We used hand netting and trap nests to sample bees in 27 community gardens ranging from inner city gardens with limited surrounding green space, to suburban gardens located next to national parks. We did not find strong support for an impact of any of our variables on bee species richness, abundance or diversity. We found high abundance of a recently introduced non-native bee: the African carder bee, Afranthidium repetitum (Schulz 1906). The abundance of African carder bees was negatively correlated with the amount of surrounding green space and positively correlated with native bee abundance/species richness. Our results highlight the seemingly rapid increase in African carder bee populations in inner city Sydney, and we call for more research into this bee's potential environmental impacts. Our results also suggest that hard-to-change environmental factors such as garden size and distance to remnant forests may not have a strong influence on native bee diversity and abundance in highly urbanized area.",2017
Non-target effects of fungicides on nectar-inhabiting fungi of almond flowers,,FLORAL NECTAR; BUMBLE BEES; HONEY-BEES; COMMUNITIES; YEASTS; POLLINATORS; MECHANISMS; RESISTANCE; MICROBES; COLONIES,"Nectar mediates interactions between plants and pollinators in natural and agricultural systems. Specialized microorganisms are common nectar inhabitants, and potentially important mediators of plant-pollinator interactions. However, their diversity and role in mediating pollination services in agricultural systems are poorly characterized. Moreover, agrochemicals are commonly applied to minimize crop damage, but may present ecological consequences for non-target organisms. Assessment of ecological risk has tended to focus on beneficial macroorganisms such as pollinators, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Here, using culture-independent methods, we assess the impact of two widely-used fungicides on nectar microbial community structure in the mass-flowering crop almond (Prunus dulcis). We predicted that fungicide application would reduce fungal richness and diversity, whereas competing bacterial richness would increase, benefitting from negative effects on fungi. We found that fungicides reduced fungal richness and diversity in exposed flowers, but did not significantly affect bacterial richness, diversity, or community composition. The relative abundance of Metschnikowia OTUs, nectar specialists that can impact pollination, was reduced by both fungicides. Given growing recognition of theimportance of nectar microorganisms as mediators of plant-pollinator mutualisms, future research should consider the impact of management practiceson plant-associated microorganisms and consequences for pollination services in agricultural landscapes.",2017
The Similar Usage of a Common Key Resource Does Not Determine Similar Responses by Species in A Community of Oil-collecting Bees,Centridini; oil quantification; oil-flowers; oil-bees; savanna,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; NE BRAZIL; HYMENOPTERA; MALPIGHIACEAE; POLLINATION; CENTRIDINI; DIVERSITY; FOREST; APIDAE; POPULATION,"Variations in abundance and species richness among communities are often determined by interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. However, for communities composed of species that share a common specialization (such as similar foraging adaptations) it may be a key ecological factor involved in the common specialization that affects community variations. To evaluate this possibility, we characterized the guild of oil-collecting bees of a Neotropical savanna in Brazil and tested whether differences in Byrsonima abundance and availability of floral oil explain differences in species richness and abundance of oil-collecting bees of different tribes. Both the number of species and total abundance of Centridini species increased with the abundance of Byrsonima. One plausible explanation for the stronger adjustment between the abundance of Centridini and Byrsonima is that the abundance of these plants affects not only the availability of floral oil, but also of pollen. These findings indicate that the existence of a common specialization among different species does not homogenize their response to variations in a common explored resource.",2017

Landscape degradation exacerbates environmental adversity and reduces resource availability, imposing higher costs of living for many organisms. Here, we report a significant effect of landscape degradation on the FMR of free-flyingApis mellifera, estimated using Rb-86 radio-isotopic turnover. We validated the relationship between Rb-86 k(b) and metabolic rate for worker bees in the laboratory using flow-through respirometry. We then released radioisotopically enriched individuals into a natural woodland and a heavily degraded and deforested plantation. FMRs of worker bees in natural woodland vegetation were significantly higher than in a deforested landscape. Nectar consumption, estimated using Na-22 radio-isotopic turnover, also differed significantly between natural and degraded landscapes. In the deforested landscape, we infer that the costs of foraging exceeded energetic availability, and honeybees instead foraged less and depended more on stored resources in the hive. If this is generally the case with increasing landscape degradation, this will have important implications for the provision of pollination services and the effectiveness and resilience of ecological restoration practice.",2017
Weed species structural and functional composition of okra fields and field periphery under different management intensities along the rural-urban gradient of two West African cities,Agricultural intensification; Anthropogenic; Plant traits; Sub-Saharan Africa; Weed biodiversity,PLANT DIVERSITY; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; CROP FIELDS; BIODIVERSITY; TRAITS; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPE; SUCCESSION,"In urban and peri-urban agricultural production systems of Sub-Saharan African cities, diverse and functional complex weed communities may help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and therefore indirectly support crop performance. However, effects of agricultural intensification and urbanisation on important weed diversity in the West African region had received so far little attention, although in Burkina Faso and Ghana up to 90 per cent of the population depends on agriculture as a main source of income generation. Hence, our research focussed on the analysis of changes in weed assemblages' structure and function of okra fields that were cultivated under different management intensities and were embedded into the rural, peri-urban and urban environment of two West African cities: Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and Tamale (Ghana). We found a strong relationship between gender and market orientation of okra cultivation. Market orientation of okra farmers was also a major driver in shaping weed species assemblages and led to the development of a distinct weed assemblage in urban areas that even showed higher diversity in weeds' function. Morphological plant traits (life form, seed properties) were most affected by agricultural practises; distribution pattern of ecological traits (seed dispersal mode, pollination vector) seemed to be influenced additionally by environmental characteristics with less entomophilous but more ornithochorous weed species on okra fields within urban areas. Our results revealed that the management of okra was highly variable and that this variation was influenced by fariners' socioeconomic background leading to changes in soil properties. These in turn may alter the functional diversity of beneficial weed communities beyond changes in species richness by potentially harming the provisioning of ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination.

Quantifying the the extent to which farmers can influence biodiversity on their farms,Agri-environment schemes; Birds; Butterflies; Ecological compensation; Farm scale; In-field options; Grasshoppers; Plants; Variance partitioning,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; ECOLOGICAL COMPENSATION AREAS; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; FARMLAND BIRDS; SCALE; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; GRASSLAND; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS,"Despite the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, no general increase of farmland biodiversity in Europe has been observed. Farmers take decisions about the implementation of agri-environmental schemes at the farm scale, and it is thus highly relevant to assess the relationship between farm management and biodiversity at this scale to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes. The present study quantifies to what extent and with which practices farmers can influence biodiversity on their farm and to what extent conditions outside farmers' control may mediate biodiversity. We grouped 27 variables into four variable sets: (1) ecological compensation (mainly semi-natural habitats), (2) in-field options (e.g. no growth regulator, insecticide and herbicide treatment), and (3) farm characteristics, which can be influenced by farmers (e.g. land-use types) as well as (4) farm settings, which cannot be influenced by farmers (e.g. altitude). As biodiversity metrics, plant, grasshopper, butterfly and bird richness and abundance of farmland target species were assessed on 133 farms of the Swiss Central Plateau from 2009 to 2011. Variance partitioning and generalised linear mixed models were used to analyse the impact of each variable set on farmland species diversity. Our results provide evidence that farmers can indeed positively influence biodiversity by ecological compensation and in-field options. The variables of the ecological compensation set explained the highest proportion in the variation of plant richness and butterfly abundance. We found a significant positive relationship between in-field options and plant abundance. Our study illustrated that the effects of biodiversity-related farming practices differ between species and biodiversity metrics. Conditions outside farmers' control explained a high variation in grasshopper and bird diversity. One variable within the set of farm settings, the degree of consolidation, had a significant negative impact on five out of eight biodiversity metrics (plant, butterfly and bird richness; plant and bird abundance). We demonstrate that farmers can substantially enhance biodiversity on their farms and provide knowledge on how such biodiversity improvements can be achieved by farmers. Further, we highlight the value of new biodiversity-related management practices such as in-field options.    ",2017
Comparative micromorphology and anatomy of flowers and floral secretory structures in two Viburnum species,Histochemistry; Micromorphology and anatomy; Nectaries and trichomes; Stigma microstructure; Viburnum flowering,REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; NECTARIES; CAPRIFOLIACEAE; ADOXACEAE; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGENY; STIGMA; DIVERSIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; POLLINATORS,"In entomogamous plants, the presence and function of floral secretory structures, whose main role is to attract pollinators, is strictly associated with the pollination ecology and hence the reproductive success of the plant. The aims of the present paper were to analyse the micromorphology and anatomy of flower nectaries and stigmas in Viburnum opulus and V. lantana and to determine the function and microstructure of inflorescence trichomes in both taxa using light and scanning electron microscopy as well as histochemical assays. It was found that stigmas were formed by papillae, which contained lipids, polysaccharides, tannins, and pigments. Stigmatic secretion proceeded via cuticular pores. Floral nectaries formed a thick layer around the styles, and nectar was secreted through numerous nectarostomata. There were no traces of vascular bundles penetrating the nectary tissue. In turn, numerous tannin deposits were observed in the cells of the glandular parenchyma. Pedicels, hypanthia, and bracts had mainly peltate and capitate glandular trichomes as well as stellate non-glandular trichomes (in V. lantana). The trichomes were shown to contain lipids, mucilage, and tannins. Many similarities in the flower and nectaries microstructure and considerable heterogeneity were observed in the examined Viburnum species. Knowledge of the microstructural characteristics of flowers, nectaries, and trichomes may be important for the phylogenesis and taxonomy of the genus Viburnum and the family Adoxaceae. Additionally, floral and nectaries features are helpful in assessment of the relatedness between taxa and provide better understanding of the floral biology and pollination ecology.",2017
Disturbance-mediated heterogeneity drives pollinator diversity in boreal managed forest ecosystems,Anthophila; early-successional forest ecosystems; forest disturbance; prescribed fire; Syrphidae; diversity,BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; NESTING RESOURCES; SPATIAL VARIATION; REGRESSION TREES; GAMMA-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL CHANGE; LAND-USE; COMMUNITIES,"Intensive forest management, together with fire suppression, have decreased structural complexity and altered dynamics of boreal forests profoundly. Such management threatens forest biodiversity and can reduce the provision of ecosystem services. Although the importance of ecosystem services is widely acknowledged, conservation strategies are hindered by poor knowledge about diversity patterns of service provider species as well as on mechanisms affecting these assemblages at different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we assessed the effect of disturbance management on forest pollinator communities. To do so, we used a large-scale ecological experiment conducted in the year 2000, where forest complexity was manipulated with different harvest regimes and prescribed fire. Results were consistent with a positive response of pollinators to increasing habitat heterogeneity driven by past disturbances. Harvested sites harbored a diverse pollinator community, and showed higher spatial and temporal turnover in species richness. Conversely, old-growth forest communities were a nested subset of harvested sites and contained half of their total diversity. Variation in community composition ( diversity) was primarily affected by species temporal turnover. Throughout the season, diversity was controlled by fire and harvesting legacies, which provide environmental heterogeneity in the form of flowering and nesting resources over space and time. Conservation strategies may undervalue ecosystem services in dynamic, naturally disturbance-driven, landscapes when relying solely on undisturbed forests areas. However, maintaining natural dynamics in early successional forests, by emulating natural disturbances at harvesting, hold promise for the conservation of both biodiversity and ecosystem services in boreal forests.",2017
"Disentangling the contributions of dispersal limitation, ecological drift, and ecological filtering to wild bee community assembly",bees; community assembly; deterministic processes; dispersal; ecological drift; ecological filtering; functional traits; stochastic processes,POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; NEUTRAL-THEORY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; HABITAT; DIVERSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION; RESPONSES,"The species composition within communities is highly dependent on the rate of species immigration and whether immigrating species possess the functional traits required by the prevailing environmental conditions. Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species.",2017

While geological, climatic, and ecological processes collectively explain such radiations, their relative contributions are seldom examined within a single clade. We explore the contribution of these factors by applying a series of diversification models that incorporate mountain building, climate change, and trait evolution to the first dated phylogeny of Andean bellflowers (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae). Our framework is novel for its direct incorporation of geological data on Andean uplift into a macroevolutionary model. We show that speciation and extinction are differentially influenced by abiotic factors: speciation rates rose concurrently with Andean elevation, while extinction rates decreased during global cooling. Pollination syndrome and fruit type, both biotic traits known to facilitate mutualisms, played an additional role in driving diversification. These abiotic and biotic factors resulted in one of the fastest radiations reported to date: the centropogonids, whose 550 species arose in the last 5 million yr. Our study represents a significant advance in our understanding of plant evolution in Andean cloud forests. It further highlights the power of combining phylogenetic and Earth science models to explore the interplay of geology, climate, and ecology in generating the world's biodiversity.",2016
Protecting an Ecosystem Service: Approaches to Understanding and Mitigating Threats to Wild Insect Pollinators,,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS; EVIDENCE-BASED CONSERVATION; PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; BUMBLEBEE NEST DENSITY; BEE SPECIES RESPONSES; MIXED POLLEN SAMPLES; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; CROP POLLINATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE,"Insect pollination constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits as well as cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps, with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services; (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future. We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted, researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when developing research proposals and consider effective methods of knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions.",2016

Based on bimodal distributions of hawkmoth tongue lengths and tubular white flowers in Africa, this study hypothesized that long-tongued hawkmoths comprise a pollination niche (ecological opportunity) that is distinct from that of shorter-tongued hawkmoths. Methods Field observations, light trapping, camera surveillance and pollen load analysis were used to identify pollinators of plant species with very long-tubed (>8 cm) flowers. The nectar properties and spectral reflectance of these flowers were also measured. The frequency distributions of proboscis length for all captured hawkmoths and floral tube length for a representative sample of night-blooming plant species were determined. The geographical distributions of both native and introduced plant species with very long floral tubes were mapped. Key Results The convolvulus hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli is identified as the most important pollinator of African plants with very long-tubed flowers. Plants pollinated by this hawkmoth species tend to have a very long (approx. 10 cm) and narrow flower tube or spur, white flowers and large volumes of dilute nectar. It is estimated that >70 grassland and savanna plant species in Africa belong to the Agrius pollination guild. In South Africa, at least 23 native species have very long floral tubes, and pollination by A. convolvuli or, rarely, by the closely related hawkmoth Coelonia fulvinotata, has been confirmed for 11 of these species. The guild is strikingly absent from the species-rich Cape floral region and now includes at least four non-native invasive species with long-tubed flowers that are pre-adapted for pollination by A. convolvuli. Conclusions This study highlights the value of a niche perspective on pollination, which provides a framework for making predictions about the ecological importance of keystone pollinators, and for understanding patterns of convergent evolution and the role of floral traits in plant colonization.",2016
Pyrodiversity begets plant-pollinator community diversity,bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea); community assembly; drought; environmental heterogeneity; fire regime; fire severity,NEVADA WILDERNESS AREAS; FIRE REGIMES; MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPE; BIODIVERSITY HYPOTHESIS; CALIFORNIA DROUGHT; NESTING RESOURCES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ANT COMMUNITIES; NATIONAL-PARK; SEVERITY,"Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on plant-pollinator communities in mixed-conifer forest with frequent fire in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity, combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the pollinators, flowering plants, and plant-pollinator interactions. On average, a 5% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics contributes to the spatial heterogeneity (-diversity) of plant and pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought-induced floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition, lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover of plant-pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively affect the richness of plant-pollinator communities across large spatial scales.",2016

Pollination is an essential ecosystem service, which may rely on biodiversity for effectiveness and stability. Empirical examples which link functional outcomes of increased biodiversity to pollination services are rare. To investigate the importance of wild and managed pollinator communities to apple production, we assessed the effect of wild and managed bee abundance and diversity on pollen limitation and seed set on commercial farms in New York State. Seed set increased and pollen limitation decreased with increasing wild bee species richness, functional group diversity (based on nesting, sociality, and size traits), and abundance, but not with honey bee abundance. Functional group diversity explained more variation in apple seed set than species richness. Our findings demonstrate the important role of functional complementarity of wild bees, defined here as functional group diversity, to crop pollination even in the presence of large populations of managed honey bees. Therefore, our results suggest that management of diverse pollinator communities may decrease reliance on managed honey bees for pollination services and enhance crop yields.    ",2016
Sampling bias is a challenge for quantifying specialization and network structure: lessons from a quantitative niche model,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; HOST-SPECIFICITY; COMPLETENESS; CONSTRAINTS; NESTEDNESS; OVERLAP; INDEXES,"Network approaches have become a popular tool for understanding ecological complexity in a changing world. Many network descriptors relate directly or indirectly to specialization, which is a central concept in ecology and measured in different ways. Unfortunately, quantification of specialization and network structure using field data can suffer from sampling effects. Previous studies evaluating such sampling effects either used field data where the true network structure is unknown, or they simulated sampling based on completely generalized interactions. Here, we used a quantitative niche model to generate bipartite networks representing a wide range of specialization and evaluated potential sampling biases for a large set of specialization and network metrics for different network sizes. We show that with sample sizes realistic for species-rich networks, all metrics are biased towards overestimating specialization (and underestimating generalization and niche overlap). Importantly, this sampling bias depends on the true degree of specialization and is strongest for generalized networks. We show that methods used for empirical data may misrepresent sampling bias: null models simulating generalized interactions may overestimate bias, whereas richness estimators may strongly overestimate sampling completeness. Some network metrics are barely related between small and large sub-samples of the same network and thus may often not be meaningful. Small samples also overestimate interspecific variation of specialization within generalized networks. While new approaches to deal with these challenges have to be developed, we also identify metrics that are relatively unbiased and fairly consistent across sampling intensities and we identify a provisional rule of thumb for the number of observations required for accurate estimates. Our quantitative niche model can help understand variation in network structure capturing both sampling effects and biological meaning. This is needed to connect network science to fundamental ecological theory and to give robust quantitative answers for applied ecological problems.",2016
Functional community ecology meets restoration ecology: Assessing the restoration success of alluvial floodplain meadows with functional traits,ecological restoration; functional diversity; grasslands; hay transfer; plant functional traits; seed transfer from hay threshing; species diversity; species introduction,PLANT-MATERIAL TRANSFER; GRASSLAND RESTORATION; WETLAND RESTORATION; DIASPORE TRANSFER; SEED DISPERSAL; RE-CREATION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; DATABASE; IMPACT,"1. Species-rich grasslands are highly endangered habitats in Central Europe. To halt their ongoing loss, many sites have become subjects of restoration efforts. Traditionally, restoration success is measured using target species or by comparing similarity in species composition. Here, we suggest to additionally use functional community composition to assess restoration success as functional traits might offer mechanistic insights into restoration processes. 2. In a 5-year restoration experiment, we annually evaluated the responses of (i) floristic composition and species diversity, (ii) number and cover of target species, (iii) functional identity and (iv) functional diversity to four different methods of assisted recolonization through species introduction: hay transfer and application of threshing material from a local provenance, combined with and without addition of regional seed mixtures of target species, as well as to a control treatment. 3. Across all treatments, floristic composition, species diversity, and number and cover of target species approached the values of reference sites. In the last observation year, Shannon diversity was still lower in all treatment plots than in the reference plots, while the number of target forb species had reached or exceeded the reference levels. We demonstrated that the community was also restored functionally in many aspects, but not in all studied traits. Calculated community-weighted means (CWMs), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in experimental plots did not differ significantly from the reference plots, thereby indicating that productivity of restored sites had reached target values. In contrast, CWMs of strategy types and pollination modes revealed significant differences, showing that biotic interactions among plant species and with other trophic levels have not yet been fully restored. However, almost all CWMs showed a trajectory towards the reference, thus giving a positive prospect for the future development. With respect to functional diversity (FD), we found steadily increasing FD values for almost all traits analysed. 4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that all applied restoration measures were appropriate to achieve the restoration aim in terms of species composition of a given community and the establishment of target species. With respect to many functional traits, the restored meadows were already as functional as communities from the reference sites. Hence, including functional criteria did not only corroborate traditional criteria of restoration success but also allowed identifying those floodplain meadow's functions that can be quickly and less quickly restored.",2016

The industry has caused tropical deforestation on a massive scale in producing countries, and this forest conversion to oil palm agriculture has decimated the habitat of numerous native species. Monoculture and polyculture practices are two distinctive oil palm production systems. We hypothesize that polyculture farming hosts a greater diversity of species than monoculture farming. Habitat complexity in smallholdings is influenced by multiple farming practices (i.e. polyculture and monoculture). However, little is known about the effects of such farming practices in smallholdings on mammalian biodiversity, and particularly frugivorous bats. Our study aimed to find the best farming practice to reconcile oil palm production with biodiversity conservation. Mist-nets were used to trap frugivorous bats at 120 smallholdings in Peninsular Malaysia. We compared species richness and the abundance of frugivorous bats between monoculture and poly culture smallholdings. We investigated their relationships with vegetation structure characteristics. Our results revealed that species richness and abundance of frugivorous bats were significantly greater in polyculture smallholdings than monoculture smallholdings. We also found that 28.21% of the variation in species richness was explained by in situ habitat characteristics, including the number of dead standing oil palms and immature oil palms, non-grass cover, height of non-grass cover, and farming practices. The in situ habitat quality was closely associated with oil palm farming management. Commercial growers should implement polyculture rather than monoculture farming because polyculture farming has positive effects on the abundance and species richness of bats in oil palm production landscapes.

How phylogeny shapes the taxonomic and functional structure of plant-insect networks,Plant-pollinator; Plant-herbivore; Phylogenetic signal; Functional niche; Taxonomic niche,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS; RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; TRAITS; SPECIALIZATION; COMMUNITY; SIGNAL,"Phylogenetically related species share a common evolutionary history and may therefore have similar traits. In terms of interaction networks, where traits are a major determinant, related species should therefore interact with other species which are also related. However, this prediction is challenged by current evidence that there is a weak, albeit significant, phylogenetic signal in species' taxonomic niche, i.e., the identity of interacting species. We studied mutualistic and antagonistic plant-insect interaction networks in species-rich alpine meadows and show that there is instead a very strong phylogenetic signal in species' functional niches-i.e., the mean functional traits of their interactors. This pattern emerges because related species tend to interact with species bearing certain traits that allow biotic interactions (pollination, herbivory) but not necessarily with species from all the same evolutionary lineages. Those traits define a set of potential interactors and show clear patterns of phylogenetic clustering on several portions of plants and insect phylogenies. Thus, this emerging pattern of low phylogenetic signal in taxonomic niches but high phylogenetic signal in functional niches may be driven by the interplay between functional trait convergence across plants' and insects' phylogenies and random sampling of the potential interactors.",2016

Our knowledge of their geographic distributions and diversity patterns however is very limited possibly the poorest among mammals mainly due to their nocturnal and volant life history, and challenging fieldwork conditions in the tropics where most bat species occur. This knowledge gap obscures the geographic extent of ecosystem services provided by bats (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal and insect control), translates into inefficient conservation policies, and restricts macroecological analyses to coarse spatial resolutions. In contrast to the currently prevailing method of estimating species distributions using expert-drawn range maps, correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates at very fine spatial grains and largely account for widespread sample bias as well as the prevalent Wallacean shortfall in species occurrence data. Very few such studies have hitherto been published that cover a large and complete taxonomic group with fine resolution at continental extent. Using an unparalleled amount of occurrence data, the MaxEnt algorithm and tailored solutions to specific modelling challenges, we created SDMs for nearly all 250 African bat species to explore emerging diversity patterns at a resolution of 1 km(2). Predicted species richness generally increases towards the equator conforming to expectations. Within the tropical area of elevated richness, several pronounced richness peaks and lows stand out, hinting at a complex interplay of determining factors. Richness gradients are often steep, decreasing strongly away from streams, and especially so in savanna biomes. Species richness also seems positively associated with rugged terrain, in particular at lower elevations. Centres of endemism are found primarily at low latitudes near major elevational ranges. Overlap with hotspots of species richness is rather low, and confined to five or six topodiverse, relatively low lying areas between western Guinea and the East African coast. Several poorly sampled regions are identified that may represent rewarding future survey targets. Our results demonstrate the value of stacking SDMs to infer plausible continent-wide diversity gradients at a spatial resolution fine enough to directly inform conservation policies and to open up new avenues in macroecological research.

We tested the performance of experimentally sown annual flower strips specifically designed to promote natural enemies of aphids and their pest control services (tailored flower strips) in adjacent potato crops (n=8) compared with control fields (n=10). Flower strips consisted of 11 plant species providing abundant floral and extra-floral resources. The abundance of key natural enemies of aphids (hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds) and hoverfly species richness was greatly enhanced in tailored flower strips compared with potato control strips. This resulted in an average increase in the number of eggs deposited by hoverflies and lacewings by 127% and 48%, respectively, and a reduction in the number of aphids by 75% in adjacent potato crops.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that tailored flower strips can be an effective agri-environmental measure to enhance natural enemies and aphid control in nearby crops. Indeed, tailored flower strips may help to reduce insecticide input in potato production as they significantly decrease the probability that action thresholds are reached. Promoting natural enemy abundance and diversity, as observed for hoverflies, may increase the stability of pest control and provide additional benefits to agro-ecosystems in terms of natural enemy conservation. We thus recommend establishing tailored flower strips as a promising management option to reconcile the objectives of ecological intensification and biodiversity conservation.",2016

When faced with nutritionally diverse resources, or when foraging for offspring with divergent nutritional needs, animals must meet the challenge of how to structure their foraging bouts, including what resources to forage for and in what order (how) to collect them. We investigated how nutritional variation in resources and requirements shapes the structure of bumble bee foraging bouts. Bumble bee workers collect 2 nutritionally distinct resources for consumers with different nutritional needs, floral nectar (largely carbohydrates) for their own needs and that of larvae, and pollen (largely protein) that is used primarily by larvae. We maintained colonies of the Eastern Bumble Bee (Bombus impatiens) in the laboratory on either protein-rich or protein-limited diets and assessed bees' foraging bout structure on artificial flowers that offered low, medium, or high ratios of pollen to nectar. We analyzed bout structure using both traditional floral constancy metrics as well as hierarchical Bayesian analyses. Bees from pollen-satiated colonies responded to variation in floral pollen: nectar ratios, tending to collect pollen consecutively when nectar volumes were high. In contrast, foragers from pollen-limited colonies were relatively insensitive to floral reward ratio, tending to collect pollen in long runs regardless of nectar volume. We discuss the implications of these findings for the pollination services that bees provide plants.",2016
"Temporal dynamics influenced by global change: bee community phenology in urban, agricultural, and natural landscapes",agricultural; bees; ecosystem services; land-use change; phenology; pollinators; seasonality; species distributions; urban ecology,FORAGING RANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT-ISLAND; PLANTS; POLLINATORS; ECOSYSTEMS; HABITAT; WORLD; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION,"Urbanization and agricultural intensification of landscapes are important drivers of global change, which in turn have direct impacts on local ecological communities leading to shifts in species distributions and interactions. Here, we illustrate how human-altered landscapes, with novel ornamental and crop plant communities, result not only in changes to local community diversity of floral-dependent species, but also in shifts in seasonal abundance of bee pollinators. Three years of data on the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that depend on them. Changes in phenology of interactions can be an important, though frequently overlooked, mechanism of global change.",2016
Predicting bee community responses to land-use changes: Effects of geographic and taxonomic biases,,BOMBUS SPP. HYMENOPTERA; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; SPECIES RICHNESS; POLLINATOR DECLINES; DIVERSITY HYMENOPTERA; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; USE INTENSIFICATION; ECOLOGICAL TRAITS; WILD POLLINATORS; FORAGING RANGE,"Land-use change and intensification threaten bee populations worldwide, imperilling pollination services. Global models are needed to better characterise, project, and mitigate bees' responses to these human impacts. The available data are, however, geographically and taxonomically unrepresentative; most data are from North America and Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees and raising concerns that model results may not be generalizable to other regions and taxa. To assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America; Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa) and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses highlight strong regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness and Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity of species and potentially in the nature of threats. These results suggest that global extrapolation of models based on geographically and taxonomically restricted data may underestimate the true uncertainty, increasing the risk of ecological surprises.",2016
Anchored enrichment dataset for true flies (order Diptera) reveals insights into the phylogeny of flower flies (family Syrphidae),Anchored phylogenetics; Hybrid enrichment; Syrphinae; Microdontinae; Eristalinae; Pipizinae; Flower flies; Hoverflies,OBLIGATE PREDATOR; CHEMICAL MIMICRY; POLLINATION; SYSTEMATICS; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; HISTORY; LARVAL; CLASSIFICATION; MICRODONTINAE,"Background: Anchored hybrid enrichment is a form of next-generation sequencing that uses oligonucleotide probes to target conserved regions of the genome flanked by less conserved regions in order to acquire data useful for phylogenetic inference from a broad range of taxa. Once a probe kit is developed, anchored hybrid enrichment is superior to traditional PCR-based Sanger sequencing in terms of both the amount of genomic data that can be recovered and effective cost. Due to their incredibly diverse nature, importance as pollinators, and historical instability with regard to subfamilial and tribal classification, Syrphidae (flower flies or hoverflies) are an ideal candidate for anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogenetics, especially since recent molecular phylogenies of the syrphids using only a few markers have resulted in highly unresolved topologies. Over 6200 syrphids are currently known and uncovering their phylogeny will help us to understand how these species have diversified, providing insight into an array of ecological processes, from the development of adult mimicry, the origin of adult migration, to pollination patterns and the evolution of larval resource utilization. Results: We present the first use of anchored hybrid enrichment in insect phylogenetics on a dataset containing 30 flower fly species from across all four subfamilies and 11 tribes out of 15. To produce a phylogenetic hypothesis, 559 loci were sampled to produce a final dataset containing 217,702 sites. We recovered a well resolved topology with bootstrap support values that were almost universally >95 %. The subfamily Eristalinae is recovered as paraphyletic, with the strongest support for this hypothesis to date. The ant predators in the Microdontinae are sister to all other syrphids. Syrphinae and Pipizinae are monophyletic and sister to each other. Larval predation on soft-bodied hemipterans evolved only once in this family. Conclusions: Anchored hybrid enrichment was successful in producing a robustly supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the syrphids. Subfamilial reconstruction is concordant with recent phylogenetic hypotheses, but with much higher support values. With the newly designed probe kit this analysis could be rapidly expanded with further sampling, opening the door to more comprehensive analyses targeting problem areas in syrphid phylogenetics and ecology.",2016

Some regions in South America, and especially the Pampas, are amongst those parts of the world where stressors of bee populations have been little studied. The Pampas has been intensively transformed for agriculture, being presently one of the most productive areas of agricultural commodities in the world. Here, we aim to provide first insights on the taxonomic and functional composition of bee assemblages in the Rolling Pampa, the most intensively managed part of the Pampas. Soybean (herbicide-tolerant genetically modified varieties) is the predominant crop in this region. Bees were sampled with coloured pan traps. Sampling points were located on field margins in either the cropped or the semi-natural grassland area of a farmland site devoted to annual cropping. A total of 2384 individuals were caught, representing 33 taxa [mainly (morpho)species]. The subgenus Lasioglossum (Dialictus) largely dominated captures (78% of the total abundance) and was relatively abundant in the entire study area, suggesting that some species are likely to reach their ecological requirements in cropped areas. No-till fields and field margins may provide large areas for these below-ground nesting species, while their polylectic food preferences allow them to collect pollen on a wide range of plant species, among them possibly soybean. On the contrary, the richness and the abundance of other taxa were higher in the semi-natural area than in the cropped area. Among them, above-ground nesting or oil-collecting species, which have more specialised nesting and floral requirements, were highly associated with the semi-natural area. Our findings highlight the large dominance of L. (Dialictus) species in this highly intensively managed landscape, and the urgent need of preserving semi-natural habitats to maintain species-rich and functionally diverse bee communities in the Pampas.",2016

These small-scale urban spaces carry potential for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and beyond cities. However, domestic gardening and residential garden designs are often guided by aesthetics and ease more than by the aim to create habitat and biological diversity. Yard-management decisions impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time. Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale 'Wildlife Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider environment. In this paper a pilot assessment is presented of the contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix (Arizona) and Maastricht (The Netherlands) to biodiversity, ecosystem services and sustainability by applying the BIMBY (Biodiversity in My (Back) Yard) framework.",2016
Deforestation Impacts on Bat Functional Diversity in Tropical Landscapes,,SPECIES RICHNESS; COMMUNITY-LEVEL; EASTERN MEXICO; LAND-USE; FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; RESPONSES; CONSERVATION; ASSEMBLAGES; CONFIGURATION,"Functional diversity is the variability in the functional roles carried out by species within ecosystems. Changes in the environment can affect this component of biodiversity and can, in turn, affect different processes, including some ecosystem services. This study aimed to determine the effect of forest loss on species richness, abundance and functional diversity of Neotropical bats. To this end, we identified six landscapes with increasing loss of forest cover in the Huasteca region of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. We captured bats in each landscape using mist nets, and calculated functional diversity indices (functional richness and functional evenness) along with species richness and abundance. We analyzed these measures in terms of percent forest cover. We captured 906 bats (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae), including 10 genera and 12 species. Species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are positively related with forest cover. Generalized linear models show that species richness, abundance and functional richness per night are significantly related with forest cover, while seasonality had an effect on abundance and functional richness. Neither forest cover nor season had a significant effect on functional evenness. All these findings were consistent across three spatial scales (1, 3 and 5 km radius around sampling sites). The decrease in species, abundance and functional richness of bats with forest loss may have implications for the ecological processes they carry out such as seed dispersal, pollination and insect predation, among others.",2016

Sampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Robust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions. 2. While the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizeable fraction of the maximum number of interactions I-max among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e. I-max = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, that is life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I < < I-max, resulting in sparse interaction matrices with low connectance. 3. Here I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. Contrary to species inventories, a sizable fraction of non-observed pairwise interactions cannot be sampled, due to biological constraints that forbid their occurrence. 4. Reasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Adequately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that forbidden links can be accounted for as a portion of the unobserved links when addressing sampling effort. 5. Recent implementations of inference methods for unobserved species or for individual-based data can be combined with the assessment of forbidden links. This can help in estimating their relative importance, simply by the difference between the asymptotic estimate of interaction richness in a robustly sampled assemblage and the maximum richness Imax of interactions. This is crucial to assess the rapid and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.",2016

However, this has occurred largely in parallel to the mainstream studies of cities as ecosystems. This paper aims to conceptually bridge these two distinctive fields of research, by (a) identifying the common aspects between them; (b) identifying key characteristics of urban ecosystems that can be derived from energy and material flow analysis, namely energy and material budget and pathways; flow intensity; energy and material efficiency; rate of resource depletion, accumulation and transformation; self-sufficiency or external dependency; intra-system heterogeneity; intersystem and temporal variation; and regulating mechanism and governing capacity. I argue that significant ecological insight can be, or has the potential to be, drawn from the rich and rapidly growing empirical findings of urban metabolism studies to understand the behaviour of cities as human-dominated, complex systems. A closer intellectual linkage and cross pollination between urban metabolism and urban ecosystem studies will advance our scientific understanding and better inform urban policy and management practices.",2016
Stability and generalization in seed dispersal networks: a case study of frugivorous fish in Neotropical wetlands,functional redundancy; network modularity; nestedness; frugivorous fish; specialization; robustness,POLLINATION NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; NESTEDNESS; MODULARITY; BRAZIL; TREE; SPECIALIZATION; CONSUMPTION; HABITATS; WATERS,"When species within guilds perform similar ecological roles, functional redundancy can buffer ecosystems against species loss. Using data on the frequency of interactions between fish and fruit, we assessed whether co-occurring frugivores provide redundant seed dispersal services in three species-rich Neotropical wetlands. Our study revealed that frugivorous fishes have generalized diets; however, large-bodied fishes had greater seed dispersal breadth than small species, in some cases, providing seed dispersal services not achieved by smaller fish species. As overfishing disproportionately affects big fishes, the extirpation of these species could cause larger secondary extinctions of plant species than the loss of small specialist frugivores. To evaluate the consequences of frugivore specialization for network stability, we extracted data from 39 published seed dispersal networks of frugivorous birds, mammals and fish (our networks) across ecosystems. Our analysis of interaction frequencies revealed low frugivore specialization and lower nestedness than analyses based on binary data (presence absence of interactions). In that case, ecosystems may be resilient to loss of any given frugivore. However, robustness to frugivore extinction declines with specialization, such that networks composed primarily of specialist frugivores are highly susceptible to the loss of generalists. In contrast with analyses of binary data, recently developed algorithms capable of modelling interaction strengths provide opportunities to enhance our understanding of complex ecological networks by accounting for heterogeneity of frugivore fruit interactions.",2016
Temporal changes in the structure of a plant-frugivore network are influenced by bird migration and fruit availability,Frugivory; Interactions network; Migratory birds; Seed dispersal; Fruit availability; Temporal,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SPECIES INTERACTION NETWORKS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; POLLINATION NETWORK; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BODY-SIZE; ABUNDANCE; NESTEDNESS; PATTERNS; FOREST,"Background. Ecological communities are dynamic collections whose composition and structure change over time, making up complex interspecific interaction networks. Mutualistic plant-animal networks can be approached through complex network analysis; these networks are characterized by a nested structure consisting of a core of generalist species, which endows the network with stability and robustness against disturbance. Those mutualistic network structures can vary as a consequence of seasonal fluctuations and food availability, as well as the arrival of new species into the system that might disorder the mutualistic network structure (e.g., a decrease in nested pattern). However, there is no assessment on how the arrival of migratory species into seasonal tropical systems can modify such patterns. Emergent and fine structural temporal patterns are adressed here for the first time for plant-frugivorous bird networks in a highly seasonal tropical environment. Methods. In a plant-frugivorous bird community, we analyzed the temporal turnover of bird species comprising the network core and periphery of ten temporal interaction networks resulting from different bird migration periods. Additionally, we evaluated how fruit abundance and richness, as well as the arrival of migratory birds into the system, explained the temporal changes in network parameters such as network size, connectance, nestedness, specialization, interaction strength asymmetry and niche overlap. The analysis included data from 10 quantitative plant-frugivorous bird networks registered from November 2013 to November 2014. Results. We registered a total of 319 interactions between 42 plant species and 44 frugivorous bird species; only ten bird species were part of the network core. We witnessed a noteworthy turnover of the species comprising the network periphery during migration periods, as opposed to the network core, which did not show significant temporal changes in species composition. Our results revealed that migration and fruit richness explain the temporal variations in network size, connectance, nestedness and interaction strength asymmetry. On the other hand, fruit abundance only explained connectance and nestedness. Discussion. By means of a fine-resolution temporal analysis, we evidenced for the first time how temporal changes in the interaction network structure respond to the arrival of migratory species into the system and to fruit availability. Additionally, few migratory bird species are important links for structuring networks, while most of them were peripheral species. We showed the relevance of studying bird-plant interactions at fine temporal scales, considering changing scenarios of species composition with a quantitative network approach.",2016

To date, however, there has been no comprehensive global investigation of these hypotheses.Aims: Investigating a range of hypotheses for the role of biotic and abiotic factors as determinants of the global variation in animal vs. wind pollination.Methods: We analysed 67 plant communities ranging from 70o north to 34o south. For these we determined habitat type, species richness, insularity, topographic heterogeneity, current climate and late-quaternary climate change. The predictive effects of these factors on the proportion of wind- and animal-pollinated plants were tested using correlations, ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression analyses with information-theoretic model selection.Results: The proportion of animal-pollinated plant species was positively associated with plant species richness and current temperature. Furthermore, in forest, animal pollination was positively related to precipitation. Historical climate was only weakly and idiosyncratically correlated with animal pollination.Conclusion: Results were consistent with the hypothesised reduced chance for wind-transported pollen reaching conspecific flowers in species-rich communities, fewer constraints on nectar production in warm and wet habitats, and reduced relative effectiveness of wind dispersal in humid areas. There was little evidence of a legacy of historical climate change affecting these patterns.",2016
A new model for ecological networks using species-level traits,complementary traits; Dirichlet-multinomial regression; forbidden links; interaction probabilities; linkage rules; network structure; pollen transfer network; pollination webs,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; BODY-SIZE; MULTINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PATTERNS; BEES; SPECIALIZATION; RESPONSES; PREDICT,"Recent studies on plant-pollinator networks have focused on explaining network structure through linkage rules, including spatio-temporal overlap, and phenotypic trait or phylogenetic signal complementarity. Few studies, however, have quantified the extent to which functional traits affect the probability of plants and pollinators interacting with each other. Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression is a consumer-resource model for the interaction probabilities in a mutualistic network. This flexible model accommodates network heterogeneity through random effects and overdispersion and can estimate the contribution of species-level traits to plant-pollinator interactions. Using artificial networks based on linkage rules and neutrality, we evaluate the performance of DM regression and explore the model's parameter space. We also analyse an empirical network in which the interaction probabilities are modelled by species characteristics. Study results show that such random effects models can provide good fits to observed data. The characteristics pollinators seek in plant species may be better anticipated if species interactions are modelled by the functional traits that drive them.",2016
Inter-assemblage facilitation: the functional diversity of cavity-producing beetles drives the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees,Cavity nesting bees; community assembly; community ecology; facilitation; functional diversity; functional traits; pollinators; wild bees; wood boring beetles,ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; SAPROXYLIC BEETLES; NATURAL ENEMIES; FORAGING RANGES; SOLITARY BEES; BODY-SIZE; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY; TRAITS,"Inter-specific interactions are important drivers and maintainers of biodiversity. Compared to trophic and competitive interactions, the role of non-trophic facilitation among species has received less attention. Cavity-nesting bees nest in old beetle borings in dead wood, with restricted diameters corresponding to the body size of the bee species. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the functional diversity of cavity-producing wood boring beetles - in terms of cavity diameters - drives the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees. The invertebrate communities were sampled in 30 sites, located in forested landscapes along an elevational gradient. We regressed the species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles, non-wood boring beetles and elevation. The proportion of cavity nesting bees in bee species assemblage was regressed against the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. We also tested the relationships between the size diversity of cavity nesting bees and wood boring beetles. The species richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees increased with the species richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. No such relationship was found for non-wood boring beetles. The abundance of wood boring beetles was also related to an increased proportion of cavity nesting bee individuals. Moreover, the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees increased with the functional diversity of wood boring beetles. Specifically, the mean and dispersion of bee body sizes increased with the functional dispersion of large wood boring beetles. The positive relationships between cavity producing bees and cavity nesting bees suggest that non-trophic facilitative interactions between species assemblages play important roles in organizing bee species assemblages. Considering a community-wide approach may therefore be required if we are to successfully understand and conserve wild bee species assemblages in forested landscapes.",2016

This is an important gap because feedbacks to the atmosphere may change as future O-3 levels increase or decrease, depending on air quality and climate policies. Global simulation of O-3 using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) revealed that in 2000, about 40% of the Global 200 terrestrial ecoregions (ER) were exposed to O-3 above thresholds for ecological risks, with highest exposures in North America and Southern Europe, where there is field evidence of adverse effects of O-3, and in central Asia. Experimental studies show that O-3 can adversely affect the growth and flowering of plants and alter species composition and richness, although some communities can be resilient. Additional effects include changes in water flux regulation, pollination efficiency, and plant pathogen development. Recent research is unraveling a range of effects below-ground, including changes in soil invertebrates, plant litter quantity and quality, decomposition, and nutrient cycling and carbon pools. Changes are likely slow and may take decades to become detectable. CESM simulations for 2050 show that O-3 exposure under emission scenario RCP8.5 increases in all major biomes and that policies represented in scenario RCP4.5 do not lead to a general reduction in O-3 risks; rather, 50% of ERs still show an increase in exposure. Although a conceptual model is lacking to extrapolate documented effects to ERs with limited or no local information, and there is uncertainty about interactions with nitrogen input and climate change, the analysis suggests that in many ERs, O-3 risks will persist for biodiversity at different trophic levels, and for a range of ecosystem processes and feedbacks, which deserves more attention when assessing ecological implications of future atmospheric pollution and climate change.",2016
Effects of agricultural fungicides on microorganisms associated with floral nectar: susceptibility assays and field experiments,Fungicides; Pollination; Nectar; Microorganisms; Metschnikowia; Acinetobacter,NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; HONEY-BEES; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY; FITNESS; YEASTS; HERB,"Pesticides have become an inseparable element of agricultural intensification. While the direct impact of pesticides on non-target organisms, such as pollinators, has recently received much attention, less consideration has been given to the microorganisms that are associated with them. Specialist yeasts and bacteria are known to commonly inhabit floral nectar and change its chemical characteristics in numerous ways, possibly influencing pollinator attraction. In this study, we investigated the in vitro susceptibility of nectar yeasts Metschnikowia gruessi, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and Candida bombi to six widely used agricultural fungicides (prothioconazole, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin, fenamidone, boscalid, and fluopyram). Next, a commercial antifungal mixture containing tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin was applied to natural populations of the plant Linaria vulgaris and the occurrence, abundance, and diversity of nectar-inhabiting yeasts and bacteria was compared between treated and untreated plants. The results showed that prothioconazole and tebuconazole were highly toxic to nectar yeasts, inhibiting their growth at concentrations varying between 0.06 and 0.5 mg/L. Azoxystrobin, fenamidone, boscalid, and fluopyram on the other hand exhibited considerably lower toxicity, inhibiting yeast growth at concentrations between 1 and 32 mg/L or in many cases not inhibiting microbial growth at all. The application of the antifungal mixture in natural plant populations resulted in a significant decrease in the occurrence and abundance of yeasts in individual flowers, but this did not translate into noticeable changes in bacterial incidence and abundance. Yeast and bacterial species richness and distribution did not also differ between treated and untreated plants. We conclude that the application of fungicides may have negative effects on the abundance of nectar yeasts in floral nectar. The consequences of these effects on plant pollination processes in agricultural systems warrant further investigation.",2016

The aim of this study was to understand how urbanization affects wild bee assemblages along a gradient of impervious surfaces and to determine the influence of landscape composition and floral resource availability on these assemblages. We chose 12 sites with a proportion of impervious surfaces (soil covered by parking, roads, and buildings) ranging from 0.06% to 64.31% within a 500m radius. We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages.",2016
Pollination Mode and Mating System Explain Patterns in Genetic Differentiation in Neotropical Plants,,LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; LINEAR MIXED MODELS; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; RELATIVE RATES; POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; CHLOROPLAST; ECOLOGY; NUCLEAR,"We studied genetic diversity and differentiation patterns in Neotropical plants to address effects of life history traits (LHT) and ecological attributes based on an exhaustive literature survey. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test the effects as fixed and random factors of growth form, pollination and dispersal modes, mating and breeding systems, geographical range and habitat on patterns of genetic diversity (HS, HeS, p and h), inbreeding coefficient (FIS), allelic richness (AR) and differentiation among populations (FST) for both nuclear and chloroplast genomes. In addition, we used phylogenetic generalized least squares (pGLS) to account for phylogenetic independence on predictor variables and verify the robustness of the results from significant GLMMs. In general, GLMM revealed more significant relationships among LHTs and genetic patterns than pGLS. After accounting for phylogenetic independence (i.e., using pGLS), FST for nuclear microsatellites was significantly related to pollination mode, mating system and habitat. Plants specifically with outcrossing mating system had lower FST. Moreover, AR was significantly related to pollination mode and geographical range and HeS for nuclear dominant markers was significantly related to habitat. Our findings showed that different results might be retrieved when phylogenetic non-independence is taken into account and that LHTs and ecological attributes affect substantially the genetic pattern in Neotropical plants, hence may drive key evolutionary processes in plants.",2016

Though cotton may potentially benefit from animal mediated pollination, it is unknown if the species is indeed pollen limited across agroecological landscapes. Our study had three objectives: (1) identify the land use attributes that impact wild pollinator abundance and diversity, (2) investigate the relationship between pollinator community composition and cotton pollen limitation and (3) determine the extent of direct and indirect effects of land use on pollinator community composition and pollination service. To address these objectives, we used a combination of pollinator community surveys, GIS analysis, and pollen limitation experiments across 12 cotton landscapes in South Texas. Overall, we found that pollinator community composition was closely related to the abundance of natural areas (250 m radius). We also found evidence of substantial cotton pollen limitation, as significantly larger bolls were produced with the addition of outcross pollen. Further, we reveal that pollen limitation was negatively correlated with pollinator abundance and richness. Path analysis confirmed the two direct effects of land use composition on pollinator community and pollinator community composition on pollen limitation. Overall, our results reveal potential for increased crop yields via wild pollinator-mediated fruit set, equivalent to more than $108/acre with a regional gain of over $1.1 million USD. Further, our research provides insight into the specific land management practices that support pollinator communities within cotton agroecosystems. Cotton landscapes that maintain natural areas promote wild pollinator abundance and diversity, and subsequently experience reduced pollination limitation and increased crop yields.    ",2016
Testing for functional convergence of temperate rainforest tree assemblages in Chile and New Zealand,Bioclimatic matching; environmental filtering; functional trait convergence; leaf dry matter content; leaf economics; leaf habit; leaf size; pollination syndrome; seed mass; wood density,MEDITERRANEAN-CLIMATE ECOSYSTEMS; LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; DRY-MATTER CONTENT; SHADE TOLERANCE; TROPICAL TREES; WOOD DENSITY; TRADE-OFF; LEAF-AREA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; DISPERSAL SYNDROMES,"An important tenet of biogeography and comparative ecology is that disjunct assemblages in similar physical environments are functionally more similar to each other than to assemblages from other environments. Temperate rainforests in South America, New Zealand and Australia share certain physiognomic similarities, but we are not aware of any statistical evidence that these disjunct plant assemblages share a distinctive suite of functional traits, or trait combinations. We compiled height, leaf, wood and reproductive traits from the 25 commonest arborescent species at Chilean and New Zealand sites matched for summer rainfall, summer maximum temperatures, and winter minimum temperatures. We then used multivariate tests of trait convergence. Tropical and subtropical assemblages served as out-groups. PERMANOVA showed convergence of trait centroids at the two temperate sites, where trees on average had denser wood and smaller leaves than trees at the (sub)tropical sites. Principal components analyses carried out separately on each assemblage showed that the Chilean and New Zealand assemblages were also the most similar pair in terms of trait relationships, although New Zealand also shared strong similarities with subtropical Argentina. The main axis of variation in both temperate assemblages ranged from small, short-lived understorey trees with soft leaves, to emergents with sclerophyllous leaves and fairly dense wood. However, the New Zealand assemblage was much richer in small trees with soft leaves than its Chilean counterpart; possible historical influences on this difference include conditions favouring radiation of small trees during the late Neogene in New Zealand, competition from Chusquea bamboos in Chile and the historical absence of browsing mammals from New Zealand. Environmental filtering has produced similar values of individual traits in Chile and New Zealand, but only partial convergence of functional trait combinations. As far as we know, this is the first study to statistically test whether disjunct tree assemblages on climatically matched sites are more functionally similar to each other than to assemblages from other environments.",2016

However, nectar-feeding bats do not exhibit preferences for the sugars present in their diet. We analyzed the role that biochemical and ecological factors could play in shaping the nectar traits of chiropterophilic plants. We studied nectar traits and flower production in 49 plant species. We evaluated the relationship between nectar concentration and sugar composition using phylogenetically independent contrasts and if nectar traits were related to flower production using a Manova. We found that 42 species produced high hexoses nectars, and 7 species produced sucrose rich nectars. Phylogenetically independent contrasts showed that nectar concentration was negatively related to glucose content, positively related to fructose content, and was not related to sucrose content. A negative relationship was found from glucose and fructose contents to sucrose content, and glucose content was negatively related to fructose content. Finally, we did not found any relationship between nectar traits and the plants' flowering strategies. We conclude that bat physiology and the relative low evolutionary time of the interaction between plants and bats may determine the lack of pattern in the nectar characteristics of chiropterophilic plants.",2016

As such, they are central players in most of the major biomes of the world, notably the tropics where they display an enormous species richness and range of specialisations, although they are largely absent from high polar and marine ecosystems. Because of their abundance and diversity, they often come into direct competition with humans, as pests threatening our crops and stored products, attacking our clothes and paper products, including books, and as vectors transmitting diseases, some deadly, to ourselves, livestock, crops, and to wildlife. Meanwhile, many species are highly beneficial as pollinators and as biological control agents used to protect our crops and products. Others still are of conservation importance. For centuries, pest species have been combatted using a variety of approaches, mainly chemical during the 19th into the 21st centuries, but problems have arisen due to the evolution of insecticide resistance. Resistance has even recently evolved against such novel bio-pesticides as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner) toxins. This is perhaps not surprising considering the often short life cycles of many pest insects, their powers of dispersal, and ability to adapt and evolve in the face of novel ecological challenges. Humankind has responded by developing strategies, including the use of natural biological control agents. Mark Jervis was an expert on the deployment of these agents, especially parasitic Hymenoptera, in the control of insect pests, both from a theoretical and applied standpoint. Here, I briefly outline, with special reference to the UK, how cutbacks in research funding threaten the vital entomological research base, while highlighting some of the main ways pest insect populations have been, and are being, studied and controlled. Last, as Mark was a keen, long-term Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, I also outline the role of the Society in advancing the understanding and dissemination of insect science to a national and international audience.",2016
Electromagnetic radiation of mobile telecommunication antennas affects the abundance and composition of wild pollinators,Bee flies; Beetles; Butterflies; Distance to the antenna; Electromagnetic smog; EMR; Hoverflies; Species richness; Wasps; Wild bees,DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; TELEPHONY RADIATION; PHONE RADIATION; GSM 900-MHZ; FIELDS; RADIOFREQUENCY; EXPOSURE; MAGNETORECEPTION; CONSERVATION; REPRODUCTION,"The exponential increase of mobile telephony has led to a pronounced increase in electromagnetic fields in the environment that may affect pollinator communities and threaten pollination as a key ecosystem service. Previous studies conducted on model species under laboratory conditions have shown negative effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on reproductive success, development, and navigation of insects. However, the potential effects that widespread mobile telecommunication antennas have on wild pollinator communities outside the laboratory microcosm are still unknown. Here we studied the effects of EMR from telecommunication antennas on key wild pollinator groups (wild bees, hoverflies, bee flies, remaining flies, beetles, butterflies, and wasps). We measured EMR at 4 distances (50, 100, 200 and 400 m) from 10 antennas (5 on Limnos Island and 5 on Lesvos Island, eastern Mediterranean, Greece), and correlated EMR values with insect abundance and richness (the latter only for wild bees and hoverflies). All pollinator groups except butterflies were affected by EMR. In both islands, beetle, wasp, and hoverfly abundance decreased with EMR, whereas the abundance of underground-nesting wild bees and bee flies unexpectedly increased with EMR. The effect of EMR on the abundance of remaining flies differed between islands. With respect to species richness, EMR only tended to have a negative effect on hoverflies in Limnos. As EMR affected the abundance of several insect guilds negatively, and changed the composition of wild pollinators in natural habitats, it might also have additional ecological and economic impacts on the maintenance of wild plant diversity, crop production and human welfare.",2016
Microbial diversity in the floral nectar of Linaria vulgaris along an urbanization gradient,Nectar yeasts; Urbanization; Metschnikowia; Acinetobacter; Nestedness; Nectar microbial communities; Linaria vulgaris,YEAST COMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS; INHABITING YEASTS; SP NOV.; PLANT; FLOWERS; SCROPHULARIACEAE; RICHNESS; BACTERIA; ECOLOGY,"Background: Microbes are common inhabitants of floral nectar and are capable of influencing plant-pollinator interactions. All studies so far investigated microbial communities in floral nectar in plant populations that were located in natural environments, but nothing is known about these communities in nectar of plants inhabiting urban environments. However, at least some microbes are vectored into floral nectar by pollinators, and because urbanization can have a profound impact on pollinator communities and plant-pollinator interactions, it can be expected that it affects nectar microbes as well. To test this hypothesis, we related microbial diversity in floral nectar to the degree of urbanization in the late-flowering plant Linaria vulgaris. Floral nectar was collected from twenty populations along an urbanization gradient and culturable bacteria and yeasts were isolated and identified by partially sequencing the genes coding for small and large ribosome subunits, respectively. Results: A total of seven yeast and 13 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found at 3 and 1 % sequence dissimilarity cut-offs, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, Metschnikowia reukaufii and M. gruessi were the main yeast constituents of nectar yeast communities, whereas Acinetobacter nectaris and Rosenbergiella epipactidis were the most frequently found bacterial species. Microbial incidence was high and did not change along the investigated urbanization gradient. However, microbial communities showed a nested subset structure, indicating that species-poor communities were a subset of species-rich communities. Conclusions: The level of urbanization was putatively identified as an important driver of nestedness, suggesting that environmental changes related to urbanization may impact microbial communities in floral nectar of plants growing in urban environments.",2016
From glacial refugia to wide distribution range: demographic expansion of Loropetalum chinense (Hamamelidaceae) in Chinese subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest,Widespread species; Phylogeography; Postglacial history; Evergreen broadleaved forest,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL DNA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; THRIPS POLLINATION; CHLOROPLAST DNA; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; UNIVERSAL PRIMERS; AFLP MARKERS; ICE AGES,"The subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest (STEBF) in China is globally one of the most diverse and biologically important forest systems. There has been a long-term debate whether this region was affected dramatically during Pleistocene glaciation and deglaciation cycles, e.g., in terms of range dimensions and changes in species richness. Here we report a large-scale phylogeographic study, focusing on a widespread and typical constituent species of the Chinese STEBF, Loropetalum chinense (R. Br.) Oliver (Hamamelidaceae). In total, 56 populations spanning the entire distribution range of L. chinense were analyzed. Chloroplast DNA sequence variation and AFLPs as molecular marker systems were used in combination with ecological niche modeling (ENM). ENM indicated that the distribution ranges of L. chinense were contracted remarkably and most populations retreated southward. Thereby, based on ENM, geographical distribution pattern of cpDNA haplotypes, and AFLP genetic clusters, one glacial refuge was inferred in the Nanling Mountains in southern China, and a second glacial refuge was identified in Three Gorges Area and Dabashan Mountains in Chongqing Province, southwestern China. In addition to ENM, with mismatch distribution analysis and Bayesian skyline plots, demographic expansion was inferred to take place about 10.6 kya. The current geographic distribution pattern of genetic variation might be shaped by northward and eastward expansion along Nanling Mountains and Wuyishan Mountains, respectively. Additionally, the two mountain ranges were supposed to act as geographical barriers restricting gene flow between the southern and northern populations. Herewith, we aim to further contribute a case study of the phylogeographic history of this vegetation type, which will help to improve deeper understanding of past vegetation dynamics and floristic evolutionary pathways of the Chinese STEBF.",2016

They are rare structures in angiosperms; in Fabaceae, they have been recorded in only seven genera, including Bauhinia s. s. Because B. curvula and B. rufa exhibit glands that are responsible for attracting pollinators to flowers, this study aimed to test whether the cavitated secretory trichomes present in the flowers of these species have an attraction function. As leaf trichomes are commonly related to plant defence, comparative analyses of the morphology, ontogeny, ultrastructure and chemical profile of the secretory trichomes present in flowers and leaves were conducted. It was found that cavitated secretory trichomes are similar in their external morphology and development, regardless of the organ or species analysed. However, interspecific differences were found in the secretion process and chemical profile of the exudate. The differences found in the cavitated secretory trichomes between species indicate that they secrete distinct compounds, whereas the similarities found in these structures between vegetative and reproductive organs indicate that the cavitated trichomes have equivalent ecological functions within a species, probably in plant defence during organ development.",2016

We aimed to investigate floral mechanisms underlying the interaction with pollinators in two hummingbird-pollinated orchids occurring in the Atlantic forest. We assessed floral biology, nectar traits, nectary and column micromorphologies, breeding systems and pollinators. In both species, nectar is secreted by lip calli through spaces between the medial lamellar surfaces of epidermal cells. Such a form of floral nectar secretion has not been previously described. Both species present functional protandry and are self-compatible yet pollinator-dependent. Fruit set in hand-pollination experiments was more than twice that under natural conditions, evidencing pollen limitation. The absence of fruit set in interspecific crosses suggests the existence of post-pollination barriers between these sympatric co-flowering species. In Elleanthus brasiliensis, fruits resulting from cross-pollination and natural conditions were heavier than those resulting from self-pollination, suggesting advantages to cross-pollination. Hummingbirds pollinated both species, which share at least one pollinator species. Species differences in floral morphologies led to distinct pollination mechanisms. In E. brasiliensis, attachment of pollinarium to the hummingbird bill occurs through a lever apparatus formed by an appendage in the column, another novelty to our knowledge of orchid pollination. In E. crinipes, pollinarium attachment occurs by simple contact with the bill during insertion into the flower tube, which fits tightly around it. The novelties described here illustrate the overlooked richness in ecology and morphophysiology in Orchidaceae.",2016
Woody climbers show greater population genetic differentiation than trees: Insights into the link between ecological traits and diversification,Phi(ST); evolutionary innovations; genetic diversity; isolation by distance; lianas; population differentiation,TEMPERATE RAIN-FOREST; DARWINS ABOMINABLE MYSTERY; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; FLOWERING PLANTS; NATURAL-SELECTION; SPECIES RICHNESS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; CLIMBING PLANTS; KEY INNOVATIONS,"The climbing habit is a key innovation in plants: climbing taxa have higher species richness than nonclimbing sister groups. We evaluated the hypothesis that climbing plant species show greater among-population genetic differentiation than nonclimber species. We compared the among-population genetic distance in woody climbers (eight species, 30 populations) and trees (seven species, 29 populations) coexisting in nine communities in a temperate rainforest. We also compared within-population genetic diversity in co-occurring woody climbers and trees in two communities. Mean genetic distance between populations of climbers was twice that of trees. Isolation by distance (increase in genetic distance with geographic distance) was greater for climbers. Climbers and trees showed similar within-population genetic diversity. Our longevity estimate suggested that climbers had shorter generation times, while other biological features often associated with diversification (dispersal and pollination syndromes, mating system, size, and metabolic rate) did not show significant differences between groups. We hypothesize that the greater population differentiation in climbers could result from greater evolutionary responses to local selection acting on initially higher within-population genetic diversity, which could be driven by neutral processes associated with shorter generation times. Increased population genetic differentiation could be incorporated as another line of evidence when testing for key innovations.",2016

Decisions made by urban residents affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial, ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by neighborhood socioeconomics.",2016

We found that species differed strongly in their contributions to the organization of the multi-interaction network, and that only a few species contributed to the structuring of these patterns. Moreover, we observed that the multi-interaction networks did not enhance community robustness compared with each of the three independent mutualistic networks when analysed across a range of simulated scenarios of species extinction. By simulating the removal of highly interacting species, we observed that, overall, these species enhance network nestedness and robustness, but decrease modularity. We discuss how the organization of interlinked mutualistic networks may be essential for the maintenance of ecological communities, and therefore the long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interactive, species-rich communities. We suggest that conserving these keystone mutualists and their interactions is crucial to the persistence of species-rich mutualistic assemblages, mainly because they support other species and shape the network organization.",2016

Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in particular on wild bees remain ambiguous and not comprehensively understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing areas. Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to more than 20% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.",2016
Comparing diversity to flower-bee interaction networks reveals unsuccessful foraging of native bees in disturbed habitats,Bipartite network; Community diversity; Ecological trap; Floral diversity; Land management; Plant-pollinator interactions,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; LAND-USE; SOLITARY BEES; FLORIDA SCRUB; ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SPECIES RICHNESS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; ECOLOGY,"As land is converted to agriculture (e.g., pastures), natural vegetation is repeatedly disturbed, creating various levels of habitat alteration in which flowering plants and pollinators (e.g., bees) interact. Community structure of flowering plants, bees, and flower-bee interactions may each respond to disturbance, but potentially in different ways or magnitudes. We studied flowering plants, bees, and their interactions across four mechanical disturbance levels in and near Archbold Biological Station, Florida (USA) for one year, using repeated sampling with standard techniques in replicated plots. Data were analyzed for community structure, flower-bee interactions and bipartite network structure. Over 7500 flowering plants (81 species) and almost 5000 bees (48 species) were sampled, representing >80% of estimated species richness. Disturbance altered available flower diversity and both shifted and simplified compositions of floral and bee communities. Importantly, the number of foraging bee species did not decrease with disturbance but fewer bee species interacted with flowers given greater disturbance, indicating that disturbance reduced successful foraging. Interaction networks became simpler with disturbance, and the non-native European honey bee (Apis mellifera) became more dominant as disturbance intensity increased. Flower-bee interactions were most sensitive to disturbance. For some native bees, anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to ecological trap conditions and drive long-term diversity patterns. Attention to interaction networks will help land managers identify plant species to conserve and restore flowering plants that are vital to native pollinator communities.  ",2016

The benefits of citizen science for collecting such datasets include the extension of spatial and temporal scales, and cost reduction. In classical citizen science, citizens collect data and send them directly to scientists. This may not be possible for the many biological groups for which specimen identification is difficult and requires high-level expertise. Here we report the results of an expert-assisted citizen science program where teachers from 20 French agricultural high schools collected bees, which were identified to species level by a panel of expert bee taxonomists. Overall the dataset included 70 collections (year x sampling site combinations) that resulted in 4574 specimens belonging to 195 species. We analysed this dataset using data freely available at a national scale on agriculture intensity and landscape composition. We found that species richness increased with increasing proportion of herbaceous semi-natural elements; species dominance decreased with increasing crop diversity; the proportion of above ground nesting species and specimens increased as the intensity of agricultural practices decreased. Comparing the results obtained with identification to species level and those obtained with higher taxa or parataxonomic approaches, we found that the loss of taxonomic resolution resulted in the non-significance of some results on the effects of environmental variables on bee assemblage-level attributes. Our study suggests that identification to species level is of great importance to detect the effects of global change on bees and that an expert-assisted citizen science paradigm could provide relevant results to guide conservation measures at a national scale.",2016

Lawns blanket > 163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50% of urban and suburban areas. When not treated with herbicides, lawns have the capacity to support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards in Springfield, MA, between May and September 2013 and 2014. Householders participating in the study did not apply chemical pesticides or herbicides to lawns for the duration of the study. We collected 5,331 individual bees, representing 111 species, and 29% of bee species reported for the state. The majority of species were native to North America (94.6%), nested in soil (73%), and solitary (48.6%). Species richness was lower for oligolectic (specialists on a single plant; 9.9%) and parasitic species (12.6%). Abundance percentages for number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in the lawns, the majority of which were not intentionally planted. The most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30% of the spontaneous plant species growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests that the spontaneous lawn flowers could be viewed as supplemental floral resources and support pollinators, thereby enhancing the value of urban green spaces.",2016

However, this has rarely been studied in species-rich, tropical plant-pollinator networks. Working in a biodiversity hotspot in the Peruvian Andes we assessed the structure of quantitative plant-pollinator networks in nine valleys, quantifying modularity among networks, defining the topological roles of species and the influence of floral traits on specialization. Methods A total of 90 transects were surveyed for plants and pollinators at different altitudes and across different life zones. Quantitative modularity (QuanBiMo) was used to detect modularity and six indices were used to quantify specialization. Key Results All networks were highly structured, moderately specialized and significantly modular regardless of size. The strongest hubs were Baccharis plants, Apis mellifera, Bombus funebris and Diptera spp., which were the most ubiquitous and abundant species with the longest phenologies. Species strength showed a strong association with the modular structure of plant-pollinator networks. Hubs and connectors were the most centralized participants in the networks and were ranked highest (high generalization) when quantifying specialization with most indices. However, complementary specialization d' quantified hubs and connectors as moderately specialized. Specialization and topological roles of species were remarkably constant across some sites, but highly variable in others. Networks were dominated by ecologically and functionally generalist plant species with open access flowers which are closely related taxonomically with similar morphology and rewards. Plants associated with hummingbirds had the highest level of complementary specialization and exclusivity in modules (functional specialists) and the longest corollas. Conclusions We have demonstrated that the topology of networks in this tropical montane environment was non-random and highly organized. Our findings underline that specialization indices convey different concepts of specialization and hence quantify different aspects, and that measuring specialization requires careful consideration of what defines a specialist.",2016

The value of the resulting forests for biodiversity conservation is widely unknown, particularly in relation to highly diverse invertebrate taxa that fulfil important ecosystem services. We aimed to address this knowledge gap, establishing the conservation value of secondary forests on Dongling Mountain, North China based on the diversity of geometrid moths - a species-rich family of nocturnal pollinators that also influences plant assemblages through caterpillar herbivory. Results showed that secondary forests harboured geometrid moth assemblages similar in species richness and phylogenetic diversity, but with a species composition distinctly different to assemblages in one of China's last remaining mature temperate forests in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve. Species overlap between these sites was about 30%, and species did not form separate phylogenetic clusters according to site. Species assemblages at Dongling Mountain were strongly differentiated according to forest type; a pattern not found at Changbaishan. Our results indicate that protected naturally regenerated secondary forests in northern China provide suitable habitats for species-rich and genetically diverse geometrid moth assemblages, highlighting the potential importance of these forests for conservation and ecosystem function provision across the wider landscape.

For flowering plants, pollinators are often essential for plant reproduction and establishment, and pollinator-mediated interactions may influence plant community composition. Here, we use null models and community phylogenetic analyses of co-occurrence patterns to determine the role of pollinator-mediated processes in structuring plant communities dominated by congeners. We surveyed three species-rich genera (Limnanthes, Mimulus and Clarkia) with centres of diversity in the Sierra Nevada of California. Each genus contains species that co-flower and share pollinators, and each has a robust phylogeny. Within each genus, we surveyed 44-48 communities at three spatial scales, measured floral and vegetative traits and tested for segregation or aggregation of: (i) species, (ii) floral traits (which are likely to be influenced by pollinators), and (iii) vegetative traits (which are likely affected by other environmental factors). We detected both aggregation and segregation of floral traits that were uncorrelated with vegetative trait patterns; we infer that pollinators have shaped the community assembly although the mechanisms may be varied (competition, facilitation, or filtering). We also found that mating system differences may play an important role in allowing species co-occurrence. Together, it appears that pollinators influence community assemblage in these three clades.",2016

Rare plant species in bee diets, and disturbance regimes, have not previously been researched and are emphasized here. Two focal bee groups with one species each (Megachilidae and Apidae) were studied in a 500,000-ha tropical reserve in the Yucatan Peninsula nine complete years. The number of rare or major pollen species in nests had no statistical correlation; thus, rare pollen analysis complements study of major brood provisions. We found most nests (87 % Megachile zaptlana, 93 % Centris analis) contained rare pollen; only 12 % of the 438 nests contained major pollen alone. Rare pollen sometimes indicated an energy source rather than a scarce protein resource. Trichome nectar of Cydista, along with Ipomoea and Caesalpinia, were nectar sources. Malpighiaceae, despite lacking nectar, often provided the complete Centris diet. Considering rare pollen, only Centris responded to drought, or competition from immigrant honeybees. Neither bee responded to hurricanes. Drought years coincided with low bee populations; Centris nests contained more rare species then. After feral Africanized honeybees colonized, Centris had more major species and fewer rare. Some herbarium vouchers from the study area contained exotic pollen, demonstrating in situ floral contamination and ecological generalization by bees, but this rarely occurred in plants found among the bee diets. Megachile and Centris responded differently to competition and resource scarcity, and plausibly evolved under different disturbance regimes, yet appeared well adapted to hurricane disturbance.",2016

Nutrient enrichment is one of the major threats acting on natural communities. The ecological consequences of this disturbance for ecosystems have been largely studied, but we still have little knowledge on its evolutionary effects at community scale. We are interested in the evolutionary consequences of nutrient enrichment for plant interaction traits, embedded in complex communities made of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. 2. We built a mathematical model of a plant-pollinator-herbivore community confronted by nutrient enrichment. Plants have an interaction trait that is involved in an ecological trade-off. An increase in this trait, leading to more attractive phenotypes, increases the strength of both interactions with pollinators and herbivores. A lower value of this trait leads to defensive phenotypes with weak interactions with both herbivores and pollinators. We use the framework of adaptive dynamics to study the evolutionary dynamics of this kind of traits and the consequences for community dynamics. 3. We found that evolutionary dynamics of plants modify the assembly of the community along a nutrient enrichment gradient. Due to top-down controls, herbivory leads to priority effects when only ecological dynamics are considered. Evolution of the plant interaction trait alleviates this priority effect and facilitates community assembly. In the three-species community, we find that nutrient enrichment leads to more defended phenotypes of plants, at the expense of pollinator attraction. 4. We find that, when the ecological trade-off between pollination and herbivory is convex, evolution of interaction trait may lead to plant diversification. Two plant phenotypes then coexist in the community, one which is highly attractive and one which is highly defensive. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that accounting for evolutionary dynamics will profoundly modify the dynamics of communities in the face of nutrient enrichment. Both community assembly and equilibrium dynamics are altered and enrichment may even lead to diversification. These results advocate for the development of an eco-evolutionary theory of nutrient enrichment and may be particularly important in agro-ecosystems relying on fertilization.",2016

Honey bees and blue-banded digger bees feed on pollen and effect only accidental pollination. the nectar is sucrose-rich and contains essential and non-essential amino acids. birds are seed dispersal agents. Seeds are non-dormant and germinate readily but their continued growth and establishment is subject to the availability of soil moisture and nutrients. the plant is not able to populate itself in its natural area. further, the local uses of flowers and leaves of this plant appear to be negatively affecting its reproductive success. P. tomentosa serves as a keystone species for bees and butterflies because this is the only prominent and profuse flowering species during dry season in the study region.",2016

However, when savannas are protected from fire, both fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive plant species increase in density and size, especially species of trees. Nevertheless, how this change in the vegetation structure relates to changes in the ecosystem function has been seldom evaluated. Pollination is a major ecosystem service, and here we aimed to determine possible changes in floristic composition, floral biology, and pollination systems in an area of open savanna protected against fire over a period of 20 years in Minas Gerais state, Central Brazil. The comparison over the two decades showed that ecological succession, in the absence of fire, increased the diversity and decreased the dominance of plant species. There was an increase in specie richness from 156 spp. in 1992 to 206 spp. in 2012, with appearance of trees and species with specialized pollination systems. Plants were predominantly pollinated by bees in both periods, but floral diversity and specialization seem to have increased after fire suppression, for instance, with the emergence of more species pollinated by moths. Not only generalist lightcolored actinomorphic flowers, but also tubular or cup-like nectar flowers commonly associated with more specialized pollinators predominated in both periods. The dominance of these contrasting features actually increased after two decades, especially when we compare the number of individuals in each group. However, it seems that the increase in plant diversity and density of woody species did not lead to marked specialization of floral features and pollination system along the studied period.",2016

We report flower consumption of Echinopsis rhodotricha by Mazama americana and Pecari tajacu in the Brazilian Chaco. In order to evaluate the effects of florivory on the reproductive success of E. rhodotricha, we quantified and compared the fruit set between damaged and undamaged flowers in a natural population of this cactus. We recorded 21 damaged flowers in the year 2015 and 43 in 2016. Florivores consumed the whole flowers and therefore no fruits developed. The result of this study indicates that florivory decreases the fruit set in the studied population, both directly by damaging the reproductive organs and indirectly through the reduction of floral attractiveness and rewards for pollinators.",2016
Ceratopogonidae (Diptera: Nematocera) of the piedmont of the Yungas forests of Tucuman: ecology and distribution,Anthropic areas; Montane forests; Argentina,CULICOIDES BITING MIDGES; ARGENTINA; VECTORS,"Within the Ceratopogonidae family, many genera transmit numerous diseases to humans and animals, while others are important pollinators of tropical crops. In the Yungas ecoregion of Argentina, previous systematic and ecological research on Ceratopogonidae focused on Culicoides, since they are the main transmitters of mansonelliasis in northwestern Argentina; however, few studies included the genera Forcipomyia, Dasyhelea, Atrichopogon, Alluaudomyia, Echinohelea, and Bezzia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the presence and abundance of Ceratopogonidae in this region, their association with meteorological variables, and their variation in areas disturbed by human activity. Monthly collection of specimens was performed from July 2008 to July 2009 using CDC miniature light traps deployed for two consecutive days. A total of 360 specimens were collected, being the most abundant Dasyhelea genus (48.06%) followed by Forcipomyia (26.94%) and Atrichopogon (13.61%). Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in the abundance of the genera at different sampling sites and climatic conditions, with the summer season and El Corralito site showing the greatest abundance of specimens. Accumulated rainfall was the variable that related the most to the abundance of Culicoides (10.56%), while temperature was the most closely related variable to the abundance of Forcipomyia, Dasyhelea, and Atrichopogon.",2016
Latent class models for ecological inference on voters transitions,Voters' mobility; Ecological inference; Latent class models; Dirichlet-multinomial distribution,AGGREGATE DATA,"This paper introduces some new models of ecological inference within the context of estimation of voter transitions across elections. In particular, we assume that voters of a given party in a given occasion may be split into two latent types: faithful voters, who will certainly vote again for the same party and movers, who will reconsider their choice. Our models allow for unobserved heterogeneity across polling stations both in the weights of the two latent classes within each party and also when modelling the choice of unfaithful voters. Different ways of modelling the unobserved heterogeneity are considered by exploiting properties of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and the Brown Payne model of voting transitions can be seen as a special case within the class of models presented here. We discuss pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation and present an application to recent elections in Italy.",2016

While butterflies are responding to climate changes in many ways, they are not keeping pace. Rapid climate changes are leading to an accumulation of climate debts (or loss of climatic habitat) at continental scales. Climate change mediated shifts in distribution depend on many factors, but particularly on species-specific dispersal abilities and availability of larval host plants. We measured geographical variation in mobility for butterfly species across North America relative to their conservation status and the intensity of human land use. We identified areas where the rate and variability of recent climatic changes have been relatively low and could be managed for pollinator conservation, potentially augmenting existing protected area networks. Using the Yellowstone to Yukon region as a case study, we outline differences between connectivity analyses that incorporate (i) human footprint, (ii) human footprint in conjunction with climate change considerations, and (iii) human footprint in conjunction with climate change considerations weighted by species mobility and richness. All three approaches yield different connectivity recommendations. Conservation management efforts to enhance climate change-related dispersal should focus on improving landscape connectivity based on species-specific mobility, richness, and climate change, as well as landscape permeability. Improving connectivity is particularly vital in areas where mobility and landscape permeability are low but species are at greatest risk of extinction. Mobility matters when considering efforts to mitigate climate change impacts on butterflies.",2016

Mexican people have developed several technologies to extract products from Agave, and for many years they have consumed five different alcoholic beverages derived from Agave: Tequila, Mezcal, Bacanora, Raicilla, and Pulque. Additionally, Agave has coevolved with nectar-feeding bats, and in several cases, bats play the main role as functional pollinators in this ecological relationship. But with growth in the demand of agave derived products, management practices have reduced dependence on bat pollination, using instead clonal shoots to replant fields and harvesting plants before flowering, thereby negatively affecting both bats (by decreasing food availability) and agaves (by lowering their genetic diversity). We explore the possibility that bat-friendly practices may be incorporated into the production system. We compiled data about the pollination biology of Agave to infer how many bats could use the available resources, if Mezcal and Tequila producers allowed 5-10% of agave crop inflorescences to flower based on a linear projection using Agave angustifolia (a sister group of A. tequilana). If only 5% of the plants in one hectare were allowed to flower (approximately 222 individuals), then, depending on nectar concentration and total volume, a minimum of 89 individual bats could feed every night during flowering period. This means that allowing 5% of the current total population of A. tequilana reproductive agaves to flower could feed a total of 2,336,250 nectar feeding bats per month.",2016
Top-down network analysis characterizes hidden termite-termite interactions,Antagonism; community interactions; host-parasitoid; inquilines; mound; mutualism; network structure; plant; pollinator; termite,CORNITERMES-CUMULANS ISOPTERA; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; CENTRAL ILLINOIS; PLANT; NESTEDNESS; PATTERNS; ROBUSTNESS,"The analysis of ecological networks is generally bottom-up, where networks are established by observing interactions between individuals. Emergent network properties have been indicated to reflect the dominant mode of interactions in communities that might be mutualistic (e.g., pollination) or antagonistic (e.g., host-parasitoid communities). Many ecological communities, however, comprise species interactions that are difficult to observe directly. Here, we propose that a comparison of the emergent properties from detail-rich reference communities with known modes of interaction can inform our understanding of detail-sparse focal communities. With this top-down approach, we consider patterns of coexistence between termite species that live as guests in mounds built by other host termite species as a case in point. Termite societies are extremely sensitive to perturbations, which precludes determining the nature of their interactions through direct observations. We perform a literature review to construct two networks representing termite mound cohabitation in a Brazilian savanna and in the tropical forest of Cameroon. We contrast the properties of these cohabitation networks with a total of 197 geographically diverse mutualistic plant-pollinator and antagonistic host-parasitoid networks. We analyze network properties for the networks, perform a principal components analysis (PCA), and compute the Mahalanobis distance of the termite networks to the cloud of mutualistic and antagonistic networks to assess the extent to which the termite networks overlap with the properties of the reference networks. Both termite networks overlap more closely with the mutualistic plant-pollinator communities than the antagonistic host-parasitoid communities, although the Brazilian community overlap with mutualistic communities is stronger. The analysis raises the hypothesis that termite-termite cohabitation networks may be overall mutualistic. More broadly, this work provides support for the argument that cryptic communities may be analyzed via comparison to well-characterized communities.",2016

These studies have rarely been conducted in urban landscapes, and even fewer have compared species diversity and abundances over time. We surveyed native stingless bee nests at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora campus in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, from May 2008 to April 2009. We recorded the number of nests, nest height, species diversity, and nest substrate type (i.e., natural or artificial). We compared our results to those of a similar survey carried out in the same location eight years prior (2000/2001) in order to evaluate how urban expansion on campus has influenced the Meliponini bee community. Stingless bee abundance and richness were greater in the second survey. The use of natural substrates decreased, while the use of artificial substrates increased. This suggests that the increase in man-made structures on the UFJF campus has provided favorable sites for establishment of some stingless bee species.",2016

This relationship has led to the evolution of nocturnal activity patterns, which are influenced by environmental conditions. In the present study, abiotic factors were investigated to comprehend the influence on the flight patterns and identify the sex ratio of beetles from this subfamily. A study was conducted at Campo de Instrucao Marechal Newton Cavalcanti in northeastern Brazil between December 2010 and November 2011. Thirteen species of Dynastinae were identified, most of which were from the genus Cyclocephala. Abundance and richness were greater in the dry season. Six species exhibited peak flight activity at specific periods of the night. More females than males were recorded for Cyclocephala distincta and C. paraguayensis. The present findings suggest that rainfall reduces the flight activity of these beetles and different time schedules may be related to mating behavior, foraging behavior and the avoidance of interspecific resource competition.

Native to South America, the pathogen has recently entered Australia which has a rich Myrtaceous flora, including trees of the ecologically and economically important genus Eucalyptus. We studied the genetic basis of variation in rust resistance in Eucalyptus globulus, the main plantation eucalypt in Australia. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was undertaken using 218 genotypes of an outcross F-2 mapping family, phenotyped by controlled inoculation of their open pollinated progeny with the strain of P. psidii found in Australia. QTL analyses were conducted using a binary classification of individuals with no symptoms (immune) versus those with disease symptoms, and in a separate analysis dividing plants with disease symptoms into those exhibiting the hypersensitive response versus those with more severe symptoms. Four QTL were identified, two influencing whether a plant exhibited symptoms (Ppr2 and Ppr3), and two influencing the presence or absence of a hypersensitive reaction (Ppr4 and Ppr5). These QTL mapped to four different linkage groups, none of which overlap with Ppr1, the major QTL previously identified for rust resistance in Eucalyptus grandis. Candidate genes within the QTL regions are presented and possible mechanisms discussed. Together with past findings, our results suggest that P. psidii resistance in eucalypts is quantitative in nature and influenced by the complex interaction of multiple loci of variable effect.",2016
Habitat type plays a greater role than livestock grazing in structuring shrubsteppe plant-pollinator communities,Biodiversity; Community composition; Insect conservation; Livestock grazing; Pollinators; Shrubsteppe,WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; FLOWERING PLANTS; BOMBUS SPP.; GRASSLAND; DIVERSITY; BEES; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE; INTENSITY,"Livestock grazing is a widespread grassland disturbance and can negatively impact biodiversity. Pollinators constitute a vital component of grassland ecosystems, but the impact of grazing on pollinator diversity has seldom been evaluated in North America. We assessed vegetation structure, and pollinator and flowering plant abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition in four pairs of spring-grazed/ungrazed sites in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We also investigated whether pollinator or floral communities differed between the two threatened shrubsteppe habitat types we sampled-antelope-brush and big sagebrush shrubsteppe. Pan-trapping surveys captured 5907 bees, flies, beetles, wasps and butterflies constituting 253 species. We found that the percent cover of shrubs and bare soil increased with grazing, while the height of grasses and forbs decreased. In contrast, pollinator and flowering plant abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition were not significantly affected by grazing. Flowering plant and pollinator community composition did differ significantly between shrubsteppe habitats. Our results indicate that grasslands in North America, when managed responsibly, can maintain pollinator and flowering plant diversity under grazing pressure. The continued effort of land managers to balance ecological integrity and economic viability will be important for the conservation of grassland pollination systems.",2016

Introduction to the Special Issue: Advances in island plant biology since Sherwin Carlquist's Island Biology,Biogeography; island ecology and conservation; oceanic islands; palaeoecology; phylogeography,CONSERVATION; LONG,"Sherwin Carlquist's seminal publications-in particular his classic Island Biology, published in 1974-formulated hypotheses specific to island biology that remain valuable today. This special issue brings together some of the most interesting contributions presented at the First Island Biology Symposiumhosted in Honolulu on 7-11 July 2014. We compiled a total of 18 contributions that present data from multiple archipelagos across the world and from different disciplines within the plant sciences. In this introductory paper, we first provide a short overview of Carlquist's life and work and then summarize the main findings of the collated papers. A first group of papers deals with issues to which Carlquist notably contributed: long-distance dispersal, adaptive radiation and plant reproductive biology. The findings of such studies demonstrate the extent to which the field has advanced thanks to (i) the increasing availability and richness of island data, covering many taxonomic groups and islands; (ii) new information from the geosciences, phylogenetics and palaeoecology, which allows us a more realistic understanding of the geological and biological development of islands and their biotas; and (iii) the new theoretical and methodological advances that allow us to assess patterns of abundance, diversity and distribution of island biota over large spatial scales. Most other papers in the issue cover a range of topics related to plant conservation on islands, such as causes and consequences of mutualistic disruptions (due to pollinator or disperser losses, introduction of alien predators, etc.). Island biologists are increasingly considering reintroducing ecologically important species to suitable habitats within their historic range and to neighbouring islands with depauperate communities of vertebrate seed dispersers, and an instructive example is given here. Finally, contributions on ecological networks demonstrate the usefulness of this methodological tool to advancing conservation management and better predicting the consequences of disturbances on species and interactions in the fragile insular ecosystems.",2016
Predicting ecosystem functions from biodiversity and mutualistic networks: an extension of trait-based concepts to plant-animal interactions,,SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; LAND-USE CHANGE; FOOD WEBS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; FRUGIVORE NETWORKS; QUANTITY COMPONENT; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; CROP POLLINATION; TROPICAL FOREST,"Research linking biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has been mostly centred on the influence of species richness on ecosystem functions in small-scale experiments with single trophic levels. In natural ecosystems, many ecosystem functions are mediated by interactions between plants and animals, such as pollination and seed dispersal by animals, for which BEF relationships are little understood. Largely disconnected from BEF research, network ecology has examined the structural diversity of complex ecological networks of interacting species. Here, we provide an overview of the most important concepts in BEF and ecological network research and exemplify their applicability to natural ecosystems with examples from pollination and seed-dispersal studies. In a synthesis, we connect the structural approaches of network analysis with the trait-based approaches of BEF research and propose a conceptual trait-based model for understanding BEF relationships of plant-animal interactions in natural ecosystems. The model describes the sequential processes that determine the BEF relationship, i.e. the responses of species to environmental filters, the matching of species in ecological networks and the functionality of species in terms of their quantitative and qualitative contributions to plant demography and ecosystem functioning. We illustrate this conceptual integration with examples from mutualistic interactions and highlight its value for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss for multispecies interactions and ecosystem functions. We foresee that a better integration between BEF and network research will improve our mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity relates to the functioning of natural ecosystems. Our conceptual model is a step towards this integration between structural and functional biodiversity research.",2015

Currently, expert knowledge and reference collections are essential to identify pollen origin through light microscopy. Pollen identification through molecular sequencing and DNA barcoding has been proposed as an alternative approach, but the assessment of mixed pollen samples originating from multiple plant species is still a tedious and error-prone task. Next-generation sequencing has been proposed to avoid this hindrance. In this study we assessed mixed pollen probes through next-generation sequencing of amplicons from the highly variable, species-specific internal transcribed spacer 2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Further, we developed a bioinformatic workflow to analyse these high-throughput data with a newly created reference database. To evaluate the feasibility, we compared results from classical identification based on light microscopy from the same samples with our sequencing results. We assessed in total 16 mixed pollen samples, 14 originated from honeybee colonies and two from solitary bee nests. The sequencing technique resulted in higher taxon richness (deeper assignments and more identified taxa) compared to light microscopy. Abundance estimations from sequencing data were significantly correlated with counted abundances through light microscopy. Simulation analyses of taxon specificity and sensitivity indicate that 96% of taxa present in the database are correctly identifiable at the genus level and 70% at the species level. Next-generation sequencing thus presents a useful and efficient workflow to identify pollen at the genus and species level without requiring specialised palynological expert knowledge.",2015
APPLICATION OF ITS2 METABARCODING TO DETERMINE THE PROVENANCE OF POLLEN COLLECTED BY HONEY BEES IN AN AGROECOSYSTEM,Apis mellifera; bee foraging landscape; Fraxinus; palynology; pollen analysis; pollinator ecology,APIS-MELLIFERA; DNA BARCODE; COLONIES; BACTERIA; STRESS,"Premise of the study: Melissopalynology, the identification of bee-collected pollen, provides insight into the flowers exploited by foraging bees. Information provided by melissopalynology could guide floral enrichment efforts aimed at supporting pollinators, but it has rarely been used because traditional methods of pollen identification are laborious and require expert knowledge. We approach melissopalynology in a novel way, employing a molecular method to study the pollen foraging of honey bees (Apis mellifera) in a landscape dominated by field crops, and compare these results to those obtained by microscopic melissopalynology. Methods: Pollen was collected from honey bee colonies in Madison County, Ohio, USA, during a two-week period in mid-spring and identified using microscopic methods and ITS2 metabarcoding. Results: Metabarcoding identified 19 plant families and exhibited sensitivity for identifying the taxa present in large and diverse pollen samples relative to microscopy, which identified eight families. The bulk of pollen collected by honey bees was from trees (Sapindaceae, Oleaceae, and Rosaceae), although dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and mustard (Brassicaceae) pollen were also abundant. Discussion: For quantitative analysis of pollen, using both metabarcoding and microscopic identification is superior to either individual method. For qualitative analysis, ITS2 metabarcoding is superior, providing heightened sensitivity and genus-level resolution.",2015

(Common ragweed) that are relevant to understanding its ecology. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history, conservation, impacts and management.Ambrosia artemisiifolia is a monoecious, wind-pollinated, annual herb native to North America whose height varies from 10cm to 2.5m, according to environmental conditions. It has erect, branched stems and pinnately lobed leaves. Spike-like racemes of male capitula composed of staminate (male) florets terminate the stems, while cyme-like clusters of pistillate (female) florets are arranged in groups in the axils of main and lateral stem leaves. Seeds require prolonged chilling to break dormancy. Following seedling emergence in spring, the rate of vegetative growth depends on temperature, but development occurs over a wide thermal range. In temperate European climates, male and female flowers are produced from summer to early autumn (July to October).Ambrosia artemisiifolia is sensitive to freezing. Late spring frosts kill seedlings and the first autumn frosts terminate the growing season. It has a preference for dry soils of intermediate to rich nutrient level.Ambrosia artemisiifolia was introduced into Europe with seed imports from North America in the 19th century. Since World War II, it has become widespread in temperate regions of Europe and is now abundant in open, disturbed habitats as a ruderal and agricultural weed. Recently, the North American ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) has been detected in southern Switzerland and northern Italy. This species appears to have the capacity to substantially reduce growth and seed production of A.artemisiifolia. In heavily infested regions of Europe, A.artemisiifolia causes substantial crop-yield losses and its copious, highly allergenic pollen creates considerable public health problems. There is a consensus among models that climate change will allow its northward and uphill spread in Europe.",2015
Ecological specialization matters: long-term trends in butterfly species richness and assemblage composition depend on multiple functional traits,Assemblage homogenization; butterflies; extinction; functional traits; global change; species richness decline,BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; EXTINCTION DEBT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; EUROPE; BIODIVERSITY; DECLINES; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS; RESPONSES,"Aim To quantify spatio-temporal changes in species richness and assemblage composition of Danish butterflies over more than 100 years and to assess whether different functional groups of butterflies show different temporal trajectories. Location Denmark, Europe. Methods We applied species accumulation curves to estimate relative species richness changes from unequally sampled occurrence records, collected over more than a century (1900-2012), at local (i.e. 10 km x 10 km) and regional (country-wide) spatial scales. Furthermore, we calculated similarity in species composition between 10 km x 10 km grid cells to evaluate changes in assemblage composition (i.e. biotic homogenization) of butterflies through space and time. Trends were evaluated for all butterflies as well as for three functional groups, using hierarchical clustering and species-specific values of eight ecological traits. Results We document severe declines in butterfly diversity over the last century, with substantial regional-scale extinctions leading to a net loss of 10% of all Danish butterfly species. Segregating species into functional groups showed that the highest rate of regional extinction occurred among sedentary habitat specialists overwintering in the egg stage, while the most severe local-scale declines occurred among sedentary host plant specialists overwintering in the larval stage. In contrast, mobile generalist species with mature overwintering stages showed stable richness trends throughout the century. However, a pervasive spatio-temporal biotic homogenization of butterfly assemblages was revealed for all functional groups. Main conclusions Our results suggest that observed changes in species richness were driven by a gradual replacement of ecological specialists by broadly adapted ecological generalists. In addition to drawing attention to a severe long-term impoverishment of the Danish butterfly fauna, our results suggest that trajectories of butterfly species richness and assemblage composition over the last century are related to multiple functional traits, highlighting the need to consider different aspects of ecological specialization when assessing extinction risk.",2015
The conservation value of urban green space habitats for Australian native bee communities,Bees; Pollinators; Urban ecology; Urban landscapes,CROP POLLINATION; WILD POLLINATORS; SPECIES RICHNESS; LANDSCAPE; PLANTS; HYMENOPTERA; GARDENS; ABUNDANCE; DECLINES; AREAS,"Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3) front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants. Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes.

Multispecies interactions across trophic levels at macroscales: retrospective and future directions,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; SPECIES-RICHNESS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; BIRD DIVERSITY,"Trophic interactions among multiple species are ubiquitous in nature and their importance for structuring ecological communities has been extensively demonstrated at local spatial scales. However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions. This could also help to develop more realistic forecasts of changes in biodiversity under climate and land use change.",2015
Macroecological trends in nestedness and modularity of seed-dispersal networks: human impact matters,Climate; conservation; ecological networks; frugivory; human impact; latitude; mutualism; species interactions,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; MODEL SELECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; ARCHITECTURE; EVOLUTION; ABUNDANCE,"AimWe aim to characterize the macroecological patterns in the structure of mutualistic seed-dispersal networks. Tropical areas hold more species than temperate ones. This difference in species number may favour ecological processes that minimize interspecific competition in species-rich areas. There is theoretical evidence that both modularity (i.e. the presence of semi-independent groups of highly interacting species) and nestedness (i.e. specialists interact with a subset of the species interacting with generalists) reduce the effects of competition. Thus, we expect high degrees of modularity or nestedness at low latitudes in seed-dispersal networks. Moreover, we test whether climate, topography and human impact influence network structure. LocationThirty-four qualitative and 21 weighted seed-dispersal interaction networks located world-wide. methods we related the degree of modularity and nestedness of seed-dispersal interaction networks with latitude. To disentangle the macroecological drivers of network structure, we also associated modularity/nestedness with species richness, altitudinal range, human impact and an array of climate predictors: precipitation, temperature, precipitation/temperature seasonality and historical climate-change velocity and anomaly. results binary networks showed stronger macroecological patterns than weighted networks. Latitude was unrelated to the structure of seed-dispersal networks, but more nested assemblages were species rich and were located in areas with a high degree of human impact, high temperature seasonality, low precipitation, and, especially on the mainland, high stability in precipitation. Modular networks were species rich and found in areas with low human impact. For both nestedness and modularity, the effects of species richness and human impact were especially strong and consistent. Main conclusions as for previous macroecological studies of mutualistic networks, we found that the structure of seed-dispersal assemblages was related to current and historical climate. The largest influences on nestedness and modularity, however, were the number of competing species and the degree of human impact. This suggests that human disturbance, not just climate, is an important factor determining the structure of a seed-dispersal network.",2015

We have therefore studied wild bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity structure in forest landscapes and evaluated the importance of conservation management at the local and landscape levels. Surveys were conducted at 32 clearcuts in eight landscapes in a managed boreal forest region. We assessed the influence of local habitat and landscape composition on species richness patterns and the effect of prescribed burning and landscape affinity on species composition for all bees and wasps as well as ecological and functional groups. The relative contribution of alpha and beta diversity on the regional level was assessed by diversity partitioning and the beta diversity between landscapes further partitioned into components of species turnover and nestedness. Bee and wasp species richness increased with high flower richness and clearcut size, and species composition differed between burned and unburned sites. Thus, flower-rich early-successional sites in boreal forest landscapes are important habitats for wild bees and wasps. To support this fauna, openness should be maintained for extended periods by delaying or avoiding tree plantation at flower-rich spots on clearcuts. Beta diversity between landscapes accounted for the greatest proportion of the total regional gamma diversity, and over 70% of this diversity was due to species turnover. This implies that in order to maintain regional diversity, conservation efforts should be spatially dispersed, i.e. applied to every landscape of a few hundred square kilometers and adapted to the local species assemblages.

Stakeholder involvement with participatory research and development programmes for farmers is an essential part of it. Currently, ecological engineering by habitat management and participatory programmes and mass media campaigns are developed to counteract the adverse effects of ongoing intensification of rice production in Southeast Asia. These schemes often suggest the establishment of flower strips. Flower strips are a common measure to promote biodiversity and ecosystem service conservation in industrialised countries, since they aesthetically enrich production landscapes and provide supplementary food resources and shelter for natural enemies and pollinators. We review management options for biological pest control, pollination and cultural services in rice production landscapes and evaluate the parallel development of participatory programmes and mass media campaigns for sustainable rice production. Biological pest control, pollination services and landscape aesthetics could benefit from the establishment of flower strips in rice production landscapes. However, more experimental studies are needed to test the benefits of different plant species, potential interactions between local and landscape scale and interactions between different ecosystem services. Rice farmers should better appreciate their benefits from regulating ecosystem services and should be involved in the development and implementation of ecological engineering. Mass media campaigns and participatory programmes can motivate farmers, but their efficiency needs to be tested in different regions. Combining participatory approaches and mass media campaigns with the establishment of flower strips and other beneficial habitats has potential to increase the sustainability of rice production in Asia.",2015

However, recent concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee assemblages at a regional scale (450 km(2)) in mass-flowering crops and semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i.e. 20 % of the whole bee fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3-4 times lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with a substantial number of these being social and gregarious species. Spatial and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28.6 and 34.3 %, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we suggest wild bee conservation efforts should be carried out at relevant spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within 50 km(2) scales. This provides an order of magnitude for the spatial extent of relevant conservation units within which one may concentrate conservation efforts in order to optimise the number of species promoted per surface area.",2015

The impact of three management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming) alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees, butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale (ca. 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass, wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover). Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries. Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean abundance of uncropped land was 3.6% and at least double this was required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover. Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover. Wildlife habitat in agricultural landscapes may be insufficient and additional, diverse habitats are needed to encourage pollinators. ",2015

Understanding the mechanisms for mating-defence interactions promises to broaden our understanding of how ecological processes can generate these two rich sources of angiosperm diversity. Here, I review current research on the role of herbivory as a driver of mating system evolution, and the role of mating systems in the evolution of defence strategies. I outline different ecological mechanisms and processes that could generate these coevolutionary patterns, and summarize theoretical and empirical support for each. I provide a conceptual framework for linking plant defence with mating system theory to better integrate these two research fields.",2015

In California (USA), high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have facilitated the invasion of exotic grasses, posing a threat to the diverse plant and insect communities endemic to serpentine grasslands. Cattle grazing has been employed to mitigate the consequences of exotic grass invasion, but the ecological effects of grazing in this system are not fully understood. To characterize the effects of realistic N deposition on serpentine plant communities and to evaluate the efficacy of grazing as a management tool, we performed a factorial experiment adding N and excluding large herbivores in California's largest serpentine grassland. Although we observed significant interannual variation in community composition related to climate in our six-year study, exotic cover was consistently and negatively correlated with native plant richness. Sustained low-level N addition did not influence plant community composition, but grazing reduced grass abundance while maintaining greater native forb cover, native plant diversity, and species richness in comparison to plots excluding large herbivores. Furthermore, grazing increased the temporal stability of plant communities by decreasing year-to-year variation in native forb cover, native plant diversity, and native species richness. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that moderate-intensity cattle grazing can be used to restrict the invasive potential of exotic grasses and maintain native plant communities in serpentine grasslands. We hypothesize that the reduced temporal variability in serpentine plant communities managed by grazing may directly benefit populations of the threatened Edith's Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis).",2015
Prairie restorations and bees: The potential ability of seed mixes to foster native bee communities,Pollinator; Bee richness; Bee conservation; Prairie; Iowa; Native plants; Grasslands,ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; POLLINATOR; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; DIVERSITY; HISTORY; TRAITS,"Restoring native habitat is considered critical to conserving native pollinators threatened by habitat loss and degradation, but little is known about whether ecological restorations, most of which do not target pollinators, can predictably support pollinator communities. In this study we compare plant species richness in common commercial prairie seed mixes to remnant prairies, and we take a modeling approach to examine the ability of these seed mixes to attract bee communities relative to native prairie remnants. Using a large data set from native prairies in Iowa consisting of 70 bee species (approximate to 2700 bee specimens) associated with 54 native prairie plants, we constructed species accumulation curves to model the number of bee species potentially attracted to a restoration with the addition of each plant in a seed mix. Our modeling results indicate commercial prairie mixes will accumulate species at rates similar to prairie remnants, but the bee species richness will be lower than remnants because the plant species richness in samples from prairie remnants is twice that of the average commercial seed mix. However, when commercially available seed mixes were modeled to always include four plant species that were exceptionally attractive to native bee species, most mixes attracted significantly more bees than predicted if random species were added. This further suggests that seed mixes and the resulting restorations do not adequately provide for pollinators and could be significantly improved with the addition of a small number of species. Although the particular optimal species additions to seed mixes will vary regionally, adding species functionally equivalent to those we identify may significantly improve restoration of ecological services provided by native bees.",2015

We investigated whether CAM evolution can be associated with the availability of new or alternative niches, using Eulophiinae orchids as a case study. Carbon isotope ratios, geographical and climate data, fossil records and DNA sequences were used to: assess the prevalence of CAM in Eulophiinae orchids; characterize the ecological niche of extant taxa; infer divergence times; and estimate whether CAM is associated with niche shifts. CAM evolved in four terrestrial lineages during the late Miocene/Pliocene, which have uneven diversification patterns. These lineages originated in humid habitats and colonized dry/seasonally dry environments in Africa and Madagascar. Additional key features (variegation, heterophylly) evolved in the most species-rich CAM lineages. Dry habitats were also colonized by a lineage that includes putative mycoheterotrophic taxa. These findings indicate that the switch to CAM is associated with environmental change. With its suite of adaptive traits, this group of orchids represents a unique opportunity to study the adaptations to dry environments, especially in the face of projected global aridification.",2015

In plants, bacteria have numerous functions, with variable net effects, both in natural and agricultural systems. However, information about the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities associated with different aboveground plant organs, particularly flowers, is lacking. In addition, the relative effects of microhabitat and environmental conditions on community establishment require further attention. Here, using culture-independent methods, we determine that leaves and three floral microhabitats (nectar, stamina and styles) of Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae), a tree endemic to Hawai'i, host unique indicator communities composed of relatively abundant bacterial taxa. These indicator communities are accompanied by a large number of ubiquitous or rare bacteria with lower abundances. In our study system, the strong effect of microhabitat filtering on plant-associated community composition and bacterial richness and diversity strongly exceeds the influence of environmental effects such as precipitation, altitude, substrate age and geographic distance. Thus, the bacterial richness of aboveground plant organs is strongly underestimated when only one microhabitat, e.g. leaves, is considered. Our study represents a first step towards a comprehensive characterization of the distribution, composition and underlying factors, of plant bacterial communities, with implications for future basic and applied research on plant health, pollination and reproduction.",2015

However, little is known about how trophic interactions between species and, in particular, the food webs that these interactions comprise, change with elevation. Here we present results for the first comparison of quantitative food webs in forest understorey and canopy along an elevational gradient. Replicate quantitative food webs were constructed for assemblages involving 23 species of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera and 12 species of their parasitoids and kleptoparasites in subtropical rainforest in Australia. A total of 1589 insects were collected using trap nests across 20 plots distributed at sites ranging from 300 to 1100 m a.s.l. Insect abundance, insect diversity and parasitism rate generally decreased with increasing elevation. Food web structure significantly changed with elevation. In particular, weighted quantitative measures of linkage density, interaction evenness, nestedness (weighted NODF) and potential for enemy mediated interactions (PAC) decreased with increasing elevation, and network specialisation (H-2) increased with increasing elevation, even after controlling for matrix size; but there was no change in weighted connectance. Changes in forest type and temperature along the elevational gradient are likely to be, at least partly, responsible for the patterns observed. We found no significant differences in insect abundance, insect diversity or parasitism rate between canopy and understorey. Furthermore, there were no differences in food web structure between strata. These results contribute further evidence to studies revealing changes in food web structure along natural environmental gradients and provide information that can potentially be used for predicting how communities may respond to climate change.",2015

Their small body size, bright colors, and unique behaviour have fascinated generations of naturalists. In this review, we investigate the morphological and behavioural adaptations of hummingbirds to feed on nectar and arthropods, and explore their diffuse co-evolution with their food plant species. Further, a list of plant genera including species mainly pollinated by hummingbirds is presented. Summarising the existing knowledge on hummingbird feeding ecology, we find that much of the variability in morphology and behaviour of hummingbirds is determined by their unique feeding mode and the constraints set by their food plants. Based on the existing literature, we developed a hierarchical system explaining how different environmental factors have shaped the current richness of hummingbirds, and their morphological and behavioural diversity. We propose that climatic stability within and between seasons and days determines the constancy of food availability, which in turn is the most important factor for species richness in hummingbird assemblages. However, the assemblage composition of hummingbirds is also influenced by phylogenetic factors, especially under harsh environmental conditions. Unsurprisingly, the highest morphological and behavioural diversity is observed in the most species-rich assemblages. This diversity may have at least partly evolved to reduce inter-and intraspecific competition. Independently of which morphological character we consider, the 360 different hummingbird species have evolved a large morphological variability to adapt to their individual feeding niches.",2015
Does multi-level environmental filtering determine the functional and phylogenetic composition of wild bee species assemblages?,,COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; FORAGING RANGES; SOLITARY BEES; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; SCALE; DIVERSIFICATION,"A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that explain the diversity and distribution of species. The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.",2015

They also provide valuable services to agriculture, such as pollination, pest control and maintenance of soil quality. We investigated the responses of wild bees, spiders, earthworms and plants to geographic location, agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables using a dataset of 357 grassland fields within 88 farms in six European regions. Regions and taxonomic groups were selected to have contrasting properties, in order to capture the multiple facets of European grasslands. Geographic location alone had a dominant effect on the fauna and flora communities. Depending on the taxonomic group, various agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables alone had an additional significant effect on observed species richness, rarefied species richness and/or abundance, but it was always small. Bee species richness and abundance decreased with increasing number of mechanical operations (e.g. cutting). Observed spider species richness and abundance were unrelated to measured aspects of agricultural management or to surrounding landscape variables, whereas rarefied species richness showed significant relations to nitrogen input, habitat diversity and amount of grassland habitats in the surroundings. Earthworm abundance increased with increasing nitrogen input but earthworm species richness did not. Observed plant species richness decreased with increasing nitrogen input and increased when there were woody habitats in the surroundings. Rarefied plant species richness decreased with mechanical operations. Investigating multiple regions, taxonomic groups and aspects of fauna and flora communities allowed identifying the main factors structuring communities, which is necessary for designing appropriate conservation measures and ensuring continued supply of services.",2015

By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity. Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5 m wide) than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. <= 3.5 m wide) and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of flowers. Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5 m wide, have the potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation.    ",2015

It has been suggested that certain morphological, ecological and life-history traits make some species more vulnerable to landscape changes. Information on which traits make species vulnerable and why may aid conservation of declining species. We performed a comprehensive analysis of how multiple traits related to diet breadth, movement and nesting habits moderate vulnerability of bumble bees to landscape simplification. We surveyed bumble bees in flower-rich non-crop habitats in either complex landscapes (with small crop fields bordered by non-crop habitats), or simple landscapes (with larger fields and therefore less non-crop habitats). We analysed if landscape type interacted with colony size, queen emergence date, colony life-cycle length, nesting habitat, thorax width, proboscis length or variability in thorax and proboscis, to explain bumble bee abundances. Workers and males of species with above-ground nests, small sized colonies and long colony cycle were relatively less abundant in simple compared to in complex landscapes. Simple landscapes hosted fewer males of late emerging species and species with highly variable proboscis length. This suggests that both nesting habitat and spatio-temporal availability of food resources act as ecological filters for bumble bees. Colony size correlated with nesting habitat and queen emergence when correcting for phylogenetic correlations, suggesting that landscape simplification acts through effects on combinations of traits. Our results have consequences for conservation by suggesting that declining bumble bee species can be supported by providing adequate nesting habitats and preferred plant species throughout the season and within short distance from nesting habitats, to allow utilisation also by species having colonies with few workers.",2015

By their involvement in specialized pollinator interactions, spurs have ecological and evolutionary significance, often leading to speciation. Despite their importance and diversity in shape and size among angiosperm taxa, detailed investigations of the mechanism of spur development have been conducted only recently. Methods Initiation and growth of the nectar-yielding petal spur of Centranthus ruber 'Snowcloud' was investigated throughout seven stages, based on bud size and developmental events. The determination of the frequency of cell division, quantified for the first time in spurs, was conducted by confocal microscopy following 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of mitotic figures. Moreover, using scanning electron microscospy of the outer petal spur surface unobstructed by trichomes, morphometry of epidermal cells was determined throughout development in order to understand the ontogeny of this elongate, hollow tube. Key Results Spur growth from the corolla base initially included diffuse cell divisions identified among epidermal cells as the spur progressed through its early stages. However, cell divisions clearly diminished before a petal spur attained 30 % of its final length of 4.5 mm. Thereafter until anthesis, elongation of individual cells was primarily responsible for the spur's own extension. Consequently, a prolonged period of anisotropy, wherein epidermal cells elongated almost uniformly in all regions along the petal spur's longitudinal axis, contributed principally to the spur's mature length. Conclusions This research demonstrates that anisotropic growth of epidermal cells - in the same orientation as spur elongation - chiefly explains petal spur extension in C. ruber. Representing the inaugural investigation of the cellular basis for spur ontogeny within the Euasterids II clade, this study complements the patterns in Aquilegia species (order Ranunculales, Eudicots) and Linaria vulgaris (order Lamiales, Euasterids I), thereby suggesting the existence of a common underlying mechanism for petal spur ontogeny in disparate dicot lineages.",2015

Understanding how increasing habitat loss affects ecological processes is critical for mitigating the effects of environmental changes on biodiversity and thus on the supply of ecosystem services by natural habitats. Habitat loss negatively affects pollinator diversity and the pollination service provided by insects, a key ecosystem service supporting the quantity, quality and diversity of crops directly consumed by humans and the sexual reproduction of most flowering plants. By integrating evolutionary relationships among traits that may modulate plant response to habitat loss, the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks and metacommunity models, we examine how plant-pollinator metacommunities might respond to habitat loss. The main predictions of our trait-based metacommunity model are that (1) variation on dispersal ability among plant species may prevent full metacommunity collapse under pollinator loss associated with increasing habitat loss; (2) habitat loss may select for plants with higher dispersal ability and higher autogamous self-pollination, and will typically decrease the incidence of pollination generalist plants; (3) metacommunities that comprise plants with high autonomous self-pollination ability may harbour higher richness of rare plant species when pollinator diversity declines with increased habitat loss. We discuss the implications of our results for the vulnerability of pollination services for biotically pollinated wild plants and crops co-occurring in human-dominated landscapes.",2015

Ecological restoration aims to rebuild this biome and should include not only the reinstatement of species but also the reestablishment of complex ecological interactions and the ecological functions that they provide. One such function is seed dispersal, which is provided by the interactions between animal frugivores and plants. We studied seed dispersal networks in 3 different tropical forest sites restored 15, 25, and 57 years ago; temporal scales rarely observed in restoration studies. We investigated changes in network structure (nestedness, modularity, and network specialization) in these communities over restoration time. Although network size and the number of interactions increased with time since restoration, the networks were composed of generalist birds, and the large frugivores remained absent. Contrary to our expectations though, species richness was highest in the 25-year-old site, maybe due to the higher number of species used in the planting. Nestedness values were low in all 3 networks, but the highest nestedness was observed in the intermediate-aged site. However, the oldest network was significantly modular and showed higher complementary specialization. These results suggest that 57 years after restoration, the complexity of mutualistic interactions in seed dispersal networks has increased, this enhancing ecosystem function in the Atlantic forest.",2015
The European Paleoendemic Haberlea rhodopensis (Gesneriaceae) Has an Oligocene Origin and a Pleistocene Diversification and Occurs in a Long-Persisting Refugial Area in Southeastern Europe,glacial refugia; Haberlea rhodopensis; molecular dating; paleoendemic; phylogeography; Tertiary relict,GENETIC-STRUCTURE; BALKAN PENINSULA; GLACIAL REFUGIA; TERTIARY RELICT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIDYMOCARPOID GESNERIACEAE; PHYLOGENETIC POSITION; RETICULATE EVOLUTION; CHLOROPLAST GENOMES; POLLINATION ECOLOGY,"Premise of research.Even though the Balkan Peninsula is a biodiversity hot spot in southeastern Europe harboring many endemic plants, very little is known about the temporal extent of the phylogeographic history and the contemporary genetic diversity of the endemics there. Haberlea rhodopensis is one of the European Gesneriaceae species occurring in this region and represents appropriate study material to address these questions.Methodology.We generated fossil-dated molecular phylogenies (atpB-rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnLF, ITS) across the Lamiales to determine the origin and age of H. rhodopensis and conducted phylogeographic (trnH-psbA, ITS) and population genetic (ISSRs) analyses on 17 populations from Bulgaria and Greece, covering the entire distribution range of the species, to investigate their biogeographic history, present-day genetic diversity, and differentiation levels.Pivotal results.The European Gesneriaceae genera have a Tertiary origin in the early Oligocene, while the Haberlea lineage emerged in the late Oligocene. Extinctions appear to have marked the history of the genus for a long period of time, and the extant populations diverged in the late Pleistocene. A significant differentiation was apparent between populations from Bulgaria, that is, the Balkan Mountains in the north and the Bulgarian side of the Rhodopi massif in the south, but there was an even stronger differentiation between the latter and populations from Greece. This might be explained by the Rhodopi massif representing a barrier to gene flow, enforced during the Last Glacial Maximum, during which populations descended on opposing north- and south-facing mountain slopes.Conclusions.Haberlea represents an ancient lineage with recent diversification. The extant populations are of recent origin and indicate glacial refugial areas in Bulgaria and Greece. This study sheds light on historic and current phylogenetic and phylogeographic events that shaped the flora of the Balkan Peninsula, an area that has long been recognized for its species diversity and richness. Our data suggest that it may have acted as a persistent refugial area in southeast Europe since the mid-Tertiary.",2015

Euglossine (or orchid) bees are a diverse lineage of insect pollinators distributed throughout the American tropics, where they provide pollination services to a staggering diversity of flowering plant taxa. Elucidating the seasonal patterns of phylogenetic assembly and functional trait diversity of bee communities can shed new light into the mechanisms that govern the assembly of bee pollinator communities and the potential effects of declining bee populations. Male euglossine bees collect, store, and accumulate odoriferous compounds (perfumes) to subsequently use during courtship display. Thus, synthetic chemical baits can be used to attract and monitor euglossine bee populations. We conducted monthly censuses of orchid bees in three sites in the Magdalena valley of Colombia - a region where Central and South American biotas converge - to investigate the structure, diversity, and assembly of euglossine bee communities through time in relation to seasonal climatic cycles. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that phylogenetic community structure and functional trait diversity changed in response to seasonal rainfall fluctuations. All communities exhibited strong to moderate phylogenetic clustering throughout the year, with few pronounced bursts of phylogenetic overdispersion that coincided with the transition from wet-to-dry seasons. Despite the heterogeneous distribution of functional traits (e.g., body size, body mass, and proboscis length) and the observed seasonal fluctuations in phylogenetic diversity, we found that functional trait diversity, evenness, and divergence remained constant during all seasons in all communities. However, similar to the pattern observed with phylogenetic diversity, functional trait richness fluctuated markedly with rainfall in all sites. These results emphasize the importance of considering seasonal fluctuations in community assembly and provide a glimpse to the potential effects that climatic alterations may have on both pollinator communities and the ecosystem services they provide.",2015
Natural habitat does not mediate vertebrate seed predation as an ecosystem dis-service to agriculture,almonds; birds; chaparral; ecosystem services; Israel; landscape ecology; rodents; sunflowers,PEST-CONTROL; WILD BEES; LANDSCAPES; DAMAGE; BIODIVERSITY; SUNFLOWER; BIRDS; INTENSIFICATION; AGROECOSYSTEMS; CONSERVATION,"1. Spillover of beneficial organisms from natural habitats to croplands can improve agro-ecosystem services, but wildlife can also negatively influence agricultural production. When managing agricultural landscapes to conserve biodiversity, we need to understand whether the availability of natural habitats increases ecosystem dis-services such as vertebrate seed predation to avoid risking higher costs than benefits. 2. We studied whether vertebrates and their impact in crop seed predation are related to the percentage of natural (chaparral) and semi-natural habitat (planted forest with native and exotic trees) in an agricultural landscape of Israel. We selected 20 almond and 20 sunflower study sites within a landscape with varying percentages of natural (0-61%) and semi-natural (0-70%) habitats within a 1000 m radius of their surroundings. We observed birds, trapped rodents (in almond), counted seeds and noted feeding marks to obtain seed predation rates, at each site. Within the almond crops, we physically excluded birds, rodents and both to determine their relative and combined influence on seed predation. 3. Neither vertebrate abundance nor species richness was influenced by the percentage of natural habitat. However, bird species richness increased with increasing percentage of semi-natural habitat. 4. Seed predation across both crops was not influenced by natural or semi-natural habitat but increased significantly with increasing abundance and species richness of birds. This was also reflected by the exclusions of birds, vertebrates and both to the almond crop, leading to lowest seed predation when both groups were excluded. 5. Synthesis and applications. Natural or semi-natural habitat did not influence the agro-ecosystem dis-service of seed predation by birds and rodents. Policymakers should consider promoting agri-environment schemes that include the conservation of natural habitats and the management of semi-natural habitats adjacent to cropland to enhance agro-ecosystem services meditated by beneficial organisms such as natural pest enemies and pollinators without fearing increased vertebrate seed predation. In order to provide more detailed management recommendations tackling the reduction of vertebrate dis-services, their feeding behaviour, metabolic needs, behaviour patterns and local abundances should be taken into account.",2015

We hypothesized that flowers pollinated by insects would emit significantly higher amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and would present a higher diversity of these compounds than flowers pollinated by wind. The floral emissions of fifteen entomophilous species and eleven anemophilous species were captured by dynamic headspace sampling under field conditions and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. We searched for differences in the emission profiles between anemophilous and entomophilous flowers by considering the effects of phylogeny in our analysis. The floral emissions from the two groups were significantly different. Entomophilous species presented highly diverse emissions in both magnitude of emission rates and richness of compounds depending on the species, but overall, the flowers from entomophilous species had much higher VOC emission rates and VOC richness, both for terpenes and benzenoid compounds, than those from anemophilous species (two orders of magnitude higher emissions). The data thus confirm that the presence of intensely scented flowers with complex scents is strongly related to biotic pollination.     ",2015
Long-term ecology of orchid bees in an urban forest remnant,atlantic forest; community structure; conservation; euglossine bee; Euglossini; population dynamics; stability index,FAUNAS HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; EUGLOSSINE BEES; EASTERN BRAZIL; SOUTHERN BAHIA; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL; RAIN-FOREST; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,"Ecological studies lasting more than 1 or 2 years are not particularly common anywhere and in any taxonomic group. Ecological studies in orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are not an exception and have focused on short-term scale. Long-term studies have been mostly neglected up to date. Orchid-bee males were attracted to five different scent baits in the same site every other year during a seven-year span, from 1997 to 2004, in an urban forest remnant, totaling four full years of samplings in between. In total, we captured 2188 bees from 14 species. Species diversity, evenness, and richness remained remarkably stable among years. The stability index, sensu Wolda, for the composite community revealed to be one of the highest ever recorded for insect communities. Our results suggest that orchid-bee populations may remain remarkably stable over the years even in a small (a parts per thousand 200 ha) area immersed in a metropolitan (a parts per thousand 3,000,000 inhabitants) matrix and that these urban areas should not be neglected in conservation efforts, since they seem to maintain viable populations of these important pollinators over time.",2015
"Elevation as a barrier: genetic structure for an Atlantic rain forest tree (Bathysa australis) in the Serra do Mar mountain range, SE Brazil",Altitude; gene flow; genetic diversity; microsatellites; Rubiaceae,RECENT POPULATION BOTTLENECKS; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS; PLANT-POPULATIONS; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; POA-HIEMATA; STATE-PARK,"Distance and discrete geographic barriers play a role in isolating populations, as seed and pollen dispersal become limited. Nearby populations without any geographic barrier between them may also suffer from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa australis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic diversity in six B.australis populations at two extreme sites along an elevation gradient: a lowland site (80-216m) and an upland site (1010-1100m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6km (F-ST=0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each corresponding to a site. Although B.australis is continuously distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to B.australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until similar to 10-20m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though, but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find any evidence for bottleneck.",2015
Reliability and refinement of the higher taxa approach for bee richness and composition assessments,Apoidea; bee communities; biodiversity assessment; biodiversity survey; conservation; species composition; taxonomic sufficiency,SPECIES RICHNESS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; WILD BEES; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; SURROGATES; SIZE; BIOINDICATORS,"Limited resources and taxonomic expertise in biodiversity surveys often lead to the application of the higher taxa approach (HTA), i.e., the identification of specimens to genus or higher taxonomic levels rather than to species. The reliability of the HTA varies significantly among studies, yet the factors underlying this variability have rarely been investigated. Bees are an ideal model taxon for testing the HTA because they are highly diverse, challenging to identify, and there is widespread interest in their role as native pollinators, driving demand for efficient diversity assessment tools. Using extensive bee data sets collected across three biomes and various habitats, we assessed the performance of the HTA in reflecting bee species richness and composition patterns at local scales, factors affecting this performance, and ways to improve it. The performance of the HTA varied considerably among biomes, taxonomic levels (genera and subfamilies), and diversity measures (species richness and composition); genus and subfamily richness accounted for 55-77% and 32-61% of the variation in species richness, respectively; genus and subfamily composition accounted for 28-87% and 26-80% of the variation in species composition, respectively. The number of species per higher taxon was a main factor influencing this performance (accounting for 63% of the variation), while the co-occurrence of taxonomically related species had no significant influence on the performance of the HTA. Further subdividing genera by body size contributed to the performance of the HTA and increased its accuracy in representation of compositional patterns by; 16%. Our results have several practical implications. The considerable variability found in the performance of the HTA in representing local-scale richness and composition patterns of bee species dictates caution in implementing this tool in bee surveys. When possible, an a priori evaluation of the expected performance of the HTA should be done, focusing on species distributions within higher taxonomic levels and the species : higher taxa ratio. Integrating morphological characteristics (such as body size) that consistently subdivide genera will improve the HTA's performance. Our results are likely applicable to the implementation of the HTA in other small-bodied and species-rich groups and may contribute to the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity surveys.",2015

DELILE; PLANT-HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS; EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; CLONAL PLANT; GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY; RESOURCE DEPLETION; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; MATING SYSTEM,"Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in flowering occur in many plant species with abiotic pollination and may confer fitness advantages through mechanisms such as predator satiation or pollination efficiency. Environmental factors such as light quality or quantity and temperature play an important role in inducing synchronization on wide geographic scales. On a smaller geographic scale, external factors such as resource availability and herbivory are theorized to trigger flowering, while genetic factors may also play an important role. In this study, we assessed the importance of ecological and genetic factors in shaping seascape-level spatial heterogeneity in flowering of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. By investigating spatially close sites (<20km) with similar seascape configurations and depth, we assume that major environmental drivers (temperature and light) were equivalent. We assessed four ecological factors (productivity, leaf nitrogen and carbon content and herbivory) and three genetic factors (heterozygosity, relatedness and clonality) to assess three hypotheses for synchronized flowering in P.oceanica: (i) clone synchronization (internal clock hypothesis), (ii) variation in nutrient availability, potentially caused by spatial heterogeneity in herbivory rates or nutrient translocation via clonal integration (resource budget hypothesis) or (iii) kin selection and sibling synchronization. Internal relatedness and heterozygosity had a significant positive effect on the abundance of flowers. Moreover, productivity and genotypic richness (clonality) were negatively associated with flower density, although at a lower level of significance. In addition, we found that clones were almost exclusively shared among mass-flowering patches and patches without mass-flowering, respectively.Synthesis. The results shed new light on seagrass flowering patterns and on the mechanisms of flower synchronization at the patch level within a wider spatial scale. We found support for the kin selection hypothesis and indirect evidence for the resource budget hypothesis. Thus, a combination of mainly genetic but also ecological factors causes the observed heterogeneous flowering patterns in Posidonia oceanica seascapes. In addition, we found a strong positive relationship between the number of flowers and heterozygosity, adding evidence to the controversial association between heterozygosity and fitness when a limited number of loci are used. To our knowledge, this study is the first to link both ecological and genetic factors with flower abundance in a species with a presumed masting strategy.",2015

However, the role of such interactions is still underestimated or neglected in ecology and paleoecology. Here, we consider pollen attacked by fungi in palynological records from Holocene raised peat bogs as a nutrient source for ecosystems in the past. The attacks occurred through the pollen germination areas by a variety of saprotrophic, ericoid mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal or dark septate endophyte fungi. Large amounts of attacked pollen in phases rich in Calluna vulgaris highlight the importance of Ericaceae shrubs, hosting ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and forming hotspots of decomposition in nutrient-deficit bogs. Applying estimations of pollen rain from literature, and based on own observed pollen infection rates we estimate the annual release of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium from pollen, and highlight their significance in pushing the ecosystem nutrient cycle in early spring time, when several species release their pollen. We highlight the significant role of anthropogenic changes in pollen deposition for pre-industrial bogs and hypothesize about the consequences of the pollen-based interrelation between wind-pollinated plants and their mycorrhizal fungi in paleoecology and evolution.

We conducted a similar analysis of palynological dispersed sporomorph (spore and pollen) assemblages collected from the same section using the same sampling regime: 67 sporomorph taxa were recorded from 50 samples taken at 10 cm intervals through the plant bed. Basic palynofacies analysis was also undertaken on each sample. Both dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil assemblages display consistent changes in composition, diversity (richness), and abundance through time. However, the dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil records provide conflicting evidence for the nature of parent vegetation. Specifically, conifers and ferns are underrepresented in plant megafossil assemblages, bryophytes and lycopsids are represented only in sporomorph assemblages, and sphenophytes, pteridosperms, Caytoniales, Cycadales, Ginkgoales and Bennettitales are comparatively underrepresented in sporomorph assemblages. Combined multivariate analysis (correspondence analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling) of sporomorph occurrence/abundance data demonstrates that temporal variation in sporomorph assemblages is the result of depositional change through the plant bed. The reproductive strategies of parent plants are considered to be a principal factor in shaping many of the major abundance and diversity irregularities between dispersed sporomorph and plant megafossil data sets that seemingly reflects different parent vegetation. Preferential occurrence/preservation of sporomorphs and equivalent parent plants is a consequence of a complex array of biological, ecological, geographical, taphonomic, and depositional factors that act inconsistently between and within fossil assemblages, which results in notable discrepancies between data sets.",2015

Although theoretical studies indicate that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, analyses of larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the pervasiveness of coexistence. In this paper, we analyze 175 ecological bipartite networks of three interaction types (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator), and measure the extent to which these communities are composed of species with different levels of specificity in their biotic interactions. We find a continuum from specialism to generalism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that diversity tends to be greatest in networks with intermediate connectance, and argue this is because of physical constraints in the filling of networks.",2015

Unregulated floodplains result in community composition responding directly to natural fluctuations in water level. This study assesses how hydrological factors and farming practices effect flood meadow plant communities. Three main plant communities were identified, forming an uninterrupted ecotone, along a gradient of dry to wet. Habitats of European conservation interest (Lowland Hay Meadows and Molinia Meadows) were well represented. Hydroperiod, calculated using microtopographical measurements, was the primary factor determining community composition and was negatively correlated with elevation and plant species richness. The botanical continuum comprised a range of insect-pollinated species, demonstrating the role of floodplains in providing pollinator services. Climate change projections indicate more prolonged winter flooding in the future, signifying potential range shifts for these plant species and communities; highlighting the need for appropriate conservation measures in the surrounding landscape. Low-intensity farming practices, with minimal fertiliser use and regular hay-mowing, played an essential, secondary role in maintaining plant species diversity. Retaining the floodplain topography, its associated hydrological regime and low-intensity farming practices, are necessary to maintain species diversity and ecosystem services.",2015

Identifying how structural differences between plantations and natural vegetation influence pollinator communities is necessary for ecological management of agroecosystems. Communities of potential wild pollinators (native bees, wasps, flies) were compared between monoculture almond plantations and native vegetation in a semi-arid region of southern Australia, before, during and after the late winter almond flowering period. Abundance and richness of each insect group were related to site heterogeneity and keystone structural resources at each site, focusing on food and nesting resources. Relationships with site heterogeneity varied between taxa and across months. Native bee abundance and richness were strongly associated with specific keystone resources, despite showing no association with site heterogeneity. The present study highlights the value of focusing on biologically meaningful resources when investigating relationships between insects and habitat, rather than on generalized heterogeneity metrics. The results suggest that maintaining keystone resources in agroecosystems can support the conservation of insects and ecosystem services, especially in areas where homogeneous agricultural systems overlap dynamic natural ecosystems.",2015

However, despite a number of ESV-inspired sustainability initiatives since the 1990s, global ecological degradation continues to accelerate. This suggests that ESV has fallen far short of its goals of sustainable social transformation a failure which has generated considerable criticism. This paper reviews three prominent lines of ESV criticism: 1) the neo-Marxist criticism, which emphasizes the ""fictitious"" character of ecosystem commodities; 2) the liberal criticism through Friedrich Hayek's concept ""scientistic objectivism""; and 3) the pragmatist criticism of ""value monism"". Although each form of criticism provides insight into the limitations of ESV, all share ESV's inability to discern what kind of social transformation is possible. Unable to provide an account of their own immersion in social and historical context, these approaches operate in the hypothetical. In light of these shortcomings, this paper advances a critical theory approach, which we contend provides conceptual tools uniquely well-suited to more adequately address the question of social transformation.

The effect of this management on forest Lepidoptera is poorly known. The present study aimed to determine whether forest lepidopteran diversity and species composition were affected by two silvicultural disturbances: timber harvest and post-logging removal of coarse woody debris>10.0cm in diameter. In 2014, Lepidoptera were sampled from nine forest stands subject to one of three management treatments: control (no manipulation at all), clear cut and partial retention of coarse woody debris (80% removal), and clear cut and complete removal of coarse woody debris. As expected, species richness and composition were significantly impacted by timber harvest. Subsequent removal of 80% or 100% coarse woody debris, however, did not affect specialists, detritivores and pollinators. The absence of an effect as a result of the removal of coarse woody debris could be a result of the limited number of replicate stands, small stand size and the limited range of retention treatments. We suggest, however, that retention of fine woody debris with a diameter<10.0cm and inclusion of unlogged stands in the forest landscape maintains some of the habitat elements necessary for Lepidoptera.",2015
miRNAs play essential roles in the floral thermogenesis of Magnolia denudata (Magnoliaceae),Basal angiosperm; Floral stage; Floral thermogenesis; High-throughput sequencing; miRNA,CABBAGE SYMPLOCARPUS-RENIFOLIUS; SACRED LOTUS; TEMPERATURE REGULATION; ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY; FLOWER DEVELOPMENT; SMALL RNAS; MICRORNAS; RESPIRATION; EXPRESSION; PATTERNS,"High-throughput sequencing and subsequent analysis indicated that miRNAs play crucial roles in floral thermogenesis of Magnolia denudata flowers. Animal-like thermogenic activity in flowers has been reported in several families of seed plants. Many studies have explored the ecological significance of thermogenesis in pollination biology; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating floral thermogenesis remain unclear. To characterize the roles of miRNA in floral thermogenesis, we analyzed miRNA expression in Magnolia denudata flowers during thermogenic and non-thermogenic stages. High-throughput sequencing and subsequent analysis revealed 82 conserved and 32 novel miRNAs in M. denudata flowers. A total of 187 EST sequences were predicted to be targets of 63 miRNAs. The target genes fell into 15 KOG functional classes and were involved in 25 KEGG pathways, suggesting that miRNAs play extensive regulatory roles in biological processes of M. denudata flowers. Among the identified miRNAs, 17 were differentially expressed between thermogenic and non-thermogenic stages and thus were thought to play roles in regulating floral thermogenesis in M. denudata. GO enrichment analysis revealed that target genes of these thermogenesis-related miRNAs were enriched in the functional groups 'polyprenyl transferase activity' and 'photosynthetic electron transport'. Considering the important roles of polyprenyl transferase in the respiratory chain and the fact that floral thermogenesis of M. denudata flowers is associated with sunlight, we can infer that miRNAs play crucial roles in floral thermogenesis of M. denudata flowers by regulating cellular respiration and light reactions.",2015
Global exchange and accumulation of non-native plants,,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ANTHROPOCENE; INVASIBILITY; PERSPECTIVES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ISLAND; FLORA; US,"All around the globe, humans have greatly altered the abiotic and biotic environment with ever-increasing speed. One defining feature of the Anthropocene epoch (1,2) is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological, economic and social damage (3). So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between continents has been performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species, corresponding to 3.9% of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the size of the native European flora, have become naturalized somewhere on the globe as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in species numbers with respect to their land area.

Here, we develop the first global assessment of trends in pollinators, focusing on pollinating birds and mammals. A Red List Index for these species shows that, overall, pollinating bird and mammal species are deteriorating in status, with more species moving toward extinction than away from it. On average, 2.5 species per year have moved one Red List category toward extinction in recent decades, representing a substantial increase in the extinction risk across this set of species. This may be impacting the delivery of benefits that these species provide to people. We recommend that the index be expanded to include taxonomic groups that contribute more significantly to pollination, such as bees, wasps, and butterflies, thereby giving a more complete picture of the state of pollinating species worldwide.",2015

Although ecologists and evolutionary biologists widely recognize the potential impacts of changes in average climatic conditions, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of changes in climatic variability and extremes. We review the evidence on the impacts of increased climatic variability and extremes on physiological, ecological and evolutionary processes at multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations and communities. Our review indicates that climatic variability can have profound influences on biological processes at multiple scales of organization. Responses to increased climatic variability and extremes are likely to be complex and cannot always be generalized, although our conceptual and methodological toolboxes allow us to make informed predictions about the likely consequences of such climatic changes. We conclude that climatic variability represents an important component of climate that deserves further attention.",2017
Phylogenomic Insights into the Evolution of Stinging Wasps and the Origins of Ants and Bees,,ULTRACONSERVED ELEMENTS; PARTITIONING SCHEMES; HYMENOPTERA; SUPERFAMILY; THOUSANDS; INFERENCE; SELECTION; HUNDREDS; SISTER; TOOL,"The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant inmost terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4-11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5-7]. We used ultra-conserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from >800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.",2017
Comparative toxicity of pesticides and environmental contaminants in bees: Are honey bees a useful proxy for wild bee species?,Apis; Bombus; Osmia; Neonicotinoid; Trace metal; DEBtox,APIS-MELLIFERA; INSECTICIDES; HYMENOPTERA; SENSITIVITY; EXPOSURE; VULNERABILITY; APIDAE; ROUTE; RATES; TIME,"Threats to wild and managed insect pollinators in Europe are cause for both ecological and socio-economic concern. Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (<2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (>25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals. ",2017
Interaction rewiring and the rapid turnover of plant-pollinator networks,Adaptive foraging; beta-diversity; community composition; food webs; interaction turnover; mutualism; networks; null models; optimal foraging theory; phenology,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; TROPHIC NETWORKS; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; SIZE; DIVERSITY; PHENOLOGY; ECOLOGY,"Whether species interactions are static or change over time has wide-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, species interaction networks are typically constructed from temporally aggregated interaction data, thereby implicitly assuming that interactions are fixed. This approach has advanced our understanding of communities, but it obscures the timescale at which interactions form (or dissolve) and the drivers and consequences of such dynamics. We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the within-season turnover of plant-pollinator interactions from weekly censuses across 3years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that species' phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total interaction turnover and rewiring. Our findings reveal the diversity of species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of networks are ignored.",2017

However, the current model of agricultural intensification which produces high yields has also resulted in a loss of biodiversity, ecological function, and critical ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. A key consequence of agricultural intensification is landscape simplification, where once heterogeneous landscapes contain increasingly fewer crop and non-crop habitats. Landscape simplification exacerbates biodiversity losses which leads to reductions in ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. In recent decades, considerable research has focused on mitigating these negative impacts, primarily via management of habitats to promote biodiversity and enhance services at the local scale. While it is well known that local and landscape factors interact, modifying overall landscape structure is seldom considered due to logistical constraints. I propose that the loss of ecosystem services due to landscape simplification can only be addressed by a concerted effort to fundamentally redesign agricultural landscapes. Designing agricultural landscapes will require that scientists work with stakeholders to determine the mix of desired ecosystem services, evaluate current landscape structure in light of those goals, and implement targeted modifications to achieve them. I evaluate the current status of landscape design, ranging from fundamental ecological principles to resulting guidelines and socioeconomic tools. While research gaps remain, the time is right for ecologists to engage with other disciplines, stakeholders, and policymakers in education and advocacy to foster agricultural landscape design for sustainable and resilient biodiversity services.

To better understand citizen scientists' motivations and how they benefit from their participation, we surveyed volunteers in the Great Pollinator Project, a conservation-related project in New York City. We conducted pre- and post-season surveys and focus group sessions to find out who the active volunteers were, their reasons for joining, what benefits of participation they experienced, as well as challenges they encountered collecting and submitting data. In comparison with results of several surveys of environmental and conservation volunteers, we found a similar range of motivators. However, while studies of motivations of environmental volunteers have indicated helping the environment as the strongest factor, interest in learning about bees the subject of the study was the top motivation of our citizen science volunteers. Helping or contributing to science was the second most cited motivator for participants in the project. Less strong were outdoor/recreation and social factors. We discuss some of the steps we took in response to participants' feedback in order to improve volunteer recruitment and retention. We also make additional recommendations for project design and research to enhance understanding of volunteer motivations, which will benefit volunteers themselves as well as strengthen their contribution to conservation outcomes.

During the last decade, large amounts of genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data have been generated with this plant which has provided new insights into how native plants interact with herbivores, pollinators and microbes. However, an integrative and open access platform that allows for the efficient mining of these - omics data remained unavailable until now. Description: We present the Nicotiana attenuata Data Hub (NaDH) as a centralized platform for integrating and visualizing genomic, phylogenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data in N. attenuata. The NaDH currently hosts collections of predicted protein coding sequences of 11 plant species, including two recently sequenced Nicotiana species, and their functional annotations, 222 microarray datasets from 10 different experiments, a transcriptomic atlas based on 20 RNA-seq expression profiles and a metabolomic atlas based on 895 metabolite spectra analyzed by mass spectrometry. We implemented several visualization tools, including a modified version of the Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (eFP) browser, co-expression networks and the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) for studying gene expression divergence among duplicated homologous. In addition, the NaDH allows researchers to query phylogenetic trees of 16,305 gene families and provides tools for analyzing their evolutionary history. Furthermore, we also implemented tools to identify co-expressed genes and metabolites, which can be used for predicting the functions of genes. Using the transcription factor NaMYB8 as an example, we illustrate that the tools and data in NaDH can facilitate identification of candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites. Conclusion: The NaDH provides interactive visualization and data analysis tools that integrate the expression and evolutionary history of genes in Nicotiana, which can facilitate rapid gene discovery and comparative genomic analysis. Because N. attenuata shares many genome-wide features with other Nicotiana species including cultivated tobacco, and hence NaDH can be a resource for exploring the function and evolution of genes in Nicotiana species in general.

Impact of controlled neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees in a realistic field setting,Bombus terrestris audax; bumblebees; clothianidin; colony growth; ecotoxicological guidelines; field setting; foraging ecology; neonicotinoid; pesticide; pollinators,SEED-TREATED CANOLA; HONEY-BEES; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; COLONY GROWTH; WILD BEES; CLOTHIANIDIN; POLLINATORS; POLLEN,"Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

The North Atlantic Oscillation synchronises fruit production in western European forests,,NINO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; SPATIAL SYNCHRONY; MASTING BEHAVIOR; ACORN PRODUCTION; AIRBORNE POLLEN; LOCAL WEATHER; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY,"Weather and its lagged effects have been associated with interannual variability and synchrony of fruit production for several tree species. Such relationships are used often in hypotheses relating interannual variability in fruit production with tree resources or favourable pollinating conditions and with synchrony in fruit production among sites through the Moran effect (the synchronisation of biological processes among populations driven by meteorological variability) or the local availability of pollen. Climatic teleconnections, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), representing weather packages, however, have rarely been correlated with fruit production, despite often being better predictors of ecological processes than is local weather. The aim of this study was to test the utility of seasonal NAO indices for predicting interannual variability and synchrony in fruit production using data from 76 forests of Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus petraea, and Q. robur distributed across central Europe. Interannual variability in fruit production for all species was significantly correlated with seasonal NAO indices, which were more prominently important predictors than local meteorological variables. The relationships identified by these analyses indicated that proximal causes were mostly responsible for the interannual variability in fruit production, supporting the premise that local tree resources and favourable pollinating conditions are needed to produce large fruit crops. Synchrony in fruit production between forests was mainly associated with weather and geographical distance among sites. Also, fruit production for a given year was less variable among sites during warm and dry springs ( negative spring NAO phases). Our results identify the Moran effect as the most likely mechanism for synchronisation of fruit production at large geographical scales and the possibility that pollen availability plays a role in synchronising fruit production at local scales. Our results highlight the influence of the NAO on the patterns of fruit production across western Europe.",2017

Interest has focused on biological pollinators while their effects on other organisms that are key contributors to the ecosystem remain largely unknown. To advance this, we have tested the effects of representatives of three major classes of neonicotinoids, thiacloprid, clothianidin and nitenpyram, on the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), as a representative of the Nematoda, an ecologically important phylum contributing to biomass. RESULTS: Concentrations that are several-fold higher than those with effects against target species had limited impact on locomotor function. However, increased potency was observed in a mutant with a hyperpermeable cuticle, which shows that drug access limits the effects of the neonicotinoids in C. elegans. Thiacloprid was most potent (EC50 714. mu M). In addition, it selectively delayed larval development in wild-type worms at 1mM. CONCLUSION: C. elegans is less susceptible to neonicotinoids than target species of pest insect. We discuss an approach in which this defined low sensitivity may be exploited by heterologous expression of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors from both pest and beneficial insects in transgenic C. elegans with increased cuticle permeability to provide a whole organism assay for species-dependent neonicotinoid effects.

Despite the potential for these mechanisms to create conditions under which the loss of one competitor triggers the loss of others, we lack the knowledge needed to judge their importance for coexistence in nature. Progress requires borrowing insight from the study of multitrophic interaction networks, and coupling empirical data to models of competition.",2017

Genomic tools can also revolutionize novel research in bee conservation and management, including the identification of loci underlying adaptive and economically desirable traits, such as those involved in disease susceptibility, responses to multiple environmental stressors, and even discovering and understanding the hidden diversity of beneficial microorganisms associated with bees.

Se is essential for many species, including humans, but toxic at elevated concentrations. Plant Se accumulation and volatilization may be applied in crop biofortification and phytoremediation. Topics covered here include beneficial and toxic effects of Se on plants, mechanisms of Se accumulation and tolerance in plants and algae, Se hyperaccumulation, and ecological and evolutionary aspects of these processes. Plant species differ in the concentration and forms of Se accumulated, Se partitioning at the whole-plant and tissue levels, and the capacity to distinguish Se from sulfur. Mechanisms of Se hyperaccumulation and its adaptive significance appear to involve constitutive up-regulation of sulfate/selenate uptake and assimilation, associated with elevated concentrations of defense-related hormones. Hyperaccumulation has evolved independently in at least three plant families, probably as an elemental defense mechanism and perhaps mediating elemental allelopathy. Elevated plant Se protects plants from generalist herbivores and pathogens, but also gives rise to the evolution of Seresistant specialists. Plant Se accumulation affects ecological interactions with herbivores, pollinators, neighboring plants, and microbes. Hyperaccumulation tends to negatively affect Sesensitive ecological partners while facilitating Se-resistant partners, potentially affecting species composition and Se cycling in seleniferous ecosystems.",2017

To address this knowledge gap, we determined the amounts and temporal (daily and lifetime) schedules of pollen consumption by freely nesting, adult females of the alkali bee (Nomia melanderi, Halictidae). Nesting females of known ages were taken at different hours of the day from nesting aggregations managed for alfalfa pollination in southeastern Washington State (USA). Each dissected bee was visually scored for pollen fill of the crop, midgut, and hindgut; we also quantified the crop's pollen capacity. Our dissections of 188 bees show that adult females ate pollen daily for at least the first 2 weeks following emergence. Most bees (85 %) had pollen boluses in one or more gut regions, indicating active pollen feeding. Pollen masses were most likely in the midgut; the daily volume consumed usually filled both the crop and midgut at least once. Full crops contained 34,000 alfalfa pollen grains, equivalent to < 20 % of a full scopal load and 0.8 % of the pollen in a nest provision. Proportionately more females ate pollen as the day progressed, indicated by pollen masses in the crop. By early evening, crops of all bees were filled with pollen. Our study reveals the dietary importance of regular pollen feeding for nesting adult female solitary bees, and not just their larvae, with implications for bee foraging ecology, dietary physiology, reproduction, toxicology, and pollination ecology.",2017

Peak oil yields of 12tha(-1) yr(-1) have been achieved in small plantations, and maximum theoretical yields as calculated with simulation models are 18.5 t oil ha(-1) yr(-1), yet average productivity worldwide has stagnated around 3 t oil ha(-1) yr(-1). Considering the threat of expansion into valuable rainforests, it is important that the factors underlying these existing yield gaps are understood and, where feasible, addressed. In this review, we present an overview of the available data on yield determining, yield-limiting, and yield-reducing factors in oil palm; the effects of these factors on yield, as measured in case studies or calculated using computer models; and the underlying plant-physiological mechanisms. We distinguish four production levels: the potential, water-limited, nutrient-limited, and the actual yield. The potential yield over a plantation lifetime is determined by incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and planting material, assuming optimum plantation establishment, planting density (120-150 palms per hectares), canopy management (30-60 leaves depending on palm age), pollination, and harvesting. Water-limited yields in environments with water deficits >400 mm year(-1) can be less than one-third of the potential yield, depending on additional factors such as temperature, wind speed, soil texture, and soil depth. Nutrient limited yields of less than 50% of the potential yield have been recorded when nitrogen or potassium were not applied. Actual yields are influenced by yield-reducing factors such as unsuitable ground vegetation, pests, and diseases, and may be close to zero in case of severe infestations. Smallholders face particular constraints such as the use of counterfeit seed and insufficient fertiliser application. Closing yield gaps in existing plantations could increase global production by 15-20 Mt oil yr(-1), which would limit the drive for further area expansion at a global scale. To increase yields in existing and future plantations in a sustainable way, all production factors mentioned need to be understood and addressed. ",2017

Assessments based on functional traits may help with interpreting variability in both community composition and ecosystem functioning because of their mechanistic and generalizable nature. This promise remains poorly realized, however, because tests linking environmental conditions, functional traits, and ecosystem functioning in restoration are rare. Here, we provide such a test through what is to our knowledge the first empirical application of the response-effect trait framework' to restoration. This framework provides a trait-based bridge between community assembly and ecosystem functioning by describing how species respond to environmental conditions based on traits and how the traits of species affect ecosystem functioning. Our study took place across 29 prairies restored from former agricultural fields in southwestern Michigan. We considered how environmental conditions affect ecosystem functioning through and independently of measured functional traits. To do so, we paired field-collected trait data with data on plant community composition and measures of ecosystem functioning and used structural equationmodelling to determine relationships between environmental conditions, community-weighted means of functional traits and ecosystem functioning. Environmental conditions were predictive of trait composition. Sites restored directly from tillage (as opposed to those allowed to fallow) supported taller species with larger seeds and higher specific leaf area (SLA). Site age and fire frequency were both negatively related to SLA. We also found a positive relationship between soil moisture and SLA. Both trait composition and environmental conditions predicted ecosystem functioning, but these relationships varied among the measured functions. Pollination mode (animal pollination) increased and fire frequency decreased floral resource availability, seed mass had a negative effect on below-ground biomass production, and vegetative height increased decomposition rate. Soil moisture and fire frequency both increased while site age decreased above-ground biomass production, and site age and soil moisture both increased decomposition rate.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both trait composition and environmental conditions play a role in shaping ecosystem function during restoration, and the importance of each is dependent on the function of interest. Because of this, environmental heterogeneity will be necessary to promote multiple ecosystem functions across restored landscapes. A trait-based approach to restoration can aid interpretation of variable outcomes through insights into community assembly and ecosystem functioning.

Until recently, few ecologists were employing chemical approaches to investigate mechanisms by which components of environmental change may disrupt these essential mutualisms. In an attempt to make these approaches more accessible, we summarize the main field, laboratory, and statistical methods involved in capturing, quantifying, and analyzing floral VOCs in the context of changing environments.

Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment testing the impacts of field relevant doses (1.87-5.32 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species, suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all four species. In addition to providing the first evidence for general effects of neonicotinoids on ovary development in multiple species of wild bumblebee queens, the discovery of species-specific effects on feeding has significant implications for current practices and policy for pesticide risk assessment and use.",2017
Ecological intensification to mitigate impacts of conventional intensive land use on pollinators and pollination,Crop production; diversification; food security; grazing/mowing intensity; habitat loss; landscape fragmentation; mass-flowering crops; wild pollinator diversity,MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; ARABLE FIELD MARGINS; CAVITY-NESTING BEES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; OILSEED RAPE; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; SPECIES RICHNESS,"Worldwide, human appropriation of ecosystems is disrupting plant-pollinator communities and pollination function through habitat conversion and landscape homogenisation. Conversion to agriculture is destroying and degrading semi-natural ecosystems while conventional land-use intensification (e.g. industrial management of large-scale monocultures with high chemical inputs) homogenises landscape structure and quality. Together, these anthropogenic processes reduce the connectivity of populations and erode floral and nesting resources to undermine pollinator abundance and diversity, and ultimately pollination services. Ecological intensification of agriculture represents a strategic alternative to ameliorate these drivers of pollinator decline while supporting sustainable food production, by promoting biodiversity beneficial to agricultural production through management practices such as intercropping, crop rotations, farm-level diversification and reduced agrochemical use. We critically evaluate its potential to address and reverse the land use and management trends currently degrading pollinator communities and potentially causing widespread pollination deficits. We find that many of the practices that constitute ecological intensification can contribute to mitigating the drivers of pollinator decline. Our findings support ecological intensification as a solution to pollinator declines, and we discuss ways to promote it in agricultural policy and practice.",2017

These traits are underpinned by the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as pigments and volatiles, as well as carbohydrates and amino acids, which are used by plants to lure and reward animal pollinators. We review here the knowledge of the metabolic network that supports the biosynthesis of these compounds and the behavioral responses that these molecules elicit in the animal pollinators. Such knowledge provides us with a deeper insight into the ecology and evolution of plant pollinator interactions, and should help us to better manage these ecologically essential interactions in agricultural ecosystems.",2017
Assessing the ecological significance of bee visual detection and colour discrimination on the evolution of flower colours,Behaviour; Computer simulation; Plant phylogeny; Vision; Y-maze,CHROMATIC PROPERTIES; OPTIC LOBES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; FLORAL COLOR; UNIQUE HUES; HONEY-BEES; VISION; POLLINATORS; INTERNEURONS,"Bee pollinators interact with flowers in a complex signal-receiver system. Chromatic traits that allow reliable discrimination between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers have been proposed as an important feature of pollination syndromes: bee-pollinated flowers have spectral profiles that closely match the discrimination peaks of their pollinators across the visual spectrum. However, in the complexity of a natural environment, it may be hard for bees to even detect the presence of flowers. In particular, little is known about how discrimination and detection by bees may together contribute to pollinator-mediated selection on floral colour signals. We address here an unexplained feature of floral colour evolution: the extreme paucity of spectral patterns with pronounced changes in reflectance around 420-480 nm wavelength. We began by conducting experiments with honeybees in a Y-maze to determine their capacity to detect a stimulus rarely found in bee-pollinated flowers-one with a single sharp spectral reflectance change at 478 nm. We found bees to be poor at detecting this stimulus against a neutral background. We then conducted behaviourally-informed computer simulations that test how bee visual discrimination and detection interact, which yielded information about which flower colours most effectively facilitate cross-pollination. Finally, we identified from our previous work those bird-pollinated species whose floral colours had spectral characteristics similar to the stimulus used in the Y-maze experiment. These data demonstrate that plants can, and do, produce such spectra for pollinators other than bees. In combination, our results show that the interaction between colour discrimination and detection is important for understanding flower community assembly.",2017
Costs of selfing prevent the spread of a self-compatibility mutation that causes reproductive assurance,Automatic selection; inbreeding depression; outcrossing; seed discounting; self-fertilization; self-incompatibility,LEAVENWORTHIA-ALABAMICA BRASSICACEAE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; MATING SYSTEMS; GENETIC-VARIATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; POPULATION-SIZE; EVOLUTION; INCOMPATIBILITY; FERTILIZATION; PLANTS,"In flowering plants, shifts from outcrossing to partial or complete self-fertilization have occurred independently thousands of times, yet the underlying adaptive processes are difficult to discern. Selfing's ability to provide reproductive assurance when pollination is uncertain is an oft-cited ecological explanation for its evolution, but this benefit may be outweighed by costs diminishing its selective advantage over outcrossing. We directly studied the fitness effects of a self-compatibility mutation that was backcrossed into a self-incompatible (SI) population of Leavenworthia alabamica, illuminating the direction and magnitude of selection on the mating-system modifier. In array experiments conducted in two years, self-compatible (SC) plants produced 17-26% more seed, but this advantage was counteracted by extensive seed discountingthe replacement of high-quality outcrossed seeds by selfed seeds. Using a simple model and simulations, we demonstrate that SC mutations with these attributes rarely spread to high frequency in natural populations, unless inbreeding depression falls below a threshold value (0.57 (threshold) 0.70) in SI populations. A combination of heavy seed discounting and inbreeding depression likely explains why outcrossing adaptations such as self-incompatibility are maintained generally, despite persistent input of selfing mutations, and frequent limits on outcross seed production in nature.",2017
Integrating intraspecific variation in community ecology unifies theories on body size shifts along climatic gradients,bees; Bergmann's rule; community assemblages; elevational gradient; environmental filtering; functional traits; interspecific variation; Mount Kilimanjaro; niche breadth; tropical mountains,FOLLOW BERGMANNS RULE; SPECIES RICHNESS; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENTS; POPULATION-DENSITY; BEE DIVERSITY; NORTH-AMERICA; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; MAMMALS; VARIABILITY,"Physiological and energetic mechanisms have been proposed to constrain body sizes of organisms along climatic gradients; however, these provide contrasting predictions. While Bergmann's rule predicts increases in body sizes in cooler climates resulting from physiological constraints, energy-based community assembly rules suggest declines in the mean body size of species caused by increased extinction probabilities for large-bodied species in low-energy habitats. We tested these contrasting hypotheses by quantifying trait distributions in bee communities along a 36-km elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro. Traditionally, intra- and interspecific trait shifts along environmental gradients have been investigated in isolation. However, a surge of theoretical approaches and studies on plants demonstrated that the explicit integration of trait variation among and within species can be essential for identifying the mechanisms that shape traits and related ecosystem functions along environmental gradients. We therefore studied variation in body size and related morphological traits at both the intra- and interspecific level. We found support for both physiological constraints and energy-based community assembly rules as drivers of trait distribution in bee communities along elevational gradients, which, however, affected different levels of biotic organization, that is the population and community level. While the number of bee species with large body sizes declined with elevation, individuals within species became on average larger, resulting in contrasting trends in morphometric parameters at the community versus population level. Furthermore, body size within bee communities became less variable at higher elevations, largely as a result of a non-random, directive loss of species, but paralleled by a decline in intraspecific variance, suggesting intensified filtering effects with increasing elevation. Similar patterns were found for other functional traits related to the foraging ecology of bees (tongue length, relative forewing length). We conclude that along climatic gradients both physiological and energetic constraints shape trait distributions of pollinators, but at different levels of biological organization.",2017
Diversification of Caiophora (Loasaceae subfam.

The angiosperm genus Caiophora (Loasaceae, subfam. Loasoideae) comprises around 50 species that are endemic to South America. These are distributed from southern Ecuador to Central Chile and Argentina. Bee pollination and distribution at low-intermediate elevations probably represent the ancestral condition in the lineage that includes Caiophora and its allied genera. The majority of Caiophora species grow at high elevations in the Andes, where some depend on vertebrate pollination. Previous studies did not resolve phylogenetic relationships within Caiophora, which precluded the dating of the origin and divergence of this group. We used markers of one nuclear (ITS) and one plastid region (trnS (GCU) -trnG (UUC) ) to solve phylogenetic relationships among 19 Caiophora species (including different accessions). We also included 10 species of the allied genera Blumenbachia and Loasa. Aosa rostrata and Xylopodia klaprothioides were used as outgroups. Phylogenetic reconstruction strongly supports the monophyly of Caiophora, and although several clades within this genus are poorly supported, our study yielded a better infra-generic resolution than previous studies. The origin of Caiophora is dated to the Early-Middle Miocene and can be related to the uplift of the Cordilleras Frontal and Principal and to Pacific marine transgressions. According to our estimations, Caiophora began to diversify during the Middle-Late Miocene and this unfolding proceeded eastwards during the Pliocene and the Pleistocene, in parallel to the uplift of different Andean mountain ranges.",2017
Persistent bill and corolla matching despite shifting temporal resources in tropical hummingbird-plant interactions,Co-evolution; Ecuador; hummingbirds; networks; species interactions,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SEED DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; BIRDS; EVOLUTION; SIZE,"By specialising on specific resources, species evolve advantageous morphologies to increase the efficiency of nutrient acquisition. However, many specialists face variation in resource availability and composition. Whether specialists respond to these changes depends on the composition of the resource pulses, the cost of foraging on poorly matched resources, and the strength of interspecific competition. We studied hummingbird bill and plant corolla matching during seasonal variation in flower availability and morphology. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we accounted for the detectability and spatial overlap of hummingbird-plant interactions. We found that despite seasonal pulses of flowers with short-corollas, hummingbirds consistently foraged on well-matched flowers, leading to low niche overlap. This behaviour suggests that the costs of searching for rare and more specialised resources are lower than the benefit of switching to super-abundant resources. Our results highlight the trade-off between foraging efficiency and interspecific competition, and underline niche partitioning in maintaining tropical diversity.",2017

The abundance and diversity of native bee species in urban landscapes that are absent in nearby rural lands evidence the biological value and ecological importance of cities and have implications for biodiversity conservation. Lagging behind this revised image of the city are urban conservation programs that historically have invested in education and outreach rather than programs designed to achieve high-priority species conservation results. We synthesized research on urban bee species diversity and abundance to determine how urban conservation could be repositioned to better align with new views on the ecological importance of urban landscapes. Due to insect pollinators' relatively small functional requirementshabitat range, life cycle, and nesting behaviorrelative to larger mammals, we argue that pollinators put high-priority and high-impact urban conservation within reach. In a rapidly urbanizing world, transforming how environmental managers view the city can improve citizen engagement and contribute to the development of more sustainable urbanization.",2017

Genome scans are routinely used to explore genome-wide variation and identify highly differentiated loci that may contribute to ecological divergence, but they do not incorporate spatial, phenotypic or environmental data that might enhance outlier detection. Geographic cline analysis provides a potential framework for integrating diverse forms of data in a spatially explicit framework, but has not been used to study genome-wide patterns of divergence. Aided by a first-draft genome assembly, we combined an F-CT scan and geographic cline analysis to characterize patterns of genome-wide divergence between divergent pollination ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. F-CT analysis of 58 872 SNPs generated via RAD-seq revealed little ecotypic differentiation (mean F-CT = 0.041), although a small number of loci were moderately-to-highly diverged. Consistent with our previous results from the gene MaMyb2, which contributes to differences in flower colour, 130 loci have cline shapes that recapitulate the spatial pattern of trait divergence, suggesting that they may reside in or near the genomic regions that contribute to pollinator isolation. In the narrow hybrid zone between the ecotypes, extensive admixture among individuals and low linkage disequilibrium between markers indicate that most outlier loci are scattered throughout the genome, rather than being restricted to one or a few divergent regions. In addition to revealing the genomic consequences of ecological divergence in this system, we discuss how geographic cline analysis is a powerful but under-utilized framework for studying genome-wide patterns of divergence.",2017
Using BEEHAVE to explore pesticide protection goals for European honeybee (Apis melifera L.) worker losses at different forage qualities,Pesticide risk assessment; Population modeling; Landscape ecology; Population-level effects; Mechanistic effect model; Pollinator,BEE COLONY LOSSES; FLORAL RESOURCES; CONSERVATION; MELLIFERA; DYNAMICS; DECLINES; BRITAIN; MODELS; FALL; USA,"Losses of honeybee colonies are intensely debated and although honeybees suffer multiple stressors, the main focus has been on pesticides. As a result, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) revised the guidance for pesticide risk assessment for honeybees. The European Food Safety Authority reported a protection goal of negligible effect at 7% of colony size and then used the Khoury honeybee colony model to set trigger values for forager losses. However, the Khoury model is very simplistic and simulates colonies in an idealized state. In the present study, the authors demonstrate how a more realistic published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, with a few simple changes, can be used to explore pesticide risks. The results show that forage availability interacts with pesticide-induced worker losses, and colony resilience increases with forage quality. Adding alternative unexposed forage to the landscape also substantially mitigates the effects of pesticide exposure. The results indicate that EFSA's reported protection goal of 7% of colony size and triggers for daily worker losses are overly conservative. The authors conclude that forage availability is critical for colony resilience and that with adequate forage the colonies are resilient to even high levels of worker losses. However, the authors recommend setting protection goals using suboptimal forage conditions to ensure conservatism and for such suboptimal forage, a total of 20% reduction in colony size was safe.

First the main parasites and pathogens of bees are described, as well as how they modify the foraging behaviour, learning and memory of their hosts. 4. Next, the various defence mechanisms developed by bees to mitigate these effects at both the individual and collective levels are examined. 5.

Here, we provide a functionally structured framework of the great variety of interspecific visual signals seen in nature, and then describe the different signalling mechanisms that have evolved in response to each of these functional requirements. We propose that interspecific visual signalling can be divided into six major functional categories: anti-predator, food acquisition, anti-parasite, host acquisition, reproductive and agonistic signalling, with each function enabled by several distinct mechanisms. We support our classification by reviewing the ecological and behavioural drivers of interspecific signalling in animals and plants, principally focusing on comparative studies that address large-scale patterns of diversity. Collating diverse examples of interspecific signalling into an organized set of functional and mechanistic categories places anachronistic behavioural and morphological labels in fresh context, clarifies terminology and redirects research effort towards understanding environmental influences driving interspecific signalling in nature.

Conflict over non-partitioned resources may explain between-species differences in declines: the anthropogenic competition hypothesis,Anthropogenic degradation; Competitive exclusion; Environmental change; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Pollinator conservation; Resource partitioning; Seasonal breeding; Species declines,NEST-SITE SELECTION; DARWINS NATURALIZATION HYPOTHESIS; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BUMBLE BEES HYMENOPTERA; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; EXPERIMENTAL REDUCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL TRAPS; FARMLAND BIRDS; GREAT TITS,"Human alterations of habitats are causing declines in many species worldwide. The extent of declines varies greatly among closely related species, for often unknown reasons that must be understood in order to maintain biodiversity. An overlooked factor is that seasonally breeding species compete for nest sites, which are increasingly limited in many anthropogenically degraded environments. I used evolutionary game theory to predict the outcome of competition between individuals that differ in their competitive ability and timing of nesting. A range of species following evolutionarily stable strategies can co-exist when there are sufficient nest sites, but my model predicts that a reduction in nest site availability has greater impacts on late-nesting species, especially the stronger competitors, whereas early-nesting, stronger species decline only slightly. These predictions are supported by data on 221 bird and 43 bumblebee species worldwide. Restoration and provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority in conservation efforts. More broadly, these results indicate a new ecological principle of potentially widespread importance: rapid reductions in the abundance of resources for which species' preferences have not diversified will result in unprecedented conflicts that reduce the potential for species co-existence. Significance statement Understanding the causes of species declines is crucial to preventing the losses. Whilst much work on species vulnerability shows broad scale effects, an enduring mystery is the variation in population trends between closely related species. I combined evolutionary modelling with three global- scale long- term data sets to reveal that competition for scarce nest sites causes variation in declines. The impact of the loss of nest sites on differential declines among closely related species from very different taxa indicates a new ecological principle of widespread importance: the effect of habitat degradation on competition among species. A lack of differentiation of nest site preferences means that- now nest sites are more limited- some species may be driving others to extinction. This phenomenon is likely to occur for any other nonpartitioned resources that rapidly, on an evolutionary timescale, are now limiting population sizes.",2017

Host discrimination mechanisms that reduce the fitness of uncooperative symbionts can stabilise mutualism against collapse, but also present a paradox - if discrimination is effective, why do uncooperative symbionts persist? Here, we test whether mutations or fitness benefits of cheating best explain the prevalence of uncooperative wasps in the fig tree-fig wasp mutualism. By combining theory with field-collected data we demonstrate that the proportions of pollen-free wasps of strongly discriminating hosts are reached with reasonable mutation rates. In contrast, in weakly discriminating hosts, the required mutation rates, assuming a single locus, are untenably high, but the required cheater advantages fall within expected ranges. We propose that when discrimination is weak, uncooperative symbionts proliferate until they reach the equilibrium proportion that balances costs and benefits of cheating. Our results suggest that mechanisms that resolve the paradox of uncooperative symbionts differ among host species.",2017
"Corona development and floral nectaries of Asclepiadeae (Asclepiadoideae, Apocynaceae)",asclepiads; histochemistry; ontogeny; nectar; structural diversity,POLLINATION; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ECOLOGY,"Flowers of Asclepiadoideae are notable for possessing numerous nectaries and elaborate coronas, where nectar can accumulate but is not necessarily produced. Given the complexity and importance of these structures for reproduction, this study aimed to analyze the ontogeny of the corona, the structure and position of nectaries and the histochemistry of the nectar of species of Asclepiadeae. Two types of coronas were observed: androecial [C(is)] and corolline (Ca). The development of the C(is)-type of corona initiates opposite the stamens in all species examined with the exception of Matelea in which it begins to develop as a ring around the filament tube. Despite their morphological variation, coronas typically originate from the androecium. A notable difference among the studied species was the location of the nectaries. Primarily, they are located in the stigmatic chamber, where nectar composed of carbohydrates and lipids is produced. A secondary location of nectaries found in species of Peplonia and Matelea is within the corona, where nectar is produced and stored, composed of carbohydrates and lipids in Peplonia and only carbohydrates in Matelea. The functional role of nectar is related to the location of its production since it is a resource for pollinators and inducers of pollen germination.",2017
Functional responses of contrasting seed predator guilds to masting in two Mediterranean oak species,,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; SATIATION HYPOTHESIS; REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT; ACORN PREDATION; POLLINATION; SELECTION; FORESTS; TREE; MECHANISMS; EFFICIENCY,"The predator satiation hypothesis poses that synchronous and variable seed production during masting events increases seed escape through seed predator satiation. The success of this strategy depends upon the type of consumer functional response, in this case defined as the change in seed consumption rate by a predator as a function of change in seed density. Type II (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at low levels of seed availability) and type III (where the proportion of seed consumed is highest at some intermediate level of seed availability and then declines towards zero) functional responses describe negative density-dependence and indicate predator satiation. The type of function response should be contingent upon herbivore traits: type II responses are predicted for dietary specialist predators with low mobility, and type III responses are predicted for highly mobile, dietary generalist predators. Surprisingly, most studies have not evaluated whether functional responses vary among seed predator guilds. Here we describe the functional responses at population and individual tree level of highly mobile generalist (birds and rodents) and less mobile specialist (insects) pre-dispersal seed predators attacking acorns of two sympatric oaks (Quercus suber and Q. canariensis) over a 10-year period. Our results showed that in most cases specialist seed predators exhibited the predicted type II functional response at both the individual tree and population level for both oak species. However, generalist seed predators did not exhibit the predicted type III response; instead, they also exhibited a type II response at the individual tree and population level for both oak species. By independently assessing the effects of multiple seed predators associated with the same host tree species, our work highlights the influence of herbivore traits on the outcome of plant-seed predator interactions in masting species, and thus furthers our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying masting behaviour.",2017

Even though the connections between polyploidy and species interactions have been recognized for some time, we are only just beginning to test whether WGD affects community context. Here I review the sparse information on polyploidy and community context and then present a set of hypotheses for future work. Thus far, community-level studies of polyploids suggest an array of outcomes, from no changes in community context to shifts in the abundance and composition of interacting species. I propose a number of mechanisms for how WGD could alter community context and how the emergence of polyploids in populations could also alter the community context of parental diploids and other plant species. Resolving how and when these changes are expected to occur will require a deeper understanding of the connections among WGD, phenotypic changes, and the direct and indirect effects of species interactions.",2017

However, there are in substantial decline worldwide, leading to serious threat to the stability and yield of food crops. Beekeeping is of pivotal importance, combining the wide economical aspect of honey production and the important ecological services provided by honeybees. In this scenario, the prompt identification of beekeeping areas is strategic, since it maximised productivity and lowered the risks of colony losses. Fuzzy logic is an ideal approach for problem-solving tasks, as it is specifically designed to manage problems with a high degree of uncertainty. This research tested a novel GIS-based approach to assess beekeeping suitability of lands located in Calabria (Southern Italy), without relying to Analytic Hierarchy Process - Multiple Criteria Decision Making (AHP-MCDM), thus avoiding the constraints due to the technique and decision makers' influences. Furthermore, the data used here were completely retrieved from open access sources, high-lighting that our approach is characterized by low costs and can be easily reproduced for a wide arrays of geographical contexts. Notably, the results obtained by our experiments were validated by the actual beekeeping reality. Besides beekeeping, the use of this system could not only be applied in beekeeping land suitability evaluations, but may be successfully extended to other types of land suitability evaluations.

As the primary adult food, nectar can limit butterfly longevity and reproduction. For pollinator restoration, it would therefore be useful to examine nectar resources. However, because many flowers preferred by butterflies are too small for microcapillary sampling and the potential for nectar contamination can make accurate measurement difficult, we developed a modified centrifugation method to extract and separate nectar and pollen. Methods: We sampled nectar from 19 forbs using a glass wool filter to exclude potentially contaminating pollen during centrifugation. To minimize costs, we measured sugar concentration by refractometry and simple ninhydrin tests for amino acids and improved test accuracy by subsequent image analysis. Artificial nectars were used to verify the new techniques. Results: This method eliminated pollen from samples, while only slightly increasing sugar concentrations. Some amino acids were lost during centrifugation, but only samples with high concentrations exhibited substantial loss. We found significant differences in nectar quality among species, as well as an unexpected inverse relationship between amino acid and sugar concentrations. Discussion: This modified centrifugation technique is an efficient, less damaging, inexpensive approach for collecting nectar from small flowers while eliminating pollen contamination, and will facilitate restoration of declining pollinators and thereby the plants they service.",2017

Nine field experiments were carried out in research stations and commercial farms located in Denmark, Germany, Italy and Slovenia. Farmers' perception of the feasibility and applicability of the LM technique was also assessed. The results demonstrated that the LM systems with a substitutive design can be effectively implemented in vegetable production if the value of the ecological services (positive externalities) delivered by LM can counterbalance the yield loss due to the cash crop density reduction. The crop density of the system and the length of the period in which the LM and cash crop coexist are oppositely related both for competition and yield. Moreover, if an additive design is used, the LM should be sown several weeks after the cash crop planting. Overall, different cash crop genotypes (i.e., open pollinated/local cultivars in comparison with the hybrids) performed similarly. Use of human labor (HL) and fossil fuel (FF) energy slightly increased in LM systems (7%), and there was a shift in the proportion of FF and human energy consumption. The farmers' acceptance of the LM techniques was quite high (75% of the interviewed sample), even though their critical considerations about yield quality and quantity need consideration in future research and practical implementation of LM systems.",2017

LM strips, while cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) was intercropped with a broad sowed burr medic (Medicago polimorpha L., var. anglona) in Italy. Two LM times of sowing relative to cash crop transplanting--an early sowing (es LM) and a late sowing (ls LM)--were compared with a control with no LM (no LM). The effects of LM treatment on crop competitiveness, LM smother effect and weed populations were evaluated by direct measurement, visual estimation and competitive index methods. Comparison among hybrid and open pollinated cultivar responses to LM introduction was also performed. Results showed a significant higher cash crop biomass in ls LM than in es LM, with comparable yield to the weeded controls, except for es LM in Italy. Moreover, in the Danish experiment, the LM and weed biomasses were up to 5 times lower in the es LM and ls LM treatments than the weed biomass alone in no LM treatment. Reduction in weed biomass and abundance was observed also in ls LM in the Italian trial. Similarly, the competitive balance (C-b), which quantifies the ability of the cash crop to compete with neighbours, was higher in the es LM (+0.29) and ls LM (+0.72) compared with unweeded no LM control (-0.86) in Denmark. In the Italian experiment, the cauliflower showed more competitive ability against neighbours in ls LM (+0.53) and was a weak competitor in es LM (-1.51). The cash crop had higher competitive ability against LM (C(b)c-lm) when sowing was more delayed in both experiments, while, in the Italian trial, the LM was more competitive against weeds (C(b)lm-w) in ls LM (+1.54) than in es LM (-0.41). The slight differences observed for biomass and competitive ability between the tested cultivars, highlighted similar suitability of both hybrid and open-pollinated cultivars to grow with LM. Our findings suggest the viability of the introduced LM in managing weeds and avoiding a smother effect on the crop, with particular effectiveness with delayed LM sowing.",2017
Detrimental interactions of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and bumblebee immunity,,HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; ECOLOGICAL IMMUNOLOGY; INSECT IMMUNITY; PARASITE EXPOSURE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; COLONY GROWTH; WILD BEES; POLLINATORS; SYSTEM,"Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects. However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.",2017
Patterns of population genetic structure and diversity across bumble bee communities in the Pacific Northwest,Bombus; Pollinator; Alpine; Isolation by distance; Olympic Mountains; Cascade Mountains; Pacific Northwest,MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; BOMBUS; CONSERVATION; SOFTWARE; DECLINE; DNA,"Patterns of genetic structure and diversity are largely mediated by a species' ecological niche and sensitivity to climate variation. Some species with narrow ecological niches have been found to exhibit increased population differentiation, limited gene flow across populations, and reduced population genetic diversity. In this study, we examine patterns of population genetic structure and diversity of four bumble bee species that are broadly sympatric, but do not necessarily inhabit the same ecological niche in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Testing for the effect of isolation by geographic distance (IBD) with linearized F-st and D-est found that Bombus sylvicola and B. mixtus exhibited significant IBD across populations. In contrast, both B. melanopygus and B. flavifrons, two species that are distributed across a broad elevation gradient, exhibited no IBD, a result further corroborated by Bayesian a priori population assignment tests. Furthermore, we discovered that B. sylvicola populations distributed on the Olympic Peninsula have significantly less average allelic diversity than populations distributed in the Cascade Mountains. Our results suggest that populations distributed in the Olympic Mountains represent a distinct genetic cluster relative to the Cascade Mountains, with B. sylvicola and B. mixtus likely experiencing the greatest degree of population genetic differentiation relative to B. flavifrons and B. melanopygus. While bumble bees are known to co-exist across a diversity of habitats, our results demonstrate that underlying population genetic structure and diversity may not necessarily be similar across species, and are largely governed by their respective niches.",2017

The rapid invasion of the intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora in China during the last 36 yr is a test case for the roles of these mechanisms. A previous study of S. alterniflora in China found strong latitudinal clines in vegetative and sexual traits and concluded that most of this variation was due to phenotypic plasticity. Recent observations suggested provenance-by-environment interactions, and we employed common gardens at multiple latitudes as a test of this idea. Phenotypically, field plant height, which correlates strongly with biomass and other indices of vegetative performance in this species, showed a hump-shaped relationship across 10 sites, covering 19 degrees of latitude; field seed set increased linearly with latitude. To assess the role of plasticity vs. genetic differentiation in these patterns, we grew plants from the ten field sites in three common gardens at low (20.9 degrees N), mid (28.3 degrees N), and high (38.0 degrees N) latitudes to maturity, at 18 months. Plant height varied among common gardens, with the tallest plants at mid latitude, mirroring the field pattern, consistent with the previous study. Within the gardens, latitude of origin also affected plant height. Seed set varied among the gardens, with the greatest values at high latitudes, again mirroring the field pattern and indicating substantial plasticity. Evidence of evolution was found as increasing seed set with latitude among provenances within common gardens. However, the effect differed among common gardens, with the greatest slope in the high-latitude garden, lower slope in the mid-latitude garden, and no relationship in the low-latitude garden, indicating a provenanceby- environment interaction. The number of surviving plants also suggested a provenance-byenvironment interaction; no relationship with latitude among provenances in the two southern gardens and increasing survival with latitude in the northern garden. Field seedling density was similar to 200-fold greater at high than at low latitude sites. The profuse seed germination and recruitment in the north could have created high selection intensity resulting in evolution of reproductive traits at high latitudes with the result that the mechanisms of the invasion differ with latitude.",2017

Inferring the foraging ranges of social bees from sibling genotypes sampled across discrete locations,Social bees; Foraging range estimation; Sibship reconstruction; Sampling design; Spatial analysis,DENSITY-ESTIMATION; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; NEST DENSITY; POLLINATION SERVICES; NATIVE BEES; BUMBLE BEES; HOME-RANGE; EXTINCTION; MODELS; SIZE,"A knowledge of the distances regularly travelled by foraging bees is essential to understanding the movement of pollen across landscapes, and has implications for the conservation of both pollinators and plants. Unfortunately, the movements of bees are difficult to measure directly at ecologically relevant scales. A common strategy for quantifying the foraging ranges of social bees is to sample the genotypes of foragers across a landscape. Individual foragers can be assigned to colonies with polymorphic genetic markers, and the dispersion of siblings in space can be used to make inference about colony locations and foraging movements. Several previous studies have sampled sibling genotypes at discrete locations (for example, at regular points along a transect), rather than in continuous space. Restricting the collection of bees to discrete locations presents a number of considerations for sampling design and data analysis. In this paper, we develop a spatially-explicit, model-based framework for the simulation and estimation of foraging ranges. Using these tools, we simulated experiments to characterise the efficacy of different sampling strategies, and provide an example with actual data that demonstrates the advantages of our method over an approach based on regression.",2017
Predicting cryptic links in host-parasite networks,,SPECIES RICHNESS; DISENTANGLING NESTEDNESS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MODULARITY; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; PITFALLS; MODELS; RISK,"Networks are a way to represent interactions among one (e.g., social networks) or more (e.g., plant-pollinator networks) classes of nodes. The ability to predict likely, but unobserved, interactions has generated a great deal of interest, and is sometimes referred to as the link prediction problem. However, most studies of link prediction have focused on social networks, and have assumed a completely censused network. In biological networks, it is unlikely that all interactions are censused, and ignoring incomplete detection of interactions may lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. Previous attempts to predict network interactions have relied on known properties of network structure, making the approach sensitive to observation errors. This is an obvious shortcoming, as networks are dynamic, and sometimes not well sampled, leading to incomplete detection of links. Here, we develop an algorithm to predict missing links based on conditional probability estimation and associated, node-level features. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and then apply it to a desert small mammal host-parasite network. Our approach achieves high accuracy on simulated and observed data, providing a simple method to accurately predict missing links in networks without relying on prior knowledge about network structure.",2017

Phenological data have generally been treated as purely temporal, with scant attention to the inherent spatial aspects of such data. However, phenological data are tied to a specific location, and considerations of sampling design, both over space and through time, can critically affect the patterns that emerge. Focusing on flowering phenology, we describe how purely spatial shifts, such as adding new study plots, or the colonization of a study plot by a new species, can masquerade as temporal shifts. Such shifts can look like responses to climate change but are not. Furthermore, the same aggregate phenological curves can be composed of individuals with either very different or very similar phenologies. We conclude with a set of recommendations to avoid ambiguities arising from the spatiotemporal duality of phenological data.",2017

Like other dihydroxy B-ring substituted flavonoids, ACNs have an ability to bind metal and metalloid ions, a property that has been exploited for a variety of purposes. For example, the metal binding ability may be used to stabilize ACNs from plant food sources, or to modify their colors for using them as food colorants. The complexation of metals with cyanidin derivatives can also be used as a simple, sensitive, cheap, and rapid method for determination concentrations of several metals in biological and environmental samples using UV-vis spectroscopy. Far less information is available on the ecological significance of ACN-metal complexes in plant-environment interactions. Metalloanthocyanins (protocyanin, nemophilin, commelinin, protodelphin, cyanosalvianin) are involved in the copigmentation phenomenon that leads to blue-pigmented petals, which may facilitate specific plant-pollinator interactions. ACN-metal formation and compartmentation into the vacuole has also been proposed to be part of an orchestrated detoxification mechanism in plants which experience metal/metalloid excess. However, investigations into ACN-metal interactions in plant biology may be limited because of the complexity of the analytical techniques required. To address this concern, here we describe simple methods for the detection of ACN-metal both in vitro and in vivo using UV-vis spectroscopy and colorimetric models. In particular, the use of UV-vis spectra, difference absorption spectra, and colorimetry techniques will be described for in vitro determination of ACN-metal features, whereas reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetric parameters related to CIE L*a*b* and CIE XYZ systems will be detailed for in vivo analyses. In this way, we hope to make this high-informative tool more accessible to plant physiologists and ecologists. ",2017
Local coexistence and genetic isolation of three pollinator species on the same fig tree species,,MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; WASP MUTUALISM; FICUS; HOST; WOLBACHIA; MTDNA; SPECIFICITY; PROGRAM,"Molecular tools increasingly reveal cryptic lineages and species that were previously unnoticed by traditional taxonomy. The discovery of cryptic species in sympatry prompts the question of how they coexist in the apparent absence of ecological divergence. However, this assumes first that the molecular taxonomy used to identify cryptic lineages delimits species boundaries accurately. This issue is important, because many diversity studies rely heavily or solely on data from mitochondrial DNA sequences for species delimitation, and several factors may lead to poor identification of species boundaries. We used a multilocus population genetics approach to show that three mtDNA-defined cryptic lineages of the fig wasp Pleistodontes imperialis Saunders, which pollinate Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubiginosa) in north-eastern Australia, represent reproductively isolated species. These species coexist locally, with about 13% of figs (where mating occurs) containing wasps from two or three species. However, there was no evidence for gene flow between them. Confirmed cases of coexisting cryptic species provide excellent opportunities for future studies of the ecological and evolutionary forces shaping both species coexistence and fig/pollinator coevolution.",2017
Increased fire frequency promotes stronger spatial genetic structure and natural selection at regional and local scales in Pinus halepensis Mill,Genetic diversity; spatial genetic structure; demographic history; natural selection; fire ecology,EASTERN IBERIAN PENINSULA; SEED BANK; POSTFIRE REGENERATION; MEDITERRANEAN BASIN; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; POPULATION; EVOLUTIONARY; CANOPY; FOREST; SHRUB,"Background and Aims The recurrence of wildfires is predicted to increase due to global climate change, resulting in severe impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Recurrent fires can drive plant adaptation and reduce genetic diversity; however, the underlying population genetic processes have not been studied in detail. In this study, the neutral and adaptive evolutionary effects of contrasting fire regimes were examined in the keystone tree species Pinus halepensis Mill. (Aleppo pine), a fire-adapted conifer. The genetic diversity, demographic history and spatial genetic structure were assessed at local (within-population) and regional scales for populations exposed to different crown fire frequencies. Methods Eight natural P. halepensis stands were sampled in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, five of them in a region exposed to frequent crown fires (HiFi) and three of them in an adjacent region with a low frequency of crown fires (LoFi). Samples were genotyped at nine neutral simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and at 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from coding regions, some of them potentially important for fire adaptation. Key Results Fire regime had no effects on genetic diversity or demographic history. Three high-differentiation outlier SNPs were identified between HiFi and LoFi stands, suggesting fire-related selection at the regional scale. At the local scale, fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) was overall weak as expected for a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed tree species. HiFi stands displayed a stronger SGS than LoFi stands at SNPs, which probably reflected the simultaneous post-fire recruitment of co-dispersed related seeds. SNPs with exceptionally strong SGS, a proxy for microenvironmental selection, were only reliably identified under the HiFi regime. Conclusions An increasing fire frequency as predicted due to global change can promote increased SGS with stronger family structures and alter natural selection in P. halepensis and in plants with similar life history traits.",2017

Environmental niche modeling of climatic factors has been instrumental in documenting the role of abiotic factors in a species' niche. Integrating this approach with data from species interactions provides a means to assess the relative roles of abiotic and biotic components. Here, we examine whether the high host specificity typically exhibited in the active pollination mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths is the result of differences in climatic niche requirements that limit yucca moth distributions or the result of competition among mutualistic moths that would co-occur on the same yucca species. We compared the species distribution models of two Tegeticula pollinator moths that use the geographically widespread plant Yucca filamentosa. Tegeticula yuccasella occurs throughout eastern North America whereas T. cassandra is restricted to the southeastern portion of the range, primarily occurring in Florida. Species distribution models demonstrate that T cassandra is restricted climatically to the southeastern United States and T. yuccasella is predicted to be able to live across all of eastern North America. Data on moth abundances in Florida demonstrate that both moth species are present on Y. filamentosa; however, T. cassandra is numerically dominant. Taken together, the results suggest that moth geographic distributions are heavily influenced by climate, but competition among pollinating congeners will act to restrict populations of moth species that co-occur.",2017

A previous phylogeographic study identified chloroplast DNA haplotype sharing between two vicariant tree species, one from forest (Hymenaea courbaril) and one from savanna (H. stigonocarpa) habitats. These species co-occur in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biome that encompasses forest patches and riverine forests within a savanna matrix. In order to investigate the evolutionary processes involved in the genetic divergence of these trees, we used nuclear microsatellite markers, statistical methods including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and leaf morphology to analyze neighboring and distant populations. Bayesian analysis revealed admixture between the species. ABC analysis supported the scenarios with the occurrence of gene flow between species during the Last Glacial Maximum or from the Holocene to the present, when compared to alternative scenarios of no gene flow or constant gene flow since divergence. However, putative hybrids did not exhibit intermediate leaflet morphology, which could be related to distinct selective pressures maintaining species integrity even in the face of gene flow. Our results suggest that despite morphological differences between savanna and forest species, interspecific barriers to gene flow might not be fully developed between vicariant tree species and that interspecific hybridization in trees from Cerrado biome may be an underdiagnosed process.",2017

Plants that produce floral traits preferred by particular pollinators are more likely to receive conspecific pollen and to evolve further adaptations to those pollinators that enhance pollination and ultimately generate floral diversity. Two mechanisms in particular, sensory bias and learning, are thought to explain how pollinator preference can contribute to divergence and speciation in flowering plants. While the preferences of pollinators, such as bees, flies, and birds, are frequently implicated in patterns of floral trait evolution, the role of learning in generating reproductive isolation and trait divergence for different floral types within plant populations is not well understood. Floral color polymorphism in particular provides an excellent opportunity to examine how pollinator behavior and learning might maintain the different floral morphs. In this study we asked if bumble bees showed innate preferences for different color morphs of the pollen-only plant Solanum tridynamum, whether bees formed preferences for the morphs with which they had experience collecting pollen from, and the strength of those learned preferences. Using an absolute conditioning protocol, we gave bees experience collecting pollen from a color polymorphic plant species that offered only pollen rewards. Despite initially-na < ve bees showing no apparent innate bias toward human-white versus human-purple flower morphs, we did find evidence of a bias in learning. Specifically, bees learned strong preferences for purple corollas, but learned only weak preferences for hypochromic (human-white) corollas. We discuss how our results might explain patterns of floral display evolution, particularly as they relate to color polymorphisms. Additionally, we propose that the ease with which floral visual traits are learned-i.e., biases in learning-can influence the evolution of floral color as a signal to pollinators.",2017

Flowers and fleshy fruits present various features that can attract animal mutualists through visual, olfactory, acoustic, and tactile cues and signals, and some of these traits may result from selection exerted by pollinators and seed dispersers. Plant attractants can provide information regarding the presence, location, and quality of the reward. However, because of the different functional outcomes of pollination and seed dispersal, pollination systems are thought to be more highly specialized than seed dispersal systems. Despite these interesting parallels and contrasts, theoretical and empirical insights in the sensory ecology of pollination and seed dispersal are rarely considered together. Here, we review extant theory and data of sensory attractants from both pollination and seed dispersal systems. We discuss theoretical and empirical similarities and differences between pollination and seed dispersal and offer suggestions for ways in which insights from each field may benefit the other in future.",2017

The effects of anthropogenic activities may lead to the genetic erosion of its genetic patrimony, which has high value for breeding programmes. In particular, the consequences of the introgression from cultivated stands are strongly dependent on the extent of gene flow and therefore this work aims at quantitatively describing contemporary gene flow patterns in wild olive natural populations. Methods The studied wild population is located in an undisturbed forest, in southern Spain, considered one of the few extant hotspots of true oleaster diversity. A total of 225 potential father trees and seeds issued from five mother trees were genotyped by eight microsatellite markers. Levels of contemporary pollen flow, in terms of both pollen immigration rates and within-population dynamics, were measured through paternity analyses. Moreover, the extent of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) was studied to assess the relative importance of seed and pollen dispersal in shaping the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Key Results The results showed that the population under study is characterized by a high genetic diversity, a relatively high pollen immigration rate (0.57), an average within-population pollen dispersal of about 107 m and weak but significant SGS up to 40 m. The population is a mosaic of several intermingled genetic clusters that is likely to be generated by spatially restricted seed dispersal. Moreover, wild oleasters were found to be self-incompatible and preferential mating between some genotypes was revealed. Conclusions Knowledge of the within-population genetic structure and gene flow dynamics will lead to identifying possible strategies aimed at limiting the effect of anthropogenic activities and improving breeding programmes for the conservation of olive tree forest genetic resources.",2017

They are ecologically important, however, as occasional outbreaks of the homotomid Mycopsylla fici may cause complete defoliation of its host plant, the Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla). Mycopsylla proxima, the only other species reported from Australia, feeds on F.rubiginosa without any recorded outbreaks. We searched for homotomids and their parasitoids on eight Ficus species on the east coast of Australia, Lord Howe Island (LHI), and in Auckland, New Zealand, and detected them on three Ficus species. Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, we delimited three Mycopsylla species, including a putative new species on F.watkinsiana. We also characterised six (including one previously described) parasitoid species of the genus Psyllaephagus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) based on congruent morphological characters and molecular data. Each of the homotomid species was highly host specific to a single fig species, whereas parasitoid species varied in host specificity: three host specific to M.fici and three host generalists. Geographic distribution varied among parasitoid species; e.g. one host-specific species was found on both the mainland and LHI, but a second species only on LHI. Our study revealed previously unrecognised diversity in fig homotomids and especially in their parasitoids. The herbivores and parasitoids showed contrasting patterns of host specificity. Interestingly, M.fici, the only outbreak species, had the highest diversity of associated parasitoid species and was the only species with host-specific parasitoids.",2017
Prediction of Arctic plant phenological sensitivity to climate change from historical records,Arctic; climate change; flowering time; herbarium specimen; Nunavut; seed dispersal time; temperature sensitivity,FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; HERBARIUM SPECIMENS; LIFE-HISTORY; RESPONSES; ALPINE; TUNDRA; TEMPERATURE; MORPHOLOGY; TRENDS; REVEAL,"The pace of climate change in the Arctic is dramatic, with temperatures rising at a rate double the global average. The timing of flowering and fruiting (phenology) is often temperature dependent and tends to advance as the climate warms. Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations can provide historical phenology records and have been used, on a localised scale, to predict species' phenological sensitivity to climate change. Conducting similar localised studies in the Canadian Arctic, however, poses a challenge where the collection of herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have been temporally and spatially sporadic. We used flowering and seed dispersal times of 23 Arctic species from herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across the 2.1million km(2) area of Nunavut, Canada, to determine (1) which monthly temperatures influence flowering and seed dispersal times; (2) species' phenological sensitivity to temperature; and (3) whether flowering or seed dispersal times have advanced over the past 120years. We tested this at different spatial scales and compared the sensitivity in different regions of Nunavut. Broadly speaking, this research serves as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology-climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales. Flowering times and seed dispersal time were most strongly correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively. Seed dispersal times have advanced at double the rate of flowering times over the past 120years, reflecting greater late-summer temperature rises in Nunavut. There is great diversity in the flowering time sensitivity to temperature of Arctic plant species, suggesting climate change implications for Arctic ecological communities, including altered community composition, competition, and pollinator interactions. Intraspecific temperature sensitivity and warming trends varied markedly across Nunavut and could result in greater changes in some parts of Nunavut than in others.",2017

These negative sentiments likely contribute to the disparity in wildlife conservation efforts, which largely favor vertebrate organisms. Bees represent one of the most ecologically and economically important invertebrate groups, yet bee diversity and abundance is declining worldwide, mirroring the general decline of invertebrate biodiversity. Developing and implementing successful conservation efforts requires interdisciplinary research that considers the ecological and social realities of today's world. To better inform conservation efforts related to bees, we examined adolescents' experiences and knowledge of, and attitudes toward, bees and investigated how these dimensions related to one another. A total of 794 eighth-grade science students from the suburbs of Chicago, USA completed a 48-item, paper questionnaire. The results indicated that adolescents were only somewhat knowledgeable about bee biology and services, and they confused bees with other flying insects, especially those with black-and-yellow coloration. Adolescents regarded bees with a generally neutral attitude; their knowledge and attitudes were correlated in a positive manner. Various bee-related experiences were linked to adolescents' knowledge and attitudes and may have influenced bee-related behavior. In particular, students who engaged in gardening and lawn-care activities demonstrated higher levels of knowledge and more positive attitudes.

Gypsum as a soil amendment to saline-sodic soils is widely used in agricultural fields to improve their soil physical, chemical and hence biological properties. This study aimed at analysing the effects of intensive WW irrigation on the structure and composition of soil-dwelling arthropods on spinach fields (Spinacia oleracea L.) in a West African urban vegetable production system. We used gypsum as a soil amendment with the potential to alleviate soil chemical stress resulting in a potentially positive impact on soil arthropods. A total of 32 plots were established that showed a gradient in soil pH ranging from slight to strong soil alkalinity and that were irrigated with WW (n = 12) or clean water (CW; n = 20), including eight plots into which gypsum was incorporated. Our study revealed a high tolerance of soil-dwelling arthropods for alkaline soils, but spinach fields with increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) showed a reduced abundance of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Auchenorrhyncha. Arthropod abundance was positively related to a dense spinach cover that in turn was not affected by WW irrigation or soil properties. Gypsum application reduced soil pH but increased soil EC. WW irrigation and related soil pH affected arthropod composition in the investigated spinach fields which may lead to negative effects on agronomical important arthropod groups such as pollinators and predators.

Seed Production Patterns in Zostera marina: Effects of Patch Size and Landscape Configuration,Eelgrass; Seagrass; Reproductive ecology; Pollen; Long Island,CHESAPEAKE BAY; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; SUBMARINE POLLINATION; GENETIC NEIGHBORHOOD; OUTCROSSING RATES; POLLEN LIMITATION; BANK VIABILITY; MATING SYSTEM; SEAGRASS BED; CRUSH TEST,"Zostera marina is a cosmopolitan, temperate seagrass species capable of both sexual and asexual (i.e., clonal) reproduction. Until recently, the importance of sexual reproduction has been largely dismissed, and clonal growth has dominated our understanding of space acquisition by Z. marina. This model of Z. marina growth was developed in locations where reproductive effort falls on the lower end of a wide range in sexual productivity. This study assessed Z. marina seed production as a function of patch size in a landscape where sexual reproduction has played a significant role in meadow expansion. Additionally, a landscape-scale analysis of seagrass proximity was performed to determine whether relationships between seed production and percent seagrass coverage exist. Reproductive shoots were collected from 58 seagrass patches of four different size classes: 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 m(2) over a two-year period. Seeds were harvested, enumerated, and scored for viability. Viable seed density was significantly related to patch size, but no statistically significant difference was found for non-viable seed densities between patch sizes. Larger patches, with both an edge and center region, were evaluated by region; no difference was found between seed production at the edge vs. center for these size classes. Finally, seed densities were not positively correlated with the amount of proximate seagrass in the landscape. The results of this study suggest that more explicit regional studies of sexual reproduction dynamics must be undertaken to fully understand the complex reproductive ecology of this angiosperm.",2017

However, the sexually dependent division of labor in clonal plants has received little attention, and few experimental tests have been conducted to date. Here, using reproductive ramets and non-reproductive ramets in the clonal plant Iris laevigata, we test this hypothesis on morphology and physiology through field and manipulative experiments, including an isotope (N-15) labeling method. With regard to morphology, under natural conditions, non-reproductive ramets of I. laevigata were more abundant, taller, and consisted exclusively of leaves, while the relatively rare, smaller reproductive ramets consisted of leaves, flowers, or seeds. However, the mean biomass of non-reproductive ramets was nearly half that of reproductive ramets. With regard to physiology, non-reproductive ramets had a significantly higher net photosynthetic rate over a 24-h period than reproductive ramets. Furthermore, the reproductive ramets stopped leaf growth when flower buds appeared in late May and lost photosynthetic capacity before late June, while its growing fruits still required a constant supply of many nutrients. Manipulative experiments showed that the non-reproductive ramets supplied the nutrient demands for reproduction of the reproductive ramets through clonal integration as high as delta N-15 of the value (196.1 +/- 73.39) of the seed. Thereby providing the first clear evidence of sexually dependent division of labor in clonal plants: Certain individuals constitute a very small amount of reproductive castes (reproductive ramets), whereas a large amount of other individuals (non-reproductive ramets) are""workers"" as in social insect societies whose role is primarily as producers. The rapid withering of reproductive ramets that failed to be pollinated highlights their role as irreversibly focused on reproduction, and those unable to reproduce do not contribute to the colony. Additionally,""producer"" ramets positively influenced reproductive castes growth, and the division of labor was assumed to underlie the resource allocation pattern among ramets.",2017
Influence of plant-pollinator interactions on the assembly of plant and hummingbird communities,community ecology; competition; facilitation; functional ecology; mutualism; ornithophily; phylogenetic structure; pollination,HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN RECEIPT; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; FLORAL SPECIALIZATION; FLOWERING COMMUNITIES; OTHERS POLLINATION; SHARED POLLINATORS; SPATIAL SCALES,"Understanding how ecological processes structure species assemblages is a central issue in community ecology. While the influence of plant-pollinator interactions on each other's evolution is well recognized, their role in the assembly of interdependent communities of plants and pollinators is still unclear. Using data from seven communities of hummingbirds and plants that they pollinate from two tropical rain forest types (lowland and montane), we evaluated phylogenetic relationships and signal of functional traits, over space and time, to test predictions on the main processes (environmental filtering, facilitation or competition) that are driving these hummingbird-plant assemblages. Our findings suggest that the main processes driving these assemblages varied between hummingbirds and plants and between habitats, and even among communities at the same habitat. The non-conserved floral trait and the phylogenetic patterns (even or random) give support to the hypothesis of facilitation or competition as processes regulating the composition of plant assemblages. Moreover, the positive relationship between fitness and flowering synchrony suggests facilitation as the most important mechanism for montane plant communities. Distinctively, for lowland plant communities, the combination of non-conserved traits and clustered phylogenetic patterns may be a result of either adaptive radiation or biotic filtering driven by a particular pollinator species that plays a main role as plant community organizer. Lastly, evidence of trait conservatism, together with clustered or even phylogenetic patterns, suggests that facilitation or competition may drive the assembly of montane hummingbird communities, despite the predominance of random phylogenetic patterns. Synthesis. Overall, we present a pathway to identify central ecological processes that may drive the assembly of plant-pollinator communities. We show that different processes related with pollination that vary in space and time may contribute to the assembly of the interdependent tropical communities of plants and pollinators. These findings highlight the importance of considering ecological interactions when evaluating community assembly processes.",2017
Human welfare and its connection to nature: What have we learned from crop pollination studies?,agriculture; biodiversity; conservation; food; interdisciplinary; values,WILD POLLINATORS; HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET; APIS-MELLIFERA; YIELD; CONSERVATION; SERVICES; ECOLOGY; TRENDS; AGRICULTURE,"Human welfare depends on the function of natural systems. This idea is paradigmatic to ecologists and has been the theme of a growing branch of applied ecology. I examine the narrative of human dependence on nature by considering the literature on crop pollination by animals and its importance for food production. Making the connections between human welfare and natural systems is seen as a way to better motivate society to make better decisions, but the debate around crop pollination has been surprisingly contentious. There have been confusing messages, disagreements on the facts, an unfortunate focus on dire projections for the future and a lesser focus on solutions. Most of these problems arise not from poor science but instead from poor communication of complex ideas and differences in perspective, such as the deep disciplinary gap between agricultural scientists and ecologists. By understanding these problems, we can improve the way we do our science and communicate our ideas. I argue that ecologists should continue to communicate the principle that human welfare depends on the function of natural systems and discuss how we can do so in a way that is more genuinely connected to society's needs, such as growing food. If we succeed, we will be changing an intellectually interesting conversation into a dialogue that influences how society interacts with nature.",2017
Cryptic diversity in a fig wasp community-morphologically differentiated species are sympatric but cryptic species are parapatric,alpha diversity; beta diversity; community assembly; cryptic species; fig wasps; neutral theory; niche theory,ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; DNA BARCODES; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POLLINATING WASP; MUTUALISM; EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; HOST; PATTERNS,"A key debate in ecology centres on the relative importance of niche and neutral processes in determining patterns of community assembly with particular focus on whether ecologically similar species with similar functional traits are able to coexist. Meanwhile, molecular studies are increasingly revealing morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species with presumably similar ecological roles. Determining the geographic distribution of such cryptic species provides opportunities to contrast predictions of niche vs. neutral models. Discovery of sympatric cryptic species increases alpha diversity and supports neutral models, while documentation of allopatric/parapatric cryptic species increases beta diversity and supports niche models. We tested these predictions using morphological and molecular data, coupled with environmental niche modelling analyses, of a fig wasp community along its 2700-km latitudinal range. Molecular methods increased previous species diversity estimates from eight to eleven species, revealing morphologically cryptic species in each of the four wasp genera studied. Congeneric species pairs that were differentiated by a key morphological functional trait (ovipositor length) coexisted sympatrically over large areas. In contrast, morphologically similar species, with similar ovipositor lengths, typically showed parapatric ranges with very little overlap. Despite parapatric ranges, environmental niche models of cryptic congeneric pairs indicate large regions of potential sympatry, suggesting that competitive processes are important in determining the distributions of ecologically similar species. Niche processes appear to structure this insect community, and cryptic diversity may typically contribute mostly to beta rather than alpha diversity.",2017
A new Cheirolepidiaceae (Coniferales) from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia (Argentina): Reconciling the records of impression and permineralized fossils,conifer; paleobotany; Pararaucaria; seed cone,SEED CONES; SP-NOV; POLLINATION; ANTARCTICA; EVOLUTION; POLLEN; ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY; MICROTOMOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants preserved in different fossil modes provide complementary data concerning the paleobiology and evolutionary relationships among plant groups. New material from the Early Jurassic of Patagonia shows the importance of combining these sources of information, as we describe the first compression/ impression fossils of Pararaucaria, a genus of the extinct conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae previously known from permineralized fossils. These fossils extend the temporal range of this genus and may allow its wider recognition in the fossil record. METHODS: We studied fossil plants from the Early Jurassic (Pleinsbachian-Toarcian) locality of Taquetren in Patagonia, Argentina using standard paleobotanical preparation and description techniques. KEY RESULTS: Pararaucaria taquetrensis consists of isolated ovuliferous scales and small seed cones with helically arranged bract-scale complexes attached to scale-leaf foliage. Bract-scale complexes consist of separated bracts and ovuliferous scales with two seeds and three broad distal lobes. CONCLUSIONS: Pararaucaria taquetrensis represents the oldest known Cheirolepidiaceae seed cones from the Southern Hemisphere, and this material highlights the importance of compression and impression fossils in understanding the distribution of fossil taxa. This material also suggests that Cheirolepidiaceae cone scales can be easily confused with those of another common conifer family, the Araucariaceae, which has important implications for accurately understanding Mesozoic conifer diversity and paleoecology.",2017

A new synthetic polyploid induced by hybridization with unreduced gametes and heterozygotic embryo chromosome doubling can effectively combine polyploidy and heterosis, which can provide two major breeding advantages. In Populus, successfully creating and cultivating new polyploid varieties have economic and ecological production value. This was the first successful study in which embryo sac and zygotic embryo chromosome doubling was induced using high temperatures to produce triploids and tetraploids in Populus simonii Carr. and its hybrid, P. simonii x P. nigra var. Italica, of Populus sect. Tacamahaca. The relationship between flower bud morphological characteristics (time after pollination) and female meiotic stage (embryo sac and zygotic embryo development) was established to guide the induction treatment period. In the resulting progeny, 37 triploids and 12 tetraploids were obtained and identified using flow cytometry. The optimal temperatures for embryo sac and zygotic embryo chromosome doubling were 38 and 41 A degrees C, respectively. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that 66-72 h after pollination (HAP), a period characterized by a high proportion of one-nucleate and two-nucleate embryo sacs, was the optimal period for embryo sac chromosome doubling. For zygotic embryo chromosome doubling, 168 HAP was the optimal induction period, as there was a high proportion of two-cell and four-cell proembryos. The results indicate that inducing embryo sac and zygotic embryo chromosome doubling is an ideal method for producing polyploids. The methods for inducing polyploids and for evaluating ploidy and offspring with different ploidies and heterozygosity in this study will be useful for genetic research and Populus breeding programmes.",2017
Does population distribution matter? Influence of a patchy versus continuous distribution on genetic patterns in a wind-pollinated shrub,Allocasuarina humilis; chloroplast; haplotype; microsatellite; phylogeography; south-western Australia; spatial distribution; SWAFR,LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; CHLOROPLAST GENOME; PLANT-POPULATIONS; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; NULL ALLELES; DIVERSITY,"AimUniform spatial population distributions are predicted to result in lower among-population genetic differentiation and higher within-population genetic diversity than naturally patchy distributions, but there have been surprisingly few attempts to isolate this effect from confounding factors. We studied the widespread wind-pollinated shrub Allocasuarina humilis that is common in a geologically stable landscape characterized by long-term population persistence to test the influence of semi-continuous versus patchy population distributions on genetic patterns. We also investigated whether A. humilis shows the high population connectedness and genetic diversity typically associated with wind pollination, a relatively uncommon and little-studied syndrome in this landscape. LocationHeath-shrublands (heath') and forests of south-western Australia. methods populations were sampled from heath and forest regions, which respectively exhibited semi-continuous and patchy population distributions. Genetic structure and diversity were assessed for 27 populations using eight nuclear microsatellite markers and three chloroplast regions. Phylogeographical history was examined using Bayesian phylogeny reconstruction, parsimony analysis and tests of expansion. results high haplotype diversity is consistent with long-term population persistence across most of the species' range. Nuclear markers showed low overall population differentiation and no geographical structure over c.900km, reflecting extensive pollen dispersal. For both marker types, patchily distributed forest populations were substantially more differentiated with significantly lower within-population diversity than semi-continuous heath populations. Phylogeographical analysis revealed evidence for earlier colonization of heath than forest and recent expansion into wetter forests, consistent with progressive long-term climatic drying. Main conclusions high population connectedness and genetic diversity probably resulted from wind pollination in combination with dioecy and long life span. Patchy population distributions appear to have influenced genetic structure and diversity through lower pollen and seed dispersal, lower effective population sizes and greater genetic drift. Our approach illustrates the value of minimizing confounding variables by testing the effect of a variable ecological trait within a single species.",2017

Work conducted at Zackenberg, Northeast Greenland, has changed our view on how networks of arctic biotic interactions are structured, how they vary in time, and how they are changing with current environmental change: firstly, the high arctic interaction webs are much more complex than previously envisaged, and with a structure mainly dictated by its arthropod component. Secondly, the dynamics of species within these webs reflect changes in environmental conditions. Thirdly, biotic interactions within a trophic level may affect other trophic levels, in some cases ultimately affecting land-atmosphere feedbacks. Finally, differential responses to environmental change may decouple interacting species.

Infestation results in reduced moisture availability for winter cereal crops as well as reduced crop yields and pasture quality. The need to manage this weed is of paramount importance given its adverse effects on farming systems, biodiversity and grazing livestock and its ranking as the number one weed of importance in Australian summer fallows of grain crops. Land management practices, including movement of grazing animals and over-stocking, are potentially assisting the spread of Cucumis myriocarpus fruits and viable seed. The plant is characterized by the presence of small, ellipsoid to spherical melon fruits with spiny appendages. Each plant can produce up to 50 or more melons per plant, with each fruit containing up to 200 viable seeds. Seed is often dormant upon fruit maturity and our results under controlled environmental conditions suggest both physiological and physical factors influence dormancy. Under field conditions, seedlings can form large vines growing upto 3 m in length. Field pollination experiments suggest that this melon is mainly self-pollinated by insects, including bees, flies and wasps. Cucumis myriocarpus is generally managed by the use of various broadleaf phenoxy herbicides and systemic post-emergent products. It is found in this study that this weed established through multiple flushes of germination, hence multiple herbicidal applications coinciding with rainfall events one suggested for more efficacious management. However, rotation of infested pastures with cereal crops such as canola and wheat also results in improved control. Additional studies into the impact of soil with and physical properties, disturbance and grazing, are recommended for development of more efficacious control measures. This review discusses taxonomy, genetic variation, biology and ecology and management of this important summer annual weed.  ",2017
Potential pollination maintenance by an exotic allodapine bee under climate change scenarios in the Indo-Pacific region,Australia; climate change; distribution models; exotic bee; New Zealand; Pacific Islands,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; CONSERVATION BIOGEOGRAPHY; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; PLANT INVASIONS; OCEANIC ISLANDS; HABITAT MODELS; UNITED-STATES; NICHE MODELS,"Recent studies suggest an alarming decline in pollinators across many regions of the world due to multiple factors. One potential factor is climate change, which poses both direct and indirect threats to pollinator populations. To help ameliorate the impact of declining populations on the function of ecological and agricultural systems, there is a need to identify species that may adapt to limit the magnitude of this pollination deficit. The South West Pacific has a highly depauperate endemic bee diversity and numerous non-indigenous species, including honeybees. One allodapine bee, Braunsapis puangensis, has been accidentally introduced to Fiji where it has rapidly spread across multiple islands and become locally abundant. It is a long-tongued bee, unaffected by honeybee pathogens, and has the potential to become an important crop pollinator. Here, we model the distribution of this species under different climate scenarios to determine how it is likely to respond to future climate change. We show that its distribution is unlikely to contract, but potentially expand with climate warming. These scenarios therefore indicate that the plasticity in B.puangensis populations may allow it to represent an important crop pollinator in this region should honeybee populations decline.",2017

Landscape liveability spatial assessment integrating ecosystem and urban services with their perceived importance by stakeholders,Ecosystem services mapping; Urban services; Liveability mapping; Service accessibility; Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis; Landscape planning; Open street map,MULTICRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS; RURAL-NATURAL GRADIENT; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DEMAND; MANAGEMENT; GIS; SUSTAINABILITY; POLLINATION; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY,"In recent years, landscape liveability has become a leading objective in policy and strategic planning. In the anthropocentric view of landscape, ecosystems fulfil important societal needs similarly to urban systems. Urban systems can meet a variety of such needs through Urban Services, which are historically and typically provided within cities. In this view, Ecosystem Services (ES) and Urban Services (US) influence landscape liveability in a comparable manner, so that liveability assessments based on both ES and US can be effective for landscape planning and policy-making purposes. As liveability is strongly dependent not only on objective landscape features, but also on the subjective perception of stakeholders, their involvement becomes essential for a coherent liveability assessment. The present study aims to develop a Liveability Spatial Assessment Model (LISAM) capable of considering both the local accessibility of services and their perceived relevance as expressed by stakeholders. To this end, a conceptual framework to detangle the spatial relationships between service sources, sinks, and delivery points was developed. From this base, consistent and comparable ES and US indices were calculated using GIS spatialisation techniques and then aggregated hierarchically through a Spatial Multicriteria Decision Making Analysis approach. Results include relevant maps showing explicit spatial indices of liveability that integrate, at various hierarchical levels, the local accessibility of ES and US, along with their local perceived relevance. By calculating complex indices able to highlight both the agri-natural and urban system roles on landscape liveability and by taking subjective and objective aspects into account, the model proved to be effective for spatial decision-making. In future applications, indicator and weight uncertainties should be considered and adequately analysed to assess reliability of the final output. The integration of ecosystem and urban disservices would also be relevant for including those landscape factors that reduce the overall level of place liveability.  ",2017
Rodents and baboons reduce seed cone production of Protea neriifolia,Florivory; Proteaceae; Protea neriifolia; Rodent pollination; Baboon; Fynbos,SOUTH-AFRICA; POLLINATION; HERBIVORY; ECOLOGY,"Rodents are important pollinators and seed predators of fynbos Proteaceae, but their role as florivores has received little attention. Chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) are known to feed on Proteaceae inflorescences, however, their effect on plant reproduction has not been quantified. We recorded the extent of damage by rodents and baboons to inflorescences of the dominant shrub, Protea neriifolia, in 20 x 20 m plots in the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve near Stellenbosch. Damage was distributed patchily across the landscape. Rodents damaged up to 23% of the inflorescences per plot by feeding on styles and nectar. We observed the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) climbing up plants to feed on inflorescences. Up to 14% of inflorescences in some plots were destroyed by rodents gnawing through inflorescence stems. Baboons damaged or destroyed 12% to 29% of inflorescences at three study sites, but did not forage at all in the three remaining study sites. Among plant individuals affected by baboons or rodents, a mean proportion of 0.49 +/- 0.31 (SD) of individuals' inflorescences were damaged or destroyed. Florivory by rodents and baboons can thus reduce the fecundity of P. neriifolia significantly. Protea inflorescences may be an important seasonal food source for certain rodents. In an evolutionary context, rodent florivory may have been an important selective force that caused certain Proteaceae species to shift to rodent pollination. Further work is needed to determine which rodent species feed on Protea inflorescences and whether rodent florivory is widespread in fynbos.",2017
Predicting acute contact toxicity of pesticides in honeybees (Apis mellifera) through a k-nearest neighbor model,Pesticides; Honey bees; k-NN; In silico models; Acute contact toxicity,BEE; SUSCEPTIBILITY,"Ecological risk assessment of plant protection products (PPPs) requires an understanding of both the toxicity and the extent of exposure to assess risks for a range of taxa of ecological importance including target and non-target species. Non-target species such as honey bees (Apis mellifera), solitary bees and bumble bees are of utmost importance because of their vital ecological services as pollinators of wild plants and crops. To improve risk assessment of PPPs in bee species, computational models predicting the acute and chronic toxicity of a range of PPPs and contaminants can play a major role in providing structural and physico-chemical properties for the prioritisation of compounds of concern and future risk assessments; Over the last three decades, scientific advisory bodies and the research community have developed toxicological databases and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that are proving invaluable to predict toxicity using historical data and reduce animal testing. This paper describes the development and validation of a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model using in-house software for the prediction of acute contact toxicity of pesticides on honey bees. Acute contact toxicity data were collected from different sources for 256 pesticides, which were divided into training and test sets. The k-NN models were validated with good prediction, with an accuracy of 70% for all compounds and of 65% for highly toxic compounds, suggesting that they might reliably predict the toxicity of structurally diverse pesticides and could be used to screen and prioritise new pesticides.

Insect pollinators play an essential functional role in terrestrial ecosystems, supporting ecological stability and food security worldwide. Therefore, assessing impact on pollinators is fundamental in any effort aiming at enhancing the environmental sustainability of human production and consumption, especially in the agri-food supply chains. Different drivers are leading to pollinator populations' declines. Improving a supply-chain oriented assessment of the occurrence of pressure and impacts on pollinators is needed. However, current methodologies assessing impact along supply chains, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), miss to assess impact on pollinators. In fact, none of the existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models effectively accounts for pollinators. Some LCIA models have mentioned pollination, but none has presented key drivers of impact and a proposal for integrating pollinators as target group for biodiversity protection within an LCIA framework. In order to devise a pathway towards the inclusion of impacts on pollinators in LCIA, we conducted a literature review of environmental and anthropogenic pressures acting on insect pollinators, potentially threatening pollination services. Based on the evidence in literature, we identified and described eight potential impact drivers, primarily deriving from industrial development and intensive agricultural practice: 1) intensified land use as a result of uncontrolled expansion of urban areas and modern agricultural practices; 2) use of pesticides; 3) presence of invasive alien plants; 4) competition with invasive alien pollinator species; 5) global and local climate change; 6) spread of pests and pathogens; 7) electro-magnetic pollution and 8) genetically modified crops. To account for these drivers in LCIA, there are specific modeling needs. Hence, the current study provides recommendation on how future research should be oriented to improve the current models and how novel indicators should be developed in order to cover the existing conceptual and methodological gaps.

Population-level genetic variation and climate change in a biodiversity hotspot,California; genetic diversity; climate change; Klamath Siskiyou; Coast Ranges; Central Valley; refugia; alpine habitat,CALIFORNIA FLORISTIC PROVINCE; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; INTRASPECIFIC PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; RANGE SHIFTS; CONTRASTING PATTERNS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; PINUS-BALFOURIANA,"Introduction Estimated future climate scenarios can be used to predict where hotspots of endemism may occur over the next century, but life history, ecological and genetic traits will be important in informing the varying responses within myriad taxa. Essential to predicting the consequences of climate change to individual species will be an understanding of the factors that drive genetic structure within and among populations. Here, I review the factors that influence the genetic structure of plant species in California, but are applicable elsewhere; existing levels of genetic variation, life history and ecological characteristics will affect the ability of an individual taxon to persist in the presence of anthropogenic change. Factors influencing the distribution of genetic variation Persistence in the face of climate change is likely determined by life history characteristics: dispersal ability, generation time, reproductive ability, degree of habitat specialization, plant-insect interactions, existing genetic diversity and availability of habitat or migration corridors. Existing levels of genetic diversity in plant populations vary based on a number of evolutionary scenarios that include endemism, expansion since the last glacial maximum, breeding system and current range sizes. Regional priorities and examples A number of well-documented examples are provided from the California Floristic Province. Some predictions can be made for the responses of plant taxa to rapid environmental changes based on geographic position, evolutionary history, existing genetic variation, and ecological amplitude. Conclusions, Solutions and Recommendations The prediction of how species will respond to climate change will require a synthesis drawing from population genetics, geography, palaeontology and ecology. The important integration of the historical factors that have shaped the distribution and existing genetic structure of California's plant taxa will enable us to predict and prioritize the conservation of species and areas most likely to be impacted by rapid climate change, human disturbance and invasive species.",2017
Seed predation of Copaifera langsdorffii (Fabaceae): a tropical tree with supra-annual fruiting,plant phenology; predator satiation hypothesis; resource concentration; Rhinochenus brevicollis; seed size,TEMPORAL VARIATION; SATIATION HYPOTHESIS; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; CERRADO FRAGMENT; SIZE; DISPERSAL; PLANT; CAESALPINIOIDEAE; CONSEQUENCES; POLLINATORS,"Seed predation is an important ecological and evolutionary force that directly affects the distribution of plant species. Copaifera langsdorffii is a tropical tree species with supra-annual fruiting, which has its seeds predated by a specialist endogenous insect (Rynochenus brevicollis: Curculionidae) in the Brazilian savanna. Three hypotheses were addressed: (i) the predator satiation hypothesis, (ii) the resource concentration hypothesis and (iii) the larger seed predation hypothesis. A total of 112 individual C. langsdorffii were monitored monthly from January to August during four consecutive years (from 2008 to 2011) to determine the presence of fruits on each plant. All trees produced fruits in the year 2008, whereas none of them produced flowers or fruits in 2009 or 2010. Moreover, only 65 individuals (58%) marked in 2008 produced fruits in 2011. The number of fruits per plant was approximately 21% greater in 2008 than in 2011, while the percentage of seed predation was 76% greater in 2011, thereby supporting the predator satiation hypothesis. The percentage of seeds predated was not affected by the number of fruits per plant. Therefore, our data did not support the resource concentration hypothesis. Plants producing large seeds experienced more seed predation by R. brevicollis, supporting the larger seed predation hypothesis. In addition, we also observed a positive relationship between seed volume and adult R. brevicollis weight. This study demonstrates the importance of supra-annual fruiting for increasing survivorship of C. langsdorffii seeds both at the individual and the population level, and suggests that seed predators select plants producing large seeds as a way of increasing the number of offspring.",2017
Effects of hummingbird morphology on specialization in pollination networks vary with resource availability,,PLANT; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION; FOREST; BIRDS; ANDES; SHAPE,"Specialization of species in interaction networks influences network stability and ecosystem functioning. Spatial and temporal variation in resource availability may provide insight into how ecological factors, such as resource abundance, and evolutionary factors, such as phylogenetically conserved morphological traits, influence specialization within mutualistic networks. We used independent measures of hummingbird abundance and resources (nectar), information on hummingbird traits and plant-hummingbird interactions to examine how resource availability and species' morphology influence the specialization of hummingbirds in three habitat types (forest, shrubs, cattle ranch) sampled over 10 sessions across two years in the southern Andes of Ecuador. Specialization of hummingbird species in the networks was measured by three indices: d' (related to niche partitioning), generality (related to niche width) and PSI (related to pollination services). Specialization indices d', generality and PSI of hummingbird species were influenced by resource availability. All indices indicated that specialization of hummingbirds increased when the availability of resources decreased. Variation in d' was also explained by an interaction between resource availability and bill length; hummingbirds with a long bill switched from being more specialized than other species when resource availability was low to being similarly specialized when availability was high. Overall, our results highlight the importance of ecological and evolutionary factors determining the specialization of species in interaction networks. We demonstrate in particular that ecological gradients in resource availability cause substantial changes in consumers' foraging behavior contingent on their morphology. Changes in pollinator specialization along resource gradients can have impacts on ecosystem functions, such as pollination by animals.",2017
The Silent Beehive: How the Decline of Honey Bee Populations Shifted the Environmental Protection Agency's Pesticide Policy towards Pollinators,,,"When honey bee populations began to drastically decline in 2006 from what came to be known as Colony Collapse Disorder, the response from the United States Department of Agriculture was swift. As research emerged on the causes, pesticides specifically a new and widely used class of pesticides called neonicotinoids quickly emerged as an identifiable culprit. In reaction, the Environmental Protection Agency, as the administrator of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, began to develop a new, tiered ecological risk assessment framework to better analyze the risk that pesticides posed to honey bees and other insect pollinators. In 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency applied the new guidelines to the application for registration of a new type of neonicotinoid, sulfoxaflor. However, despite the analysis showing that sulfoxaflor posed high risks to honey bees, the Environmental Protection Agency approved the unconditional registration of sulfoxaflor. Pollinator advocates then successfully challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's registration of the neonicotinoid pesticide, sulfoxaflor in Pollinator Stewardship Council v. EPA. This was a victory for pollinator advocates who had been unsuccessful in challenging other pesticide registrations due to the lengthy administrative petition required. This Note argues that it was the combination of honey bees' critical importance in the agricultural industry and their prevalence in popular culture that drove the quick agency action that led to the Environmental Protection Agency's creation of the Pollinator Risk Assessment guidelines. These new guidelines included set standards that allowed pollinator advocates to successfully challenge a registration. However, even though the Pollinator Risk Assessment guidelines have resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency applying higher scrutiny to neonicotinoids, the ability of the new guidelines to significantly impact pesticide policy is and will continue to be limited, even while honey bees continue to garner attention in popular culture.",2017
Phenological evidence from China to address rapid shifts in global flowering times with recent climate change,Flowering time; Phenological shift; Climate change; Meta-analysis; China,SPRING PHENOLOGY; PLANTS; RESPONSES; IMPACTS,"Climate-related flowering phenology has attracted increasing concerns due to its irreplaceable contribution to innovative theory and application of plant phenology at global scale. Most of previous long-term observations were focused on interannual variations in flowering time in Europe and North America, however, very few of them in China were so far reported. Here, we present a meta-analysis through compiling the extended data set from 62 ground-based observations including 136 plant species from 217 observational sites across 8 climatic zones from 1963 to 2013 in China. Quantitative trends in 649 time series (1963-2013) of flowering phases and corresponding temperature changes were analyzed. The results indicated that the beginning, peak and ending of flowering were generally advanced by 2.2, 2.3 and 1.4 days decade(-1), respectively, as a result of temperature increase. Flowering duration tended to be prolonged, mainly due to higher temperature sensitivity and greater advancement in the beginning of flowering rather than the ending of flowering. Particularly, the most pronounced advancement in flowering time was observed in east China, up to 3.6 days decade(-1) as a result of contemporaneous warming. Specifically, flowering time of herbaceous plants displayed an advancing trend by 0.7 day decade(-1) per degree of increasing latitude. Furthermore, early-flowering speciestended to flower earlier than late-flowering ones did. Wind-pollinated and herb species showed greater phonological advancement and temperature sensitivity than insect-pollinated species and other growth forms did. Our results were to some extent different from those in Europe and North America, but played a critical and complementary role at global scale. Our findings and database presented should be powerful complements to address climate-associated flowering shifts and their ecological impacts at global scale.",2017
"The bee, the flower, and the electric field: electric ecology and aerial electroreception",Bees; Plants; Electric fields; Pollen; Mechanoreception,ELECTROSTATIC FORCES; POLLINATION; BUMBLEBEES; POLLEN; EVOLUTION; INSECTS; SIGNALS; NECTAR; SCENT; CUE,"Bees and flowering plants have a long-standing and remarkable co-evolutionary history. Flowers and bees evolved traits that enable pollination, a process that is as important to plants as it is for pollinating insects. From the sensory ecological viewpoint, bee-flower interactions rely on senses such as vision, olfaction, humidity sensing, and touch. Recently, another sensory modality has been unveiled; the detection of the weak electrostatic field that arises between a flower and a bee. Here, we present our latest understanding of how these electric interactions arise and how they contribute to pollination and electroreception. Finite-element modelling and experimental evidence offer new insights into how these interactions are organised and how they can be further studied. Focussing on pollen transfer, we deconstruct some of the salient features of the three ingredients that enable electrostatic interactions, namely the atmospheric electric field, the capacity of bees to accumulate positive charge, and the propensity of plants to be relatively negatively charged. This article also aims at highlighting areas in need of further investigation, where more research is required to better understand the mechanisms of electrostatic interactions and aerial electroreception.",2017
Cophylogenetic signal is detectable in pollination interactions across ecological scales,compartmentalization; co-speciation; modularity; mutualism; mutualistic networks; phylogenetic structure; pollination syndromes,PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; BIPARTITE NETWORKS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; FIG WASPS; MODULARITY; PLANT; COEVOLUTION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS,"That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction, extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: (1) across plant-pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4) in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant-pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when within-module phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator-angiosperm interactions.",2017
Phylogenetic trends in the evolution of inflorescence odours in Amorphophallus,Araceae; Amorphophallus; Odours; Headspace analysis,INTRON SEQUENCES; CARRION BEETLES; FIELD RESPONSE; FLORAL ODORS; RAIN-FOREST; 2ND INTRON; ARACEAE; TITANUM; POLLINATION; ACID,"The chemical composition of inflorescence odours of 80 species of Amorphophallus (Araceae) were determined by headspace-thermal desorption GC-MS. When compared to published molecular phylogenies of the genus, the data reveal evidence both of phylogenetic constraint and plasticity of odours. Dimethyl oligosulphides were found as common constituents of Amorphophallus odours and were the most abundant components in almost half of the species studied. Odours composed mainly of dimethyl oligosulphides, and perceived as being 'gaseous', were only found among Asian species, and some of these species clustered in certain clades in molecular phylogenies; e.g. in two clades in Amorphophallus subgenus Metandrium. However, some species with gaseous odours were found to be closely related to species producing odours more reminiscent of rotting meat in which various minor components accompany the dominant dimethyl oligosulphides. These two broad types of odours have co-evolved with other inflorescence characteristics such as colour, with species with rotting meat odours having darker inflorescences. Species producing pleasant odours characterised by benzenoid compounds constitute two broad groups that are not related in published phylogenies. Species having fruity odours containing 1-phenylethanol derivatives mainly occur in a Glade in subgenus Metandrium while those with anise odours composed almost solely of the 2-phenylethanol derivative 4-methoxyphenethyl alcohol are restricted to a Glade in subgenus Scutandrium. Phylogenetic mapping of odours also indicates that the evolution of some odour types is likely to have been influenced by ecological factors. For example, species producing fishy odours dominated by trimethylamine and occurring in N and NE Borneo are not all closely related. Conversely, two sister species, A. mossambicensis and A. abyssinicus, which are morphologically very similar and have overlapping geographical distribution, produce odours which are very different chemically. The pressure of pollinator resource has therefore been a factor influencing the evolution of odours in Amorphophallus, driving both the divergence of odour types in some taxa and the convergence of odour types in others.

Campylomma chinensis Schuh (Hemiptera: Miridae) is an omnivorous predator that feeds on both small soft-bodied arthropods and plant hosts including purple trailing lantana Lantana montevidensis (Spreng.) Briq. (Lamiales: Verbenaceae). In laboratory experiments, we examined the effect of fresh inflorescences and volatiles of L. montevidensis on the behavior of adult C. chinensis. In a Y-tube olfactometer, we found that the fresh inflorescences of L. montevidensis significantly attracted adult C. chinensis. Then, the volatile compounds from the fresh inflorescences of L. montevidensis were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that there were seventeen compounds detected in the inflorescences, and the main components were terpenoids including monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids. Moreover, the adults were significantly attracted to the concentration of 5 A mu l/ml farnesol. The results of the present work implied that the omnivorous mirid C. chinensis used farnesol, a sesquiterpenoid alcohol derivative, to identify and locate its plant hosts. The role of farnesol as a potential synomone for C. chinensis is discussed.",2017
"Pollination of the cycad Zamia incognita A.

One of the most important considerations for the effective conservation of Zamia is its highly specialized reproductive biology. Despite the importance of pollination for the populations' viability, no studies have examined the pollination process of cycads in Colombia. Herein, we describe the pollination process of Zamia incognita A. Lindstr. & Idarraga, in a natural population. Exclusion experiments were performed by selectively excluding wind, beetles, both, or neither, which demonstrated that Pharaxonotha beetles are effective pollinators of Zamia incognita and that wind does not play any role as pollen vector. By following beetles marked with fluorescent dyes and directly observing beetle movements on and into female cones and micropyles, we confirmed that Pharaxonotha sp. is the effective pollinator of Z. incognita. The beetles traveled a maximum dispersal distance from a male to female cone of nearly 22 m and a minimum distance of 5 m. We found Pharaxonotha beetles in male cones, where they complete their life cycle. Cones produce heat in a circadian pattern associated with the elongation of the cones and pollen shedding. The increase in cones' temperature appears to play an important role in beetle attraction. We suggest that pollination droplets on the micropyles would be a reward to pollinators. We also discuss the relationship of this Zamia species with other insects, which have important consequences for the conservation of web interactions.",2017
Pesticides and bees: Ecological-economic modelling of bee populations on farmland,Pollination; Pesticides; Wild bees; Commercial bees; Ecological-economic modelling,CROP POLLINATION SERVICES; HONEY-BEES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE; BIODIVERSITY; AGROECOSYSTEMS; CONSERVATION; INSURANCE; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE,"Production of insect-pollinated crops typically relies on both pesticide use and pollination, leading to a potential conflict between these two inputs. In this paper we combine ecological modelling with economic analysis to investigate the effects of pesticide use on wild and commercial bees, whilst allowing farmers to partly offset the negative effects of pesticides on bee populations by creating more on-farm bee habitat. Farmers have incentives to invest in creating wild bee habitat to increase pollination inputs due to the contribution this makes to yields. However, the optimal allocation of on-farm habitat strongly depends on the negative effects of pesticides, with a threshold-like behaviour at a critical level of the impairment. When this threshold is crossed, the population of wild bees becomes locally extinct and their availability to pollinate breaks down. We show that availability of commercial bees masks this decrease in pollination services which would otherwise incentivise farmers to conserve the wild pollinator population. Indeed, if commercial bees are available, optimum profit may be achieved by providing no habitat at all for wild bees, and allowing these wild pollinators to go extinct.",2017
Landscape Scale Study of the Net Effect of Proximity to a Neonicotinoid-Treated Crop on Bee Colony Health,,OILSEED RAPE; HONEY-BEES; POLLINATING INSECTS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; WILD BEES; PESTICIDE; MASS; IMPACT; GROWTH,"Since 2013, the European Commission has restricted the use of three neonicotinoid insecticides as seed dressings on bee-attractive crops. Such crops represent an important source of forage for bees, which is often scarce in agro-ecosystems. However, this benefit has often been overlooked in the design of previous field studies, leaving the net impact of neonicotinoid treated crops on bees relatively unknown. Here, we determine the combined benefit (forage) and cost (insecticide) of oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds on Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera colonies. In April 2014, 36 colonies per species were located adjacent to three large oilseed rape fields (12 colonies per field). Another 36 were in three nearby locations in the same agro-ecosystem, but several kilometers distant from any oilseed rape fields. We found that Bombus colony growth and reproduction were unaffected by location (distant versus adjacent) following the two month flowering period. Apis colony and queen survival were unaffected. However, there was a small, but significant, negative relationship between honey and pollen neonicotinoid contamination and Apis colony weight gain. We hypothesize that any sublethal effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on Bombus colonies are potentially offset by the additional foraging resources provided. A better understanding of the ecological and agronomic factors underlying neonicotinoid residues is needed to inform evidence-based policy.",2017
Masting has different effects on seed predation by insects and birds in antarctic beech forests with no influence of forest management,Bird predation; Insect predation; Masting; Nothofagus; Predator satiation; Seed production,SOUTHERN PATAGONIAN FORESTS; VARIABLE RETENTION; NOTHOFAGUS-ANTARCTICA; SILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PULSED RESOURCES; WIND POLLINATION; ACORN PREDATION; FAGUS-CRENATA; OAK FORESTS,"Mast seeding is characteristic of many long-lived tree species and widely proposed as a mechanism to reduce seed predation. However, whether the efficiency of this reproductive response may vary depending on type of seed predator (e.g., invertebrates vs. vertebrates) or depending on local characteristics, remains seldom explored. We evaluated for 8 yrs the patterns of seed production in antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica) forests related to management and its influence on insect and bird pre dispersal seed predation. Along the study, mature seed production was highly variable across years (the population-level coefficient of variation, CVp: 0.98-1.14) and spatially synchronized (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.83-0.86). Forest type (primary unmanaged, secondary-growth and managed stands) did not influence the amount of seed production nor masting patterns. Mean yearly seed predation by insects was higher than by birds, and their relationship with seeding patterns differed: i.e., while the proportion of seeds predated by insects increased during non-mast years maximum bird predation occurred in mast years. Therefore, predation by insects and birds showed a strong negative relationship. Our results suggest that effectiveness of masting to escape seed predators may be highly depend on the type of predator. We address whether this effect may be due to differences in life history traits among the seed predators involved (i.e., degree of host specificity, dispersal ability or the duration of the life-cycle) and whether an ""imperfect"" control of avian seed predation may partially be advantageous for the dynamics of the masting species to enhance seed dispersal.",2017
Remarkable preservation of terpenoids and record of volatile signalling in plant-animal interactions from Miocene amber,,INDIRECT DEFENSE; ESSENTIAL OIL; LEAVES; FOSSIL; (E)-BETA-CARYOPHYLLENE; DIPTEROCARPACEAE; BIOSYNTHESIS; HERBIVORES; FLOWERS; FAMILY,"Plants produce and release a large array of volatile organic compounds that play many ecological functions. These volatile plant metabolites serve as pollinator attractants, herbivore and pathogen repellents and protect plants from abiotic stresses. To date, the geological evolution of these organic compounds remains unknown. The preservation potential of these metabolites in the fossil record is very poor due to their low boiling points. Here we report a series of volatile sesquiterpenoids, including delta-elemene, alpha-copaene, beta-elemene, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, germacrene D, delta-cadiene and spathunenol, from early Miocene (similar to 17 million year) amber from eastern India. The survival of these unaltered bioterpenoids can be attributed to the existence of extraordinary taphonomic conditions conducive to the preservation of volatile biomolecules through deep time. Furthermore, the occurrence of these volatiles in the early Miocene amber suggests that the plants from this period had evolved metabolic pathways to synthesize these organic molecules to play an active role in forest ecology, especially in plant-animal interactions.",2017

Flying arthropods play important roles in these processes as pollinators, decomposers, and predators, and can be important in structuring food webs. The goal of this study was to identify associations between urbanization and the composition of communities of flying (and floating) arthropods within gardens and parks in a medium-sized mesic city. We predicted that flying arthropod abundance and diversity would respond strongly to percent impervious surface and distance to city center, measurements of urbanization. Flying arthropods were sampled from 30 gardens and parks along an urbanization gradient in Toledo, Ohio, during July and August 2016, using elevated pan traps. A variety of potential predictor variables were also recorded at each site. We collected a total of 2,369 individuals representing nine orders. We found that flying arthropod community composition was associated with percent impervious surface and canopy cover. Overall flying arthropod abundance was negatively associated with percent impervious surface and positively associated with distance to city center. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Araneae (spiders) were positively associated with distance to city center. Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera (flieS), and Araneae were negatively associated with', percent impervious surface. Both distance to city center and percent impervious surface are metrics of urbanization, and this study shows how these factors influence flying arthropod communities in urban gardens and city parks, including significant reductions in taxa that contain pollinators and predators important to urban agriculture and forestry. A variety of environmental factors also showed significant associations with responses (e.g. canopy cover and soil moisture), suggesting these factors may underlie or modulate the urbanization effects. More research is needed to determine mechanisms of change.",2017

Here we report the nuclear and mitochondrial genome sequences of the orchid bee Euglossa dilemma Bembe & Eltz. E. dilemma was selected because it is widely distributed, highly abundant, and it was recently naturalized in the southeastern United States. We provide a high-quality assembly of the 3.3 Gb genome, and an official gene set of 15,904 gene annotations. We find high conservation of gene synteny with the honey bee throughout 80 MY of divergence time.

5 Key Challenges and Solutions for Governing Complex Adaptive (Food) Systems,agriculture; food systems; complex adaptive systems; environmental governance,SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; URBAN LAND TELECONNECTIONS; ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; NEW-ZEALAND; TASMAN BAY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEST-CONTROL; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT,"There is increasing recognition in academic circles of the importance of adaptive governance for the sustainability of social-ecological systems, but little examination of specific implications for the 34% of land-use where human activities are pervasive but potentially commensurate with functioning ecosystems: agricultural production systems. In this paper, we argue for the need to view food systems and agro-ecosystems as multi-scalar complex adaptive systems and identify five key challenging characteristics of such systems: multi-causality; cumulative impacts; regime shifts; teleconnections and mismatch of scales. These characteristics are necessary features of multi-scalar adaptive systems, and apply equally to social and natural subsystems. We discuss the implications of these characteristics for agricultural production systems and consider how governance can rise to these challenges. We present five case studies that highlight these issues: pollinator declines; payments for ecosystem services; pest control and pesticide resistance; downstream aquatic systems in Tasman Bay, New Zealand; and riparian buffers in Puget Sound, USA. From these case studies we derive recommendations for managing agricultural systems, both specific and general. Ultimately, adaptive governance of agro-ecosystems will likely hinge upon three paradigm shifts: viewing farmers and ranchers not only as food producers but also as land and water managers; seeking not yield maximization but rather resilient management of food ecosystems; and critically, as it transcends the production-system literature, engaging broad audiences not only as consumers but also citizens.",2017

Problems may arise ecologically if birds arrive or depart before or after associated food resources such as plants or insects reach critical lifecycle stages. Here, I compare mean first arrival dates of the Rufous Hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus), a prolific pollinator and long-distance migrant with the northernmost breeding range of any North American hummingbird, between 1895-1969 and 2006-2015 at eight observation locations in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. Historical arrivals were reported through the North American Bird Phenology Program, and recent arrivals were estimated from temporal occupancy patterns using eBird checklists. Results indicated that hummingbirds arrived 8 and 11 days later in the recent time period in two coastal cities in Oregon and 7-17 days earlier in northern, more inland cities in Washington and British Columbia. Fewer days were noted between arrivals in more northerly areas in the recent time period suggesting that birds may now be migrating faster than in the previous time period. Spring temperatures have increased in the past century in much of this region, and birds arrived earlier in years with warmer spring temperatures to suggest that migratory advances are climate-related. Later mean first arrivals reported in coastal regions of Oregon in the recent time period may suggest that Rufous Hummingbirds are bypassing coastal areas to take advantage of more predictable conditions along inland migratory routes or are shifting their breeding ranges northward, notions both supported by declining population trends observed in Breeding Bird Survey data. My results demonstrate a climate-related advancement of Rufous Hummingbirds in western North America and provide justification for the investigation of the ecological impacts of climate change on birds in coastal vs. inland environments. In addition, I provide a framework for comparing information from two extensive and emerging datasets to better understand the impacts of climate change on birds at broad spatial and temporal scales.",2017
"POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF POLYLEPIS TOMENTELLA (ROSACEAE), AN ANDEAN ANEMOPHILOUS TREE PRESENTING A POTENTIAL FLORAL FUNGAL INFECTION",pollen limitation; potential floral fungal infection; prezygotic self-incompatibility; treeline; wind pollination,POLLEN LIMITATION; WIND POLLINATION; MICROBOTRYUM-VIOLACEUM; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; SILENE-LATIFOLIA; BREEDING SYSTEM; POPULATION-SIZE; SEED PRODUCTION,"Premise of research. Anemophily is considered to be a mechanism that evolved to promote pollination success. However, reproductive output can decrease if pollen loads are scarce due to low abundance of compatible mates or floral infections. Here we analyze the effects of breeding system, pollen limitation, and a potential floral fungal infection on the reproductive output of the Andean tree Polylepis tomentella (Rosaceae). Methodology. We performed pollen supplementation experiments in the field to assess the extent of the effect of pollen limitation on fruit and seed set and to identify any pre- or postzygotic self-incompatibility responses within receptive pistils. Supplementary scanning electron microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy were used to observe the possible effects of a potential floral fungal infection on sexual reproduction. Pivotal results. Pollen supplementation did not increase fruit and seed set, suggesting weak evidence of pollen limitation. Most stigmas from self-and cross-pollinated flowers showed germinated pollen grains and pollen tubes in the style, indicating that the species exhibits prezygotic self-compatibility. The presence of three Ascomycota genera in stigmas and styles appears to have negatively affected the germination of pollen grains by inhibiting pollen tube growth, but we did not find evidence suggesting that hyphae are able to penetrate the ovary. Conclusions. This study showed that P. tomentella possesses a prezygotic self-compatible system and that fruit and seed set are not affected by pollen limitation. Therefore, reproductive assurance is achieved through pollen transfer between plants by wind and the role played by self-compatibility that allows selfing in the species. However, it is possible that the potential fungal infection could reduce the fecundity of its tree host, as hyphae are able to penetrate pollen grains.",2017
The benefits of hedgerows for pollinators and natural enemies depends on hedge quality and landscape context,Ecosystem services; Hedgerows; Pollination; Pollinators; Pest regulation; Natural enemies; Ecological intensification,PEST-CONTROL; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; STAPHYLINID BEETLES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WINTER-WHEAT; NATIVE BEES; MANAGEMENT; FIELD; RESTORATION; ABUNDANCE,"Ecological intensification advocates the harnessing of regulating and supporting ecosystem services to promote more sustainable food production, and this relies on effective management of non-cropped habitats. Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification.",2017
Sexual forms and their ecological correlates of flowering plants in Siberia,sexual forms; Siberia; flora; ecological correlates,DIOECIOUS ANGIOSPERMS; FOREST TREES; POLLINATION; FLORA; SYSTEMS; TRAITS; ISLAND,"The flora of Siberia includes 4500 species, 815 genera, and 123 families of angiosperms. The causes of the relationship between sexual forms and such ecological and biological features of plants as the life form, the mode of pollination, pericarp's consistency, habitat type, zonal group, and the ecological group in relation to moistening were analyzed and discussed. For the first time, we demonstrated that gynomonoecy in the flora of Siberia was associated with a semiwoody growth form, pollination by wind, and propagation in zonal communities. It was revealed that gynodioecy in Siberia was associated with a semiwoody growth form, circumpolar or Eurasian distribution, and floodplain meadows. It was found that the ratio of dioecious and hermaphrodite plants in the ecological-biological complexes of species directly depends on the frequency of the abundance of species with endemic areas.",2017
Resource Allocation and Seed Size Selection in Perennial Plants under Pollen Limitation,adult survival; diminishing return; ovule production; pollen limitation; reproductive allocation; seed size,STABLE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES; SEXUAL ORGANISMS; SELF-FERTILIZATION; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; FLOWERING PLANTS; CONSEQUENCES; POLLINATION; EVOLUTIONARY; INVESTMENT; PATTERNS,"Pollen limitation may affect resource allocation patterns in plants, but its role in the selection of seed size is not known. Using an evolutionarily stable strategy model of resource allocation in perennial iteroparous plants, we show that under density-independent population growth, pollen limitation (i.e., a reduction in ovule fertilization rate) should increase the optimal seed size. At any level of pollen limitation (including none), the optimal seed size maximizes the ratio of juvenile survival rate to the resource investment needed to produce one seed (including both ovule production and seed provisioning); that is, the optimum maximizes the fitness effect per unit cost. Seed investment may affect allocation to postbreeding adult survival. In our model, pollen limitation increases individual seed size but decreases overall reproductive allocation, so that pollen limitation should also increase the optimal allocation to postbreeding adult survival. Under density-dependent population growth, the optimal seed size is inversely proportional to ovule fertilization rate. However, pollen limitation does not affect the optimal allocation to postbreeding adult survival and ovule production. These results highlight the importance of allocation trade-offs in the effect pollen limitation has on the ecology and evolution of seed size and postbreeding adult survival in perennial plants.",2017

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway. It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States, and from the lowland Mediterranean zone. 3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks, including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded. 4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a hormone that regulates insect development. 5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient availability and lack of management. 6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and, conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland, heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.",2017

Despite their striking appearance, role as pollinator predators, and intriguing biogeographic distribution, phylogenetic relationships within Phymatinae are largely unknown and the evolutionary history of the subfamily has remained in the dark. We here utilize the most extensive molecular phylogeny of ambush bugs to date, generated from a 3328 base pair molecular dataset, to refine our understanding of phymatine relationships, estimate dates of divergence (BEAST 2), and uncover historical biogeographic patterns (S-DIVA and DEC). This taxon set (39 species of Phymatinae and six outgroups) allowed reevaluation of the proposed sister group of Phymatinae and tribal-level relationships within the group, and for the first time proposes species-level relationships within Phymata Latreille, the largest genus of ambush bugs (similar to 109 spp.). Available evidence suggests that Phymata originated in the Neotropical region, with subsequent dispersals to the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. This study provides a framework for future research investigating the evolutionary history of ambush bugs, as well as ecological and microevolutionary investigations. ",2017
Evolutionary relationships among pollinators and repeated pollinator sharing in sexually deceptive orchids,convergent evolution; phylogenetics; pollination; sexual deception; specialization; speciation,AUSTRALIAN FLORISTIC REGION; THYNNINE WASPS HYMENOPTERA; CALADENIA ORCHIDACEAE; SPECIALIZED POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; DRIVEN SPECIATION; BEES HYMENOPTERA; CHEMICAL ECOLOGY; FLORAL ISOLATION; SOUTHERN AFRICA,"The mechanism of pollinator attraction is predicted to strongly influence both plant diversification and the extent of pollinator sharing between species. Sexually deceptive orchids rely on mimicry of species-specific sex pheromones to attract their insect pollinators. Given that sex pheromones tend to be conserved among related species, we predicted that in sexually deceptive orchids, (i) pollinator sharing is rare, (ii) closely related orchids use closely related pollinators and (iii) there is strong bias in the wasp lineages exploited by orchids. We focused on species that are pollinated by sexual deception of thynnine wasps in the distantly related genera Caladenia and Drakaea, including new field observations for 45 species of Caladenia. Specialization was extreme with most orchids using a single pollinator species. Unexpectedly, seven cases of pollinator sharing were found, including two between Caladenia and Drakaea, which exhibit strikingly different floral morphology. Phylogenetic analysis of pollinators using four nuclear sequence loci demonstrated that although orchids within major clades primarily use closely related pollinator species, up to 17% of orchids within these clades are pollinated by a member of a phylogenetically distant wasp genus. Further, compared to the total diversity of thynnine wasps within the study region, orchids show a strong bias towards exploiting certain genera. Although these patterns may arise through conservatism in the chemical classes used in sex pheromones, apparent switches between wasp clades suggest unexpected flexibility in floral semiochemical production. Alternatively, wasp sex pheromones within lineages may exhibit greater chemical diversity than currently appreciated.",2017
Reorganization of interaction networks modulates the persistence of species in late successional stages,community control; network reorganization; plant-herbivore interactions; species coexistence; structural stability; succession dynamics,PLANT-MEDIATED COMPETITION; HERBIVORE COMPETITION; POLLINATOR NETWORKS; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; RESISTANCE; TURNOVER; STABILITY; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES,"Ecological interaction networks constantly reorganize as interspecific interactions change across successional stages and environmental gradients. This reorganization can also be associated with the extent to which species change their preference for types of niches available in their local sites. Despite the pervasiveness of these interaction changes, previous studies have revealed that network reorganizations have a minimal or insignificant effect on global descriptors of network architecture, such as connectance, modularity and nestedness. However, little is known about whether these reorganizations may have an effect on community dynamics and composition. To answer the question above, we study the multi-year dynamics and reorganization of plant-herbivore interaction networks across secondary successional stages of a tropical dry forest. We develop new quantitative tools based on a structural stability approach to estimate the potential impact of network reorganization on species persistence. Then, we investigate whether this impact can explain the likelihood of persistence of herbivore species in the observed communities. We find that resident (early-arriving) herbivore species increase their likelihood of persistence across time and successional stages. Importantly, we demonstrate that, in late successional stages, the reorganization of interactions among resident species has a strong inhibitory effect on the likelihood of persistence of colonizing (late-arriving) herbivores. These findings support earlier predictions suggesting that, in mature communities, changes of species interactions can act as community-control mechanisms (also known as priority effects). Furthermore, our results illustrate that the dynamics and composition of ecological communities cannot be fully understood without attention to their reorganization processes, despite the invariability of global network properties.",2017
Neglected pollinators: Can enhanced pollination services improve cocoa yields?

Ecological intensification is such a production strategy, whereby yield increase is promoted through reduced agrochemical inputs and increased regulating ecosystem services such as pollination. However, we still know little about cocoa pollination ecology and services, although they appear to be key to understand yield functions. Here, we provide an extensive literature review on cocoa pollination focusing on three main aspects: non-plant (external) and plant regulated (internal) factors affecting pollination, pollinator agents, and ecological intensification management for enhancing pollination success and yield. Pollination services by many arthropod groups such as ants, bees, and parasitic wasps, and not only ceratopogonids, may be a way to increase cocoa productivity and secure smallholders income, but their role is unknown. Several environmental and socioeconomic factors can blur potential pollination benefits. Current knowledge gaps preclude our understanding of how to (i) identify the major pollinator species, (ii) disentangle the direct or indirect role of ants in pollination, (iii) design effective habitat improvements for pollination (by litter and shade management), and (iv) quantify the yield gaps due to pollination limitation. Optimizing cocoa pollination alone appears to be a powerful ecological tool to increase the yield of smallholders, but experimental research is required to validate these results in a realistic setting. In general, industry, governments and smallholders need to develop more joined efforts to ecological produdtion strategies. In particular, farm-base management innovations based on robust scientific evidence must be designed to meet the increasing demand for chocolate and to mitigate cocoa yield gaps. This review suggests that diversified systems and associated ecosystem services, such as pollination, can help to achieve such goals.",2017

Previous studies using remote camera footage and qualitative floral trait classification have suggested that the geoflorous Cape shrubs Protea cordata, P. decurrens, P. scabra, and P. subulifolia are pollinated by small mammals. This study investigates the floral traits and breeding systems of these species and their reliance on small mammals for seed production. The floral traits of these Protea species - including yeasty-scented, cryptic inflorescences with a short (14-19mm) distance between nectar and pollen presenter -suggested that small mammals are the likely pollinators of these species. Results from controlled hand-pollination experiments indicated that P. cordata and P. scabra are self-incompatible, and thus rely on external vectors for seed production, and that P. decurrens is self-compatible. Selective exclosure experiments suggested that insects contribute to the pollination of P. cordata and P. scabra since the exclusion of vertebrates lowered but did not significantly reduce seed set. However, hand cross-pollination did not increase seed set in either species, indicative of resource limitation. We conclude that mammals and insects contribute to reproductive success in these largely self-incompatible species.",2017
Honey bee foraging ecology: Season but not landscape diversity shapes the amount and diversity of collected pollen,,COLONY DEVELOPMENT; APIS-MELLIFERA; NUTRITION; SAMPLES; DIET,"The availability of pollen in agricultural landscapes is essential for the successful growth and reproduction of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.). The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes.",2017
Diversification and spatial structuring in the mutualism between Ficus septica and its pollinating wasps in insular South East Asia,Biogeography; Ceratosolen; Mutualism; Philippines; Speciation,ECOLOGICAL CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; FIG-WASPS; HYMENOPTERA CHALCIDOIDEA; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; ISLAND ARCHIPELAGO; OGASAWARA ISLANDS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CHEMICAL MIMICRY; SPECIES-PAIRS; POPULATION,"Background: Interspecific interactions have long been assumed to play an important role in diversification. Mutualistic interactions, such as nursery pollination mutualisms, have been proposed as good candidates for diversification through co-speciation because of their intricate nature. However, little is known about how speciation and diversification proceeds in emblematic nursery pollination systems such as figs and fig wasps. Here, we analyse diversification in connection with spatial structuring in the obligate mutualistic association between Ficus septica and its pollinating wasps throughout the Philippines and Taiwan. Results: Ceratosolen wasps pollinating F. septica are structured into a set of three vicariant black coloured species, and a fourth yellow coloured species whose distribution overlaps with those of the black species. However, two black pollinator species were found to co-occur on Lanyu island. Microsatellite data on F. septica indicates the presence of three gene pools that broadly mirrors the distribution of the three black clades. Moreover, receptive fig odours, the specific message used by pollinating wasps to locate their host tree, varied among locations. Conclusions: F. septica and its black pollinator clades exhibited similar geographic structuring. This could be due originally to geographic barriers leading to isolation, local adaptation, and finally co-structuring. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of two black pollinator species on Lanyu island suggests that the parapatric distribution of the black clades is now maintained by the inability of migrating individuals of black pollinators to establish populations outside their range. On the other hand, the distribution of the yellow clade strongly suggests an initial case of character displacement followed by subsequent range extension: in our study system, phenotypic or microevolutionary plasticity has allowed the yellow clade to colonise hosts presenting distinct odours. Hence, while variation in receptive fig odours allows specificity in the interaction, this variation does not necessarily lead to coevolutionary plant-insect diversification. Globally, our results evidence evolutionary plasticity in the fig-fig wasp mutualism. This is the first documentation of the presence of two distinct processes in pollinating fig wasp diversification on a host species: the formation of vicariant species and the co-occurrence of other species over large parts of their ranges probably made possible by character displacement.",2017
First fossil of an oestroid fly (Diptera: Calyptratae: Oestroidea) and the dating of oestroid divergences,,DOMINICAN AMBER; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS; MORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; TACHINIDAE DIPTERA; NUCLEAR GENES; CALLIPHORIDAE; MITOCHONDRIAL; DIVERSIFICATION; SARCOPHAGIDAE; BLOWFLIES,"Calyptrate flies include about 22,000 extant species currently classified into Hippoboscoidea (tsetse, louse, and bat flies), the muscoid grade (house flies and relatives) and the Oestroidea (blow flies, bot flies, flesh flies, and relatives). Calyptrates are abundant in nearly all terrestrial ecosystems, often playing key roles as decomposers, parasites, parasitoids, vectors of pathogens, and pollinators. For oestroids, the most diverse group within calyptrates, definitive fossils have been lacking. The first unambiguous fossil of Oestroidea is described based on a specimen discovered in amber from the Dominican Republic. The specimen was identified through digital dissection by CT scans, which provided morphological data for a cladistic analysis of its phylogenetic position among extant oestroids. The few known calyptrate fossils were used as calibration points for a molecular phylogeny (16S, 28S, CAD) to estimate the timing of major diversification events among the Oestroidea. Results indicate that: (a) the fossil belongs to the family Mesembrinellidae, and it is identified and described as Mesembrinella caenozoica sp. nov.; (b) the mesembrinellids form a sister clade to the Australian endemic Ulurumyia macalpinei (Ulurumyiidae) (McAlpine's fly), which in turn is sister to all remaining oestroids; (c) the most recent common ancestor of extant Calyptratae lived just before the K-Pg boundary (ca. 70 mya); and (d) the radiation of oestroids began in the Eocene (ca. 50 mya), with the origin of the family Mesembrinellidae dated at ca. 40 mya. These results provide new insight into the timing and rate of oestroid diversification and highlight the rapid radiation of some of the most diverse and ecologically important families of flies.",2017
Context-dependent medicinal effects of anabasine and infection-dependent toxicity in bumble bees,,HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; HOST-PARASITE SYSTEM; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CRITHIDIA-BOMBI; SECONDARY METABOLITES; TRYPANOSOME PARASITE; INTESTINAL PATHOGEN; COMBINED PESTICIDE; NECTAR-NICOTINE; COLONY FITNESS,"Background Floral phytochemicals are ubiquitous in nature, and can function both as antimicrobials and as insecticides. Although many phytochemicals act as toxins and deterrents to consumers, the same chemicals may counteract disease and be preferred by infected individuals. The roles of nectar and pollen phytochemicals in pollinator ecology and conservation are complex, with evidence for both toxicity and medicinal effects against parasites. However, it remains unclear how consistent the effects of phytochemicals are across different parasite lineages and environmental conditions, and whether pollinators actively self-medicate with these compounds when infected. Approach Here, we test effects of the nectar alkaloid anabasine, found in Nicotiana, on infection intensity, dietary preference, and survival and performance of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens). We examined variation in the effects of anabasine on infection with different lineages of the intestinal parasite Crithidia under pollen-fed and pollen-starved conditions. Results We found that anabasine did not reduce infection intensity in individual bees infected with any of four Crithidia lineages that were tested in parallel, nor did anabasine reduce infection intensity in microcolonies of queenless workers. In addition, neither anabasine nor its isomer, nicotine, was preferred by infected bees in choice experiments, and infected bees consumed less anabasine than did uninfected bees under no-choice conditions. Furthermore, anabasine exacerbated the negative effects of infection on bee survival and microcolony performance. Anabasine reduced infection in only one experiment, in which bees were deprived of pollen and post-pupal contact with nestmates. In this experiment, anabasine had antiparasitic effects in bees from only two of four colonies, and infected bees exhibited reduced-rather than increased-phytochemical consumption relative to uninfected bees. Conclusions Variation in the effect of anabasine on infection suggests potential modulation of tritrophic interactions by both host genotype and environmental variables. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bombus impatiens prefer diets without nicotine and anabasine, and suggest that the medicinal effects and toxicity of anabasine may be context dependent. Future research should identify the specific environmental and genotypic factors that determine whether nectar phytochemicals have medicinal or deleterious effects on pollinators.",2017
The heat shock response and humoral immune response are mutually antagonistic in honey bees,,UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; GALLERIA-MELLONELLA LARVAE; APIS-MELLIFERA L.; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; STRESS-RESPONSE; C-ELEGANS; TRANSLATIONAL INHIBITION; ORGANISMAL PROTEOSTASIS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER,"The honey bee is of paramount importance to humans in both agricultural and ecological settings. Honey bee colonies have suffered from increased attrition in recent years, stemming from complex interacting stresses. Defining common cellular stress responses elicited by these stressors represents a key step in understanding potential synergies. The proteostasis network is a highly conserved network of cellular stress responses involved in maintaining the homeostasis of protein production and function. Here, we have characterized the Heat Shock Response (HSR), one branch of this network, and found that its core components are conserved. In addition, exposing bees to elevated temperatures normally encountered by honey bees during typical activities results in robust HSR induction with increased expression of specific heat shock proteins that was variable across tissues. Surprisingly, we found that heat shock represses multiple immune genes in the abdomen and additionally showed that wounding the cuticle of the abdomen results in decreased expression of multiple HSR genes in proximal and distal tissues. This mutually antagonistic relationship between the HSR and immune activation is unique among invertebrates studied to date and may promote understanding of potential synergistic effects of disparate stresses in this critical pollinator and social insects more broadly.",2017
Increasing spring temperatures favor oak seed production in temperate areas,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACORN PRODUCTION; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; QUERCUS-ILEX; MAST; DROUGHT; GROWTH; TREE; POLLINATION; CALIFORNIA,"The changes in reproductive phenology (i.e. timing of flowering and fruiting) observed in recent decades demonstrate that tree reproduction has already been altered by climate change. However, understanding the impact of these changes in reproductive success and fitness remains a major challenge for ecologists. We describe here a previously unreported phenomenon: a significant increase in the reproductive effort (seed production) of temperate oaks with increasing spring temperature, observed over the last decade. In contrast, no relationship was found between seed production and precipitation. This sensitivity of seed production to temperature was confirmed by a ""space-for-time"" substitution based on elevation gradients. Our findings suggest that global warming may enhance oak reproductive effort in temperate ecosystems. Nevertheless, while fitness can be enhanced by higher levels of seed production, it also depends on the frequency and synchronization of mast seeding production, which may also be influenced by climate change.",2017
Exotic species enhance response diversity to land-use change but modify functional composition,functional redundancy; response diversity; biodiversity; ecosystem function; agricultural intensification; pollination,BEE POLLINATORS; NEW-ZEALAND; INSURANCE HYPOTHESIS; GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; NATIVE POLLINATORS; CROP POLLINATION; FLOWER VISITORS; MODEL SELECTION,"Two main mechanisms may buffer ecosystem functions despite biodiversity loss. First, multiple species could share similar ecological roles, thus providing functional redundancy. Second, species may respond differently to environmental change (response diversity). However, ecosystem function would be best protected when functionally redundant species also show response diversity. This linkage has not been studied directly, so we investigated whether native and exotic pollinator species with similar traits (functional redundancy) differed in abundance (response diversity) across an agricultural intensification gradient. Exotic pollinator species contributed most positive responses, which partially stabilized overall abundance of the pollinator community. However, although some functionally redundant species exhibited response diversity, this was not consistent across functional groups and aggregate abundances within each functional group were rarely stabilized. This shows functional redundancy and response diversity do not always operate in concert. Hence, despite exotic species becoming increasingly dominant in human-modified systems, they cannot replace the functional composition of native species.",2017
"Altitudinal gradients, biogeographic history and microhabitat adaptation affect fine-scale spatial genetic structure in African and Neotropical populations of an ancient tropical tree species",,RAIN-FOREST TREE; SYMPHONIA-GLOBULIFERA CLUSIACEAE; TAMARINS LEONTOPITHECUS-ROSALIA; SEED-DISPERSAL; POLLEN DISPERSAL; FRENCH-GUIANA; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; CERATOGYMNA HORNBILLS; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; BRAZILIAN AMAZON,"The analysis of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) within populations can provide insights into eco-evolutionary processes. Restricted dispersal and locally occurring genetic drift are the primary causes for FSGS at equilibrium, as described in the isolation by distance (IBD) model. Beyond IBD expectations, spatial, environmental or historical factors can affect FSGS. We examined FSGS in seven African and Neotropical populations of the late-successional rain forest tree Symphonia globulifera L.f. (Clusiaceae) to discriminate the influence of drift-dispersal vs. landscape/ecological features and historical processes on FSGS. We used spatial principal component analysis and Bayesian clustering to assess spatial genetic heterogeneity at SSRs and examined its association with plastid DNA and habitat features. African populations (from Cameroon and Sao Tome A) displayed a stronger FSGS than Neotropical populations at both marker types (mean Sp = 0.025 vs. Sp = 0.008 at SSRs) and had a stronger spatial genetic heterogeneity. All three African populations occurred in pronounced altitudinal gradients, possibly restricting animal-mediated seed dispersal. Cyto-nuclear disequilibria in Cameroonian populations also suggested a legacy of biogeographic history to explain these genetic patterns. Conversely, Neotropical populations exhibited a weaker FSGS, which may reflect more efficient wide-ranging seed dispersal by Neotropical bats and other dispersers. The population from French Guiana displayed an association of plastid haplotypes with two morphotypes characterized by differential habitat preferences. Our results highlight the importance of the microenvironment for eco-evolutionary processes within persistent tropical tree populations.",2017
Evolutionary flexibility in five hummingbird/plant mutualistic systems: testing temporal and geographic matching,Andes; Centropogon; Chuquiraga; co-evolution; distribution ranges; Eutoxeres; Oreotrochilus hummingbirds; pollination,ASTERACEAE-BARNADESIOIDEAE; BELLFLOWERS CAMPANULACEAE; PHYLOGENY; NECTAR; DIVERSIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; COEVOLUTION; CHUQUIRAGA; AMERICA,"Aim Partners in co-evolutionary interactions must be ecologically interdependent and at least at some stage have matching traits and more or less overlapping ranges. As co-evolution is a process, neither the mutual dependence nor the trait and range matching are expected to be static or perfect. Here we investigate the extent of evolutionary flexibility in tight pollination mutualisms between hummingbirds and plants, ranging from straight-billed species to sicklebills. Location The Americas. Methods The five considered pollination mutualisms are between the following hummingbird and plant species: Calypte anna and Ribes speciosum (Grossulariaceae); Basilinna xantusii and Arbutus peninsularis (Ericaceae); two species of Sephanoides and Tristerix aphyllus/corymbosus (Loranthaceae); two species of Eutoxeres and 34 species of curved-corolla Centropogon (Campanulaceae); and six species of Oreotrochilus and seven species of Chuquiraga (Asteraceae). While ecological interdependence and trait matching in these mutualisms are well established, geographic occurrence data and molecular clock-based ages for the 10 clades were newly compiled. Results We found matching bird and plant stem ages in two of the five systems and (much) older bird than plant ages in the other three. The implied adaptation of plant populations to already existing hummingbird species fits with the modelled distributions. In three of the systems, the ranges of the plants overlap those of their pollinators by >90%; conversely, the range overlap between the bird species and the plant species they pollinate is much less than that. Surprisingly, the age mismatch was greatest in the Eutoxeres/Centropogon system, in spite of the perfect morphological fit among bills and corollas, illustrating the evolutionary flexibility of these mutualisms and the apparently rapid addition' of further plant species. Main conclusions These findings illuminate the macroevolutionary assembly of hummingbird/plant mutualisms, which has been highly dynamic, even in specialized systems with perfect morphological trait fitting.",2017
Trait space of rare plants in a fire-dependent ecosystem,leaf dry matter content; longleaf pine savanna; plant functional traits; species rarity; specific leaf area,LEAF ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; LONGLEAF PINE FORESTS; RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; VASCULAR FLORA; FLAMMABILITY; RESTORATION; EXTINCTION; POLLINATOR,"The causes of species rarity are of critical concern because of the high extinction risk associated with rarity. Studies examining individual rare species have limited generality, whereas trait-based approaches offer a means to identify functional causes of rarity that can be applied to communities with disparate species pools. Differences in functional traits between rare and common species may be indicative of the functional causes of species rarity and may therefore be useful in crafting species conservation strategies. However, there is a conspicuous lack of studies comparing the functional traits of rare species and co-occurring common species. We measured 18 important functional traits for 19 rare and 134 common understory plant species from North Carolina's Sandhills region and compared their trait distributions to determine whether there are significant functional differences that may explain species rarity. Flowering, fire, and tissue-chemistry traits differed significantly between rare and common, co-occurring species. Differences in specific traits suggest that fire suppression has driven rarity in this system and that changes to the timing and severity of prescribed fire may improve conservation success. Our method provides a useful tool to prioritize conservation efforts in other systems based on the likelihood that rare species are functionally capable of persisting.",2017
How does a plant orchestrate defense in time and space? Using glucosinolates in Arabidopsis as case study,,CIRCADIAN CLOCK; SECONDARY METABOLITES; S-CELLS; THALIANA; TRANSPORT; PATHWAY; LEAVES; TRANSCRIPTION; BIOSYNTHESIS; EXPRESSION,"The sessile nature of plants has caused plants to develop means to defend themselves against attacking organisms. Multiple strategies range from physical barriers to chemical warfare including pre-formed anticipins as well as phytoalexins produced only upon attack. While phytoalexins require rapid induction, constitutive defenses can impose ecological costs if they deter pollinators or attract specialized herbivores. In the model Arabidopsis thaliana, the well-characterized glucosinolate anticipins are categorized into different classes, aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, depending on their amino acid precursor. Using glucosinolates in Arabidopsis as case study, we will discuss how plants orchestrate synthesis, storage and activation of pre-formed defense compounds spatially and temporally.",2017
Factors contributing to the accumulation of reproductive isolation: A mixed model approach,comparative methods; reproductive isolation; speciation; sympatry,SEXUAL SELECTION; MANTEL TEST; MONKEYFLOWERS MIMULUS; POSTZYGOTIC ISOLATION; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; ECOLOGICAL ISOLATION; REGRESSION APPROACH; FLORAL TRAITS; SPECIATION; PATTERNS,"The analysis of large datasets describing reproductive isolation between species has been extremely influential in the study of speciation. However, the statistical methods currently used for these data limit the ability to make direct inferences about the factors predicting the evolution of reproductive isolation. As a result, our understanding of iconic patterns and rules of speciation rely on indirect analyses that have clear statistical limitations. Phylogenetic mixed models are commonly used in ecology and evolution, but have not been applied to studies of reproductive isolation. Here I describe a flexible framework using phylogenetic mixed models to analyze data collected at different evolutionary scales, to test both categorical and continuous predictor variables, and to test the effect of multiple predictors on rates and patterns of reproductive isolation simultaneously. I demonstrate the utility of this framework by re-analyzing four classic datasets, from both animals and plants, and evaluating several hypotheses that could not be tested in the original studies: In the Drosophila and Bufonidae datasets, I found support for more rapid accumulation of reproductive isolation in sympatric species pairs compared to allopatric species pairs. Using Silene and Nolana, I found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that floral differentiation elevates postzygotic reproductive isolation. The faster accumulation of postzygotic isolation in sympatry is likely the result of species coexistence determined by the level of postzygotic isolation between species. In addition, floral trait divergence does not appear to translate into pleiotropic effects on postzygotic reproductive isolation. Overall, these methods can allow researchers to test new hypotheses using a single statistical method, while remedying the statistical limitations of several previous methods.",2017
Adaptations of the floral characteristics and biomass allocation patterns of Gentiana hexaphylla to the altitudinal gradient of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,Biomass allocation; Reproductive strategy; Altitudinal gradient; Alpine meadows; Floral characteristics; Gentiana hexaphylla,HIGH TEMPERATE ANDES; REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; ALPINE RANUNCULUS; CENTRAL CHILE; PLANTS; SIZE; TRAITS; FLOWER; ENVIRONMENT,"This study addressed the floral component traits and biomass allocation patterns of Gentiana hexaphylla as well as the relationships of these parameters along an elevation gradient (approximately 3700 m, 3800 m, 3900 m, and 4000 m) on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The plant height, floral characteristics, and biomass allocation of G. hexaphylla were measured at different altitudes after field sampling, sorting, and drying. Plant height was significantly greater at 3700 m than that at other elevations. Flower length was significantly greater at 4000 m than that at other elevations, whereas the flower length at low elevations showed no significant differences. Corolla diameter increased with altitude, although the difference was not significant between 3800 m and 3900 m. Variations in biomass accumulation, including the aboveground, photosynthetic organ, flower and belowground biomasses, showed non-linear responses to changes in altitude. The aboveground and photosynthetic organ biomasses reached their lowest values at 4000 m, whereas the belowground and flower biomass reached minimum values at 3700 m. The sexual reproductive allocation of G. hexaphylla also increased with altitude, with a maximum observed at 4000 m. These results suggest that external environmental factors and altitudinal gradients as well as the biomass accumulation and allocation of G. hexaphylla play crucial roles in plant traits and significantly affect the ability of this species to adapt to harsh environments. The decreased number of flowers observed at higher altitudes may indicate a compensatory response for the lack of pollinators at high elevations, which is also suggested by the deformed flower shapes at high altitudes. In addition, the individual plant biomass (i.e., plant size) had significantly effect on flower length and corolla diameter. Based on the organ biomass results, the optimal altitude for G. hexaphylla in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 3800 m, where the plant exhibits minimum propagule biomass and asexual reproductive allocation.",2017

Little is known about this temporal dynamic and the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the structure of interaction networks. We evaluated changes in the structure of network interactions between bats and fruits in relation to variations in rainfall. Our results suggest that fruit abundance is the main variable responsible for temporal changes in network attributes, such as network size, connectance, and number of interactions. In the same way, temperature positively affected the abundance of fruits and bats. An increase in temperature and alterations in rainfall patterns, due to human induced climate change, can cause changes in phenological patterns and fruit production, with negative consequences to biodiversity maintenance, ecological interactions, and ecosystem functioning.

Pollen from Eucalyptus-Myrceugenia glaucescens (Cambess.) D. Legrand and Kausel (Myrtaceae), Solanum sp.-Cyphomandra betacea (Cav.) Sendtn. (Solanaceae) and Erythrina crista-galli L. (Fabaceae) was dominant. 6 The ability to obtain pollen from poricidal anthers such as those of Solanum indicate the potential of X. augusti to be an excellent managed pollinator and a good candidate for pollinating Solanaceae, such as Solanum lycopersicum 'tomato' and Solanum melongena 'eggplant', which are economically important crops in this region.",2017

In contrast to most orchids, all of the ca. 170 Catasetum species have sexually dimorphic, unisexual flowers involved in a highly specialized pollination mechanism. Flowers of Catasetum produce strong floral perfumes that act as both attractant and reward for male euglossine bees. While collecting perfumes, euglossine males may remove the pollinarium from a male flower and subsequently deposit it in the stigmatic slit of a female flower, resulting in pollination. Here we present an overview of the existing literature on floral scent chemistry and pollinators of Catasetum and add new reports on the pollinators of some species. We provide some insights into the ecology and evolution of floral scents in the genus Catasetum and suggest directions for future research. We hope this review will stimulate research not only on the ecology and evolution of Catasetum but also of the about 1000 species of fragrance-rewarding plants that are found in the Neotropics.",2017
New records of an invasive bumble bee in northern Chile: expansion of its range or new introduction events?,Invasive species; Exotic bees; Pollinators; Corbiculate bees,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; TERRESTRIS L. HYMENOPTERA; ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; SOUTH-AMERICA; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; SAMPLING BIAS; APIDAE; PREDICTION,"The Eurasian bumble bee Bombus terrestris Linnaeus has been used commercially for pollination of a large number of crop species worldwide. This species has become invasive in several countries where it has escaped into natural environments. This species has become naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Gu,rin-M,neville. We report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species' southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile. These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris. Future surveys in the area should be intensified to evaluate if viable populations of this invasive species may become established.",2017
Dioecious plants are more precocious than cosexual plants: A comparative study of relative sizes at the onset of sexual reproduction in woody species,angiosperm; cosexuality; dioecy; onset of sexual reproduction; sex expression; woody plant,RAIN-FOREST TREES; EVERGREEN OAK FOREST; SEED DISPERSAL; POLLEN LIMITATION; FLOWERING PLANTS; PODOCARPUS-NAGI; TRAIT EVOLUTION; RANGE EXPANSION; HAWAIIAN FLORA; TROPICAL TREES,"The reproductive capacities of dioecious plant species may be limited by severe pollen limitation and narrow seed shadows for the two reasons. First, they are unable to self-pollinate, and seed production occurs only with pollinator movement from males to females. Second, only 50% of the individuals in populations contribute to seed production. Despite these handicaps, dioecious plants maintain their populations in plant communities with cooccurring cosexual plants, and no substantial difference in population growth rates has been found between dioecious and cosexual plants. Hence, dioecious plants are thought to mitigate these disadvantages by adopting ecological traits, such as insect pollination, animal-dispersed fleshy fruits, and precocious flowering. We studied the relationship between flowering and plant size in 30 woody species with different sex expressions, leaf habits, fruit types, and maximum plant sizes. The study site was located in an evergreen broad-leaved forest on the island of Honshu, Japan. A phylogenetic linear regression model showed that dioecious species tended to mature at smaller sizes than did cosexual taxa. At the population level, given equal plant densities and reproductive efforts, the precocity of dioecious plants could serve as one of the factors that mitigate the limitations of pollen and seed-shadow handicaps by increasing the density of reproductive individuals in the population. At the individual level, smaller size of onset of flowering may play a role in enhancing reproductive success over a lifetime by increasing reproductive opportunities. We discussed the possible effect of the relationship between precocity and some ecological traits of dioecious plants, such as small flowers pollinated by unspecialized insects, fleshy fruit dispersed by animals, and their preferential occurrence in the tropics and in island habitats. The universality of precocity among dioecious plants should be investigated in diverse plant communities. Such studies will increase our understanding of the evolution of plant breeding systems.",2017

Pollinators, such as bees, face the complex challenge of efficiently exploiting patchily distributed floral resources across large landscapes. 2. In the present study we consider the utility of spatial network statistics to analyse the foraging patterns of bees moving between feeding sites at various spatial and temporal scales. 3. We explain how spatial movement networks can be derived theoretically and experimentally to describe bee foraging decisions. 4. We illustrate this approach by analysing six datasets of bumblebees and honeybees foraging in arrays of artificial flowers, and showing how network metrics change as foragers gain experience with the spatial distribution of feeding sites. 5. We compare network analyses with more conventional statistics used to characterise bee foraging movements and discuss the implications of our novel statistical and modelling approach for pollination ecology.",2017

Polymerase chain reaction was also done with consensus primers. Pollen tube growth and nut set analyses were carried out on partially bagged limbs after self-pollination treatment. In spite of the fact that all genotypes had the S-f-allele and pollen tube growth were similar, nut set exhibited an alternate year characteristic that ranged from 16.2% to a maximum of 24.7%. This was the highest treatment after self-pollination. Difference existed between genotypes could be due to the genetic constitution of each genotype, is explored in set that is diminished by inbreeding, which diminish gene aggregation in different members of a progeny. In addition, flower morphology could also influence set in bagged limbs. Furthermore, with regard to flower sterility and bud density in relation to both pollination success and ecological condition availability, these traits must be considered when examining production in self-compatible almond orchards, e.g.,-the impacts accompanying inbreeding and effective autonomous self-pollination.",2017

A crucial problem in evolutionary ecology is therefore to understand how coevolving species diverge when they interact with a set of closely related species from another lineage rather than with a single species. We evaluated geographic differences in the floral morphology of all woodland star plant species (Lithophragma, Saxifragaceae) that are pollinated by Greya (Prodoxidae) moths. Flowers of each woodland star species differed depending on whether plants interact locally with one, two, or no pollinating moth species. Plants of one species grown in six different environments showed few differences in floral traits, suggesting that the geographic differences are not due significantly to trait plasticity. Greya moth populations also showed significant geographic divergence in morphology, depending on the local host and on whether the moth species co-occurred locally. Divergence in the plants and the moths involved shifts in combinations of partially correlated traits, rather than any one trait. The results indicate that the geographic mosaic of coevolution can be amplified as coevolving lineages diversify into separate species and come together in different combinations in different ecosystems.",2017
The messenger matters: Pollinator functional group influences mating system dynamics,ecological genetics; multiple paternity; plant mating systems; pollination,MULTIPLE PATERNITY; EVOLUTION,"The incredible diversity of plant mating systems has fuelled research in evolutionary biology for over a century. Currently, there is broad concern about the impact of rapidly changing pollinator communities on plant populations. Very few studies, however, examine patterns and mechanisms associated with multiple paternity from cross-pollen loads. Often, foraging pollinators collect a mixed pollen load that may result in the deposition of pollen from different sires to receptive stigmas. Coincident deposition of self- and cross-pollen leads to interesting mating system dynamics and has been investigated in numerous species. But, mixed pollen loads often consist of a diversity of cross-pollen and result in multiple sires of seeds within a fruit. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rhodes, Fant, and Skogen (2017) examine how pollinator identity and spatial isolation influence multiple paternity within fruits of a self-incompatible evening primrose. The authors demonstrate that pollen pool diversity varies between two pollinator types, hawkmoths and diurnal solitary bees. Further, progeny from more isolated plants were less likely to have multiple sires regardless of the pollinator type. Moving forward, studies of mating system dynamics should consider the implications of multiple paternity and move beyond the self- and cross-pollination paradigm. Rhodes et al. (2017) demonstrate the importance of understanding the roles that functionally diverse pollinators play in mating system dynamics.",2017

Mechanisms of aggregation in an ant-tended treehopper: Attraction to mutualists is balanced by conspecific competition,,PUBLILIA-CONCAVA; PATCH SIZE; JALMENUS-EVAGORAS; PARENTAL CARE; LIFE-HISTORY; DENSITY; PLANT; COEXISTENCE; POLLINATION; RESOURCE,"Understanding the spatial structure of populations and communities has been a dominant focus of ecological research, and spatial structure is increasingly seen as critical for understanding population dynamics. Habitat (or host) preference is a proximate mechanism that can generate aggregation or overdispersion, lending insight into the ultimate consequences of observed spatial distributions. Publilia concava is a univoltine phloem-feeding insect that forms mutualistic associations with ants, which consume honeydew and protect treehoppers from predation. Treehopper adults and nymphs are aggregated at the scale of golden-rod plant stems, and previous studies have suggested that this aggregation is an adaptive response that increases feeding performance or maximizes benefits of ant-tending. Previous studies have also shown experimentally that individual treehoppers preferentially oviposit on plants with ants present, but a complimentary hypothesis that treehoppers prefer to oviposit near conspecifics (e.g., to take advantage of density-dependent ant attraction) remains untested. We show that, as expected, the probability of treehopper oviposition increases with ant-presence and relative ant abundance. However, we also find that treehopper oviposition decreases with increasing treehopper density. Thus our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that treehopper aggregation is a socially cooperative strategy to attract ants; we suggest that aggregation is a form of conflict and an unavoidable by-product of individual responses to ant-tending levels.",2017

Emerging infectious diseases have risen to prominence due to their temporal correlation with colony losses. Among these is Deformed wing virus (DWV), which has been frequently linked to colony mortality. We now provide evidence of a strong statistical association between overwintering colony decline in the field and the presence of DWV genotype-B (DWV-B), a genetic variant of DWV that has recently been shown to be more virulent than the original DWV genotype-A. We link the prevalence of DWV-B directly to a quantitative measure of overwinter decline (workforce mortality) of honeybee colonies in the field. We demonstrate that increased prevalence of virus infection in individual bees is associated with higher overwinter mortality. We also observed a substantial reduction of infected colonies in the spring, suggesting that virus-infected individuals had died during the winter. Our findings demonstrate that DWV-B, plus possible A/B recombinants exhibiting DWV-B at PCR primer binding sites, may be a major cause of elevated overwinter honeybee loss. Its potential emergence in naive populations of bees may have far-reaching ecological and economic impacts.",2017

Although nectar is commonly stored in ecology, storage reliability and effectiveness have rarely been quantified. Inappropriate nectar storage between sampling and analysis can alter nectar chemistry as a result of enzyme or microbial action. Our review of the literature indicates that measures to preserve nectar sugars before analysis include refrigeration, freezing, the addition of an antimicrobial agent, spotting and drying on filter paper, the addition of a desiccant or a combination of these storage treatments. Nectar stored on filter paper is removed by washing with a solvent before analysis. Elution methods are often complex, not standardised and poorly reported in published work. Existing storage methods have generally been used without an evaluation of their impact on results, but evidence suggests a potentially large impact on result accuracy. Future studies should report storage treatments and elution methods to legitimise comparison among independent studies and provide unbiased evaluation of the results. In view of the wide range of storage methods used and lack of verification of their appropriateness, is imperative that standardised and effective methods be developed to ensure that results are reliable. We recommend the prompt analysis of nectar, detailed description of methods, including size of filter paper and method of elution, and use of sterile techniques.",2017

The ability to self-fertilise autonomously and to tolerate self-pollen was assessed in three bird-pollinated obligate seeder (E. densifolia, E. sessiliflora and E. discolor) and three insect-pollinated obligate seeder (E. penicilliformis, E. scabriscula and E. formosa) Erica species in the southern coastal part of the Cape Floristic Region. None of the species successfully reproduced through autogamy and only the bird-pollinated E. sessiliflora produced a significant proportion of viable seeds per fruit when selfed. With the other five Erica species examined, cross-pollination yielded a significantly higher proportion of viable seeds per fruit compared to other treatments (autogamy and self-pollination). This suggests that the role of pollinators is essential for the reproductive success of Erica regardless of their pollination system (bird- versus insect-pollination) and that most are out-crossers.",2017

(Fabaceae) in arid coastal areas of the Mediterranean basin,Apoidea; Bumblebees; Food paucity; Pollinator diversity; Wildflowers,SUBSP VULGARIS FABACEAE; BEES; ENHANCEMENT; HABITAT; DECLINE,"Abundance and diversity of insect pollinators are declining in many ecosystems worldwide. The abundance and diversity of wild and managed bees are related to the availability of continuous floral resources. In particular, in Mediterranean basin countries, the presence of wildflower spots enhances the establishment of social Apoidea, since coastal regions are usually characterized by pollen and nectar shortage in early spring and late summer. Anthyllis barba-jovis produces both nectar and pollen as important food source for bees helping them to overcome early spring period food shortage. We investigated flowering, seed set, and pollinator diversity of A. barba-jovis in arid coastal environments of the Mediterranean basin. Pollinator abundance reached a maximum in early April. Honeybees were the most common pollinators followed by bumblebees and solitary bees. Plants prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression with a strong decrease in seed-set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on pollination ecology of A. barba-jovis.",2017
Preference of an insular flying fox for seed figs enhances seed dispersal of a dioecious species,Chiroptera; dietary analysis; Ficus; frugivores; opposing selection; plant-animal interactions; Pteropodidae,PTEROPUS-DASYMALLUS-INOPINATUS; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; OKINAWA-JIMA ISLAND; OLD-WORLD TROPICS; FRUIT BATS; DELIBERATE INSECTIVORY; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; RYUKYU ARCHIPELAGO; SOUTHERN THAILAND; FEEDING ECOLOGY,"Interactions among multiple species form complex networks of interdependences and are considered primary factors in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Pteropodid bats are keystone species that provide important ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal in the tropics and subtropics. In this study, we investigated the utilization and preference of food resources by the insular frugivorous flying fox Pteropus dasymallus. We found that fig species constituted the major portion of the diet of the flying fox (94.6%). When foraging, the flying fox preferred seed figs from female trees over gall figs from male trees in functionally dioecious fig species. Germination experiments showed a significantly higher percentage of germination for fig seeds in feces than those from pellets and ripe figs (feces: 80.2%, pellets: 23.4%, ripe figs: 32.9%). Considering the active selection of seed figs and avoidance of gall figs by foraging flying foxes, we suggest that the abundance of seed figs accurately represents food availability for dioecy. This preference for seed figs or viable seeds can effectively promote the survival of pollinating wasps and might reinforce the evolution of dioecism in figs. In addition, the effects of gut passage on seed germination, in combination with the capacity of flying foxes to travel long distances, may substantially contribute to the efficiency of flying foxes as seed dispersers.",2017
Understanding intraspecific variation of floral scent in light of evolutionary ecology,Pollination; chemical ecology; intraspecific variation; evolution; reproductive strategies; odour,SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM; POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; SAMBUCINA L. SOO; HESPERIS-MATRONALIS; SILENE-LATIFOLIA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NOCTURNAL POLLINATION; VISITOR INTERACTIONS,"Background and Aims Among the various floral traits involved in pollinator attraction and potentially under selection mediated by pollinators, floral scent/fragrance has been less investigated than other components of floral phenotype. Whether or not pollinator-mediated selection impacts floral scents depends on the heritability of scent/fragrance and the occurrence of some variation within species. Although most studies have investigated how scent varies among species, growing amounts of data are available on variation at the intraspecific level. Methods The results of 81 studies investigating intraspecific variation of floral scents in 132 taxa were reviewed. For each study, whether variation was found in either identity, proportion or absolute quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was recorded, as well as information with the potential to explain variation, such as methodology, plant origin or pollination biology. Key Results Variation was found for almost all investigated species, both among individuals (among and sometimes within populations) and within individuals across different temporal scales. Cases in which such variation is a possible result of pollinator-mediated selection were analysed, by discussing separately selection related to variation in pollinator identity/behaviour among populations or across time, deceit pollination and sex-specific selection. Not surprisingly, in many cases, pollinator-mediated selection alone does not explain the observed variation in floral scent. This led us to review current knowledge on less investigated factors, such as selection mediated by natural enemies, genetic drift and gene flow, environmental constraints, phylogenetic inertia, or biochemical constraints that could be invoked to explain scent variation. Conclusions This review highlights the great potential of analysing floral scent variation and including it in integrated studies of floral phenotypes. We also have identified the current gaps in our understanding of this complex signal and we propose several methodological and conceptual future directions in this research area.",2017

Ramalina europaea, widely distributed in Europe, can be distinguished by small, punctiform, often terminal soralia starting out on small, spine-like branchlets, whereas R. labiosorediata from North America differs from R. pollinaria s. str. and R. europaea in the almost exclusively terminal soralia formed on the tips of normal lobes, originating from the underside and becoming irregularly labriform. Morphological characters, chemistry, ecology and geographical distribution are discussed and a key to the species of the Ramalina pollinaria group is provided. The topology of a maximum likelihood tree based on ITS shows the presence of three well-supported clades, corresponding to the morphological differences of the three species. The status of several historical names variously placed in synonymy with or described as infraspecific entities of R. pollinaria is reassessed and a new neotype and an epitype are designated for Lichen pollinarius, a neotype for L. squarrosus, making it a synonym of R. farinacea, and lectotypes for R. pollinaria var. elatior, making it a synonym of R. pollinaria s. str., and for var. humilis, a taxon of yet unknown affinity.",2017
Self-compatibility is over-represented on islands,Baker's law; biogeography; ecological filtering; island; mainland; self-incompatibility,LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; BAKERS LAW; OCEANIC ISLANDS; MATING SYSTEM; NEW-ZEALAND; POLLINATION; PLANTS; INCOMPATIBILITY; EVOLUTION; DIOECY,"Because establishing a new population often depends critically on finding mates, individuals capable of uniparental reproduction may have a colonization advantage. Accordingly, there should be an over-representation of colonizing species in which individuals can reproduce without a mate, particularly in isolated locales such as oceanic islands. Despite the intuitive appeal of this colonization filter hypothesis (known as Baker's law), more than six decades of analyses have yielded mixed findings. We assembled a dataset of island and mainland plant breeding systems, focusing on the presence or absence of self-incompatibility. Because this trait enforces outcrossing and is unlikely to re-evolve on short timescales if it is lost, breeding system is especially likely to reflect the colonization filter. We found significantly more self-compatible species on islands than mainlands across a sample of > 1500 species from three widely distributed flowering plant families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae). Overall, 66% of island species were self-compatible, compared with 41% of mainland species. Our results demonstrate that the presence or absence of self-incompatibility has strong explanatory power for plant geographical patterns. Island floras around the world thus reflect the role of a key reproductive trait in filtering potential colonizing species in these three plant families.",2017
Phenological shifts in hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae): linking measurement and mechanism,,GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; CENTRAL ENGLAND; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; RANGE SHIFTS; LONG-TERM; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; FLIES; CONSERVATION; BUTTERFLIES,"An understanding of ecological and evolutionary responses to global environmental change requires both a robust measurement of the change that is occurring and a mechanistic framework for understanding the drivers of that change. Such a requirement provides a challenge because biological monitoring is often ad hoc, and mechanistic experiments are often performed under highly simplified conditions. This study integrates multiple datasets to evaluate our current knowledge of the measurement and mechanism of phenological shifts in a key pollinator taxon: the hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae). First, two large, complementary and independent monitoring datasets are used to test for trends in phenology: an ad hoc national recording scheme containing. 620 000 records, and standardised monitoring with consistent methods over 30 yr. Results show that ad hoc and standardised recording data give quantitatively the same value for phenological advance in hoverflies (ca 12 d degrees C-1 on average at the beginning of the flight period), supporting the value of biological recording for the measurement of global ecological change. While the end of the flight period appears static in ad hoc recording, the standardised dataset suggests a similar advance as in the beginning of the flight period. Second, an extensive traits dataset and a novel database of laboratory-derived developmental data on Syrphidae (153 published studies) are used to test for mechanistic patterns in phenological shifts. The only species trait that influenced phenology was voltinism, where species with more generations per year exhibit stronger phenological advances. We demonstrate considerable variation in the laboratory-derived sensitivity to temperature but this does not match field-derived measures of phenology. The results demonstrate that, as for many taxa, we have a strong understanding of the patterns of global ecological change but that we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of those processes despite extensive research into the fundamental biology of some taxonomic groups.",2017

How a generalist bee achieves high efficiency of pollen collection on diverse floral resources,behavioral flexibility; floral sonication; floral evolution; learning; pollen foraging; specialization,BUMBLEBEES BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; BUZZ-POLLINATION; FLOWERS; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; BEHAVIOR; NECTAR; ADAPTATION; VISITORS,"Bees foraging for floral rewards are one of our most thoroughly studied examples of generalist foraging ecology. Generalist bees rely considerably on instrumental (associative) learning to acquire routines that allow them to collect nectar efficiently from diverse plant species. Although such bees must also collect pollen from diverse species, few studies have examined if and how high efficiency is achieved. We characterized how generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) foraged effectively for pollen from diverse floral resources, by manipulating the presence of pollen and anther cues, in a series of experiments using pollen-bearing live flowers, flowers of a sterile pollenless horticultural hybrid, and artificial flowers. We show that generalist bumble bees exhibit flexible and effective pollen collection by switching between 2 routines: ""scrabbling"" when pollen is abundant and ""sonicating"" when pollen is scarce. Efficient switching between these behaviors is regulated by the interplay of 2 ubiquitous floral cues: chemical anther cues stimulating pollen collection behavior and mechanical pollen cues suppressing sonication (and eliciting scrabbling). Flexible pollen collection behavior is functional: When pollen on anthers was scarce, bees collected it at a greater rate by sonicating than scrabbling. This mechanism of behavioral flexibility likely allows generalist bees to handle diverse anther morphologies efficiently and may have facilitated the recurrent evolution of plant species that conceal pollen rewards via pored floral morphology. Whereas effective nectar foraging relies heavily on associative learning of unique routines for each flower type, a weighing of 2 types of cues regulates the flexible pollen collection mechanism we describe.",2017
Forbidden versus permitted interactions: Disentangling processes from patterns in ecological network analysis,artificial life; co-occurrence; ecological networks; food web; functional traits; mutualism; nestedness; pollinators,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS; FOOD WEBS; SEGREGATION; POLLINATION,"Several studies have identified the tendency for species to share interacting partners as a key property to the functioning and stability of ecological networks. However, assessing this pattern has proved challenging in several regards, such as finding proper metrics to assess node overlap (sharing), and using robust null modeling to disentangle significance from randomness. Here, we bring attention to an additional, largely neglected challenge in assessing species' tendency to share interacting partners. In particular, we discuss and illustrate with two different case studies how identifying the set of permitted interactions for a given species (i.e. interactions that are not impeded, e.g. by lack of functional trait compatibility) is paramount to understand the ecological and co-evolutionary processes at the basis of node overlap and segregation patterns.",2017
"Effects of mast seeding and rodent abundance on seed predation and dispersal of Quercus aliena (Fagaceae) in Qinling Mountains, Central China",Quercus aliena; Mast seeding; Rodent abundance; Per capita seed availability; Seed dispersal; Seed caching,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; WIND POLLINATION; TREES; MAMMALS; FOREST; RECRUITMENT; ADVANTAGE; SYNCHRONY; FATE,"Rodents act as seed predators and dispersers and play an important role in the regeneration of plants. Seed production and rodent abundance may influence caching rodents' decision to consume or cache seeds. We studied how did seed production and rodent abundance co-influence seed predation and dispersal by rodents in the mast seed years (2011 and 2013) and non-mast seed years (2012 and 2014) in the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi Province, Central China. We found that: (1) The seed removal rates were much faster in the non-mast seed years than in the mast seed years. (2) Although the total number of seeds consumed (including eaten in situ and after removal) was higher in the non-mast seed years than in the mast seed years, no significant differences were found in the seeds that were eaten in situ and after removal among the 4 years. (3) Significant differences were observed in seeds that were cached among the 4 years, and more seeds were cached in the non-mast seed years than in the mast seed years. (4) The primary and secondary seed dispersal distances (including cached and eaten) were all longer in the non-mast seed years than in the mast seed years. Overall, these results indicate that non-mast seeding with low per capita seed availability could increase both seeds consumption and caching by rodents. Our results are partially supporting the predator satiation hypothesis.",2017
Colony adaptive response to simulated heat waves and consequences at the individual level in honeybees (Apis mellifera),,CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUPAL DEVELOPMENT; THERMAL ECOLOGY; IMMUNE FUNCTION; HARVESTER ANTS; BEE COLONIES; WORKER BEES; TEMPERATURE; STRESS; THERMOREGULATION,"Since climate change is expected to bring more severe and frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, assessing the physiological and behavioural sensitivity of organisms to temperature becomes a priority. We therefore investigated the responses of honeybees, an important insect pollinator, to simulated heat waves (SHW). Honeybees are known to maintain strict brood thermoregulation, but the consequences at the colony and individual levels remain poorly understood. For the first time, we quantified and modelled colony real-time activity and found a 70% increase in foraging activity with SHW, which was likely due to the recruitment of previously inactive bees. Pollen and nectar foraging was not impacted, but an increase in water foragers was observed at the expense of empty bees. Contrary to individual energetic resources, vitellogenin levels increased with SHW, probably to protect bees against oxidative stress. Finally, though immune functions were not altered, we observed a significant decrease in deformed wing virus loads with SHW. In conclusion, we demonstrated that honeybees could remarkably adapt to heat waves without a cost at the individual level and on resource flow. However, the recruitment of backup foraging forces might be costly by lowering the colony buffering capacity against additional environmental pressures.",2017
Why mistletoes are more aggregated in disturbed forests? The role of differential host mortality,Dromiciops gliroides; Plant-animal interactions; Plant -plant interactions; Point-pattern analysis; Spatial ecology; Tristerix corymbosus,MONTE DROMICIOPS-GLIROIDES; SEED-DISPERSAL; TEMPERATE MISTLETOE; PARASITIC PLANTS; BEHAVIOR; PATTERN; POLLINATION; SCALE; HETEROGENEITY; LORANTHACEAE,"Mistletoes rely on biotic seed dispersal to ensure their recruitment on appropriate host plants, as their seeds must be deposited on safe sites to allow attachment. As most host-parasite systems, mistletoe's spatial distribution depends on the spatial arrangement of the hosts and on the seed disperser's behavior. We used the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus, which is solely dispersed by the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, and it is capable to parasitize a wide range of hosts. We previously found T. corymbosus mistletoes to be more abundant and densely aggregated in disturbed habitats, compared to neigh-boring native forests, at similar levels of disperser abundance and host availability. To explain this pattern, we tested two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) the larger resource availability in disturbed habitats modify the disperser behavior reducing its home range, and (2) plant species in disturbed habitats are better hosts and offer higher survival probabilities. We sampled 300 mistletoes (98 at the native forest and 202 at the disturbed habitat), which were followed from November 2011 to March 2015 for estimating survival rates and conducting point-pattern analyses. Besides, we tracked ten Dromiciops gliroides individuals using VHF telemetry at both habitats to estimate the home range areas in the two habitats. Mistletoes were aggregated in both habitat types, being stronger at the disturbed habitat with dense plant clumps. Besides, no differences were found on home range of individual D. gliroides between habitats despite structural and resource availability differences. However, mistletoe survival significantly differed between habitats, as mistletoes had a survival probability of 82.87% at the disturbed habitat, whereas survival probability at the non-disturbed habitat was 53.33%. The most common host species at the non-disturbed habitat is Pluchea absinthioides, a seasonal shrub where mistletoes had a survival probability of 29%. At the disturbed habitat, however, the most common hosts are the shade-intolerant shrubs Aristotelia chilensis and Rhaphithamnus spinosus, which had very low mortality rates. The aggregation pattern found at the disturbed habitat is likely to emerge from differential host mortality rather than behavioral changes on the seed disperser vector.",2017
Earlier flowering did not alter pollen limitation in an early flowering shrub under short-term experimental warming,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SUB-ALPINE MEADOW; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; SEED SET; RESPONSES; GROWTH; FRUIT,"In animal pollinated plants, phenological shifts caused by climate change may have important ecological consequences. However, no empirical evidence exists at present on the consequences that flowering phenology shifts have on the strength of pollen limitation under experimental warming. Here, we investigated the effects of experimental warming on flowering phenology, flower density, reproductive success, and pollen limitation intensity in Caragana microphylla and evaluated whether earlier flowering phenology affected plant reproduction and the level of pollen limitation using warmed and unwarmed open top chambers in the Horqin Sandy Land of Inner Mongolia, northern China. The results of this study indicated that artificial warming markedly advanced flower phenology rather than extending the duration of the flowering. Additionally, warming was found to significantly reduce flower density which led to seed production reduction, since there were insignificant effects observed on fruit set and seed number per fruit. Experimental floral manipulations showed that warming did not affect pollen limitation. These results revealed the negative effects of advanced phenology induced by warming on flower density and reproductive output, as well as the neutral effects on reproductive success and pollen limitation intensity of long surviving plants.",2017
Nesting biology of two species of the large carpenter bees Xylocopa pubescens and Xylocopa fenestrata (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in north-western Pakistan,Large carpenter bees; pollinator; Poplar; Sesbania; foraging; North-western Pakistan,BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; ANTHOPHORIDAE,"The large carpenter bees are very promising pollinators for many agriculture crops. The nesting biology and some foraging activities of these large carpenter bees are documented from the north-western Pakistan, most extent of its natural distribution, as these species are potentially important pollinators of cucurbit crops and some agriculture crops in the region. Nests of the large carpenter bees, Xylocopa pubescens Spinola, 1838 and Xylocopa fenestrata Fabricius, 1798, around the Ismaila village, Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan, were observed and sampled from June to August 2012 and 2013. Nest details were recorded and foraging times on various floral species were documented, with bees preferentially nesting in dead wooden stems of Poplar (Populus deltoides) and Sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa). The dissection of nests was carried out and both nest architecture and nesting biology of the species were described. The importance of such studies on wild bees in Pakistan is important for the melittologists, as it will help in conservation of wild bees. The study is also useful in using large carpenter bees for pollination purpose.",2017

Forecasting potential emergence of zoonotic diseases in South-East Asia: network analysis identifies key rodent hosts,arenaviruses; centrality; disease ecology; habitat; helminths; modularity; network analysis; rodent-borne diseases; South-East Asia; synanthropy,POLLINATION NETWORKS; SMALL MAMMALS; HABITAT; SPP.; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; COMMUNITIES; PREVALENCE; CENTRALITY; AFRICA,"1. Within complex ecological systems, identifying animal species likely to play a key role in the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases remains a major challenge. One approach consists of using information on current ecological and parasitological similarities among host species in order to predict the most likely pathways for future pathogen spillover. 2. Using field data acquired from 15 sympatric rodent species in various habitats in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, we built networks based on shared parasites (17 helminth and 15 microparasite species) and shared habitats among rodent species and humans. We investigated the architectures of bipartite and unipartite networks using modularity, subgroups partitioning or node centrality, to assess the relative epidemiological importance of particular rodent species. 3. Our results showed that Rattus tanezumi, Bandicota savilei and R. exulans were consistently found to be members of subgroups that included humans in unipartite and bipartite networks on zoonotic agents and shared habitats. High values of centrality in shared zoonotic agents were found for the same three rodent species, whereas high values of shared habitats were observed for two of them. Although phylogenetically related rodent species likely shared both habitats and parasites, a lack of habitat specialization was associated with increased zoonotic parasite sharing. 4. Our results emphasize the disproportionate importance of these three rodent species, through their high degree of connectivity with humans, which may represent a high risk for direct zoonotic spillover. Moreover, due to its high centrality in habitats, R. tanezumi may also play a key role as a bridge host. 5. The recent discovery of new arenaviruses in rodents in South-East Asia, with associated disease in humans in Cambodia, provides an opportunity to test this empirically. The three rodent species identified using our network approach are some of the potential maintenance hosts for these new emerging arenaviruses. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results on rodents and their pathogens in South-East Asia show that network analysis has a high potential to improve the surveillance of emerging zoonotic pathogens by targeting key host species and potential 'emerging' pathogen-rodent interactions in complex and heterogeneous landscapes.",2017
Sex allocation in gynodioecious Cyananthus delavayi differs between gender morphs and soil quality,Cyananthus delavayi; Flower morphology; Gynodioecious species; Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains; Sex allocation; Soil quality,SHRUB HEBE-SUBALPINA; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; POLLINATOR VISITATION; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; FLOWERING PLANTS; SYSTEM EVOLUTION; FEMALE FREQUENCY; DIMORPHIC SHRUB; DIOECY,"Gynodioecy, where females and hermaphrodites coexist in the same natural population, is particularly suitable for predicting the ecological pressures that drive the stability of gender polymorphism. Since females have a disadvantage in that they only contribute to the next generation via ovules, they should gain an advantage via other means, of which resource allocation is an important component. Thus, to study their sex allocation is very helpful to understand how the dimorphic sexual system is maintained in natural systems. We studied the sex allocation patterns and reproductive output of the gynodioecious Cyananthus delavayi in three populations with different soil qualities (organic matter, N, P and K). The hermaphroditic flowers and pistils were much larger than those of female individuals. Although both gender morphs invested similar biomass in the pistils, females allocated more of their resource pool to the seed production, while hermaphrodites allocated more to pollinator advertisement. The pollen production of hermaphrodites did not differ between populations, suggesting that pollen production by hermaphrodites was not limited by soil nutrients. Fruit set of females, but not hermaphrodites, decreased with declining soil quality, whereas seeds per fruit of both females and hermaphrodites were highest in poor soils. Overall, this study shows that females achieve greater reproductive success by allocating more of their resource pool to enhancing seed production, which should favor their presence in gynodioecious populations. The hermaphrodites achieve reproductive success from both pollen and seed production, and unnecessarily reduce their allocation to pollen production. Soil quality should explain, at least partially, the sexual allocation patterns. Furthermore, some of our findings contradict previous hypotheses, thus adding a new example to the body of research on plant sex allocation and the development of future theories.",2017
The relative contributions of competition and abiotic tolerances in determining the geographical distributions of four closely relatedYuccaspecies in Texas,biodiversity; competition; geographical range limits; mutualism; niche compartmentalization; yucca,ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; YUCCA MOTHS; TEGETICULA-YUCCASELLA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; RANGE LIMITS; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION; COEVOLUTION; ENVIRONMENT; SPECIATION,"AimThe determinants of species' geographical ranges are the result of both abiotic and biotic factors. Among co-occurring closely related species, some degree of differentiation in niche characteristics is assumed necessary to allow continued coexistence. As niche requirements are likely to show similarity or overlap, competition among such species may also restrict range limits and help maintain species boundaries. We examined the roles of niche compartmentalization and competition to assess their relative contributions in determining geographical distributions of four closely related species of Yucca co-occurring across a large region of Texas. These species are pollinated by the same moth species, but each yucca is a distinct biological species. LocationTexas, USA. methods we used species distribution modelling and niche evaluation methods based on extensive field surveys to evaluate the roles of abiotic factors and competition. We also conducted surveys of flowering activity to determine if species boundaries may be maintained by species-specific shifts in flowering phenology that would limit interspecific gene flow. results niche evaluation methods demonstrate unique niches mostly consistent with the defined ecological regions of Texas. Geographical distributions of yuccas are mostly parapatric with some regions of sympatry. Species distribution models indicate that most species pairings display a region of potential sympatry where one of the species is numerically dominant, suggesting that competitive exclusion is delineating species ranges at parapatric margins. Flowering activity data indicate the potential for cross-pollination among these species. Nevertheless, there is little evidence for hybridization, suggesting that strong selection due to niche requirements is mediating species boundaries. Main conclusions results suggest that adaptation to abiotic conditions has been a major force underpinning diversification in these plants. However, competition at the edge of species' ranges likely limits the spread of any one species, leading to uncharacteristically high species diversity over a relatively small geographical area.",2017

Extensively used during the last two decades in weed science, trait-based approaches have provided general insights into weed community response to agricultural practices, and recently to understanding the effect of weeds on agro-ecosystem functioning. In this review, we provide a holistic synthesis of the current knowledge on weed response and effect functional traits. Based on the literature and recent advances in weed science, we review current knowledge on (i) weed functional groups and ecological strategies, (ii) weed functional response traits to cropping systems and (iii) weed functional effect traits affecting agro-ecosystem functioning. For each functional trait, we explicitly present the assumptions and evidence on the linkage between trait values and ecological functions, in response to either management practices, for example tillage, sowing and herbicides, or biotic interactions, for example crop-weed competition and pollination. Finally, we address and discuss major research avenues that may significantly improve the use of traits and the knowledge of functional diversity in weed science for the future, especially to design and implement more environmentally sustainable weed management strategies.",2017

We thus examined the relationships between floral morphology or biomass and phytohormones in male and female flowers of dioecious Populus cathayana populations along an altitudinal gradient (1,500, 1,600, and 1,700m above sea level) in the Xiaowutai Nature Reserve in northern China. The female and male flowers had the most stigma and pollen at 1,700m, the largest ovaries and least pollen at 1,500m, and the smallest ovaries and greater numbers of anthers at 1,600m altitude. The single-flower biomass was significantly greater in males than in females at 1,600 or 1,700m, but the opposite was true at 1,500m altitude. The biomass percentages were significantly higher in anthers than in stigmas at each altitude, while significantly greater gibberellin A3 (GA(3)), zeatin riboside (ZR), indoleacetic acid (IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations were found in female than in male flowers. Moreover, most flower morphological traits positively correlated with IAA in females but not in males. The biomass of a single flower was significantly positively correlated with ABA or IAA in males but negatively with ZR in females and was not correlated with GA(3) in both females and males. Our results demonstrate a distinct sexual adaptation between male and female flowers and that phytohormones are closely related to the size, shape, and biomass allocation in the pollination or fertilization organs of dioecious plants, although with variations in altitude.",2017
The role of disease in bee foraging ecology,,BUMBLE-BEE; HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; FLORAL PHYTOCHEMICALS; SELF-MEDICATION; PARASITE; POLLINATORS; PATHOGEN; TRANSMISSION; RESISTANCE,"Diseases have important but understudied effects on bee foraging ecology. Bees transmit and contract diseases on flowers, but floral traits including plant volatiles and inflorescence architecture may affect transmission. Diseases spill over from managed or invasive pollinators to native wild bee species, and impacts of emerging diseases are of particular concern, threatening pollinator populations and pollination services. Here we review how parasites can alter the foraging behaviour of bees by changing floral preferences and impairing foraging efficiency. We also consider how changes to pollinator behaviours alter or reduce pollination services. The availability of diverse floral resources can, however, ameliorate bee diseases and their impacts through better nutrition and antimicrobial effects of plant compounds in pollen and nectar.",2017

This is especially true facing climate change since genetic diversity and the spread of potentially beneficial alleles are important for the adaptability of populations. Therefore, knowledge about genetic variability within and between populations is a critical aspect when determining provenance regions. In our study, we investigated the population genetic structure of a widespread, insect-pollinated and mainly bird-dispersed shrub species, Frangula alnus, on the basis of seven microsatellites and two chloroplast DNA markers throughout Germany. The aim was to determine the spatial, temporal and ecological processes genetically structuring populations to critically revise existing provenance regions. Therefore, we conducted analyses on different spatial scales (country-wide, regional and local) using the two different marker sets in addition to environmental variables. We detected distinct patterns on all spatial scales which indicated influences of historic recolonization processes, regional differences of seed dispersal across the landscape, as well as small-scale spatial genetic structures attributable to local dispersal processes. No relation of underlying environmental gradients such as temperature or precipitation and genetic patterns was found. We conclude that different aspects of historic and more recent gene flow shape population genetic structures and that a thorough analysis on a variety of spatial, temporal and environmental scales is necessary to appropriately select planting material for conservation and restoration measures. Correspondingly, management advice regarding provenance delineations will be provided.",2017
Division of labor of anthers in heterantherous plants: flexibility of bee pollen collection behavior may serve to keep plants honest,Heteranthery; Pollen collection; Floral sonication; Behavioral plasticity; Buzz pollination; Bumble bee,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; SOLANACEAE; SONICATION; STAMENS; BUZZ,"Heteranthery is thought to reflect a division of labor, with some anthers serving a pollinator-feeding function and others serving a pollinating function. Mutualism theory predicts that each participant should try to maximize the benefit it receives from its partner: plants should allocate more pollen to pollination, and pollinators should collect more pollen. Accordingly, plant and pollinator may engage in a 'tug of war' with respect to pollen from each anther type, resulting in incomplete division of labor. Here, we explored this idea by conducting a fully factorial manipulation of the availability of pollen in long and short anthers of staminate flowers of Solanum houstonii. We found the following: (1) Bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) preferred to sonicate (collect pollen from) short anthers over long anthers, consistent with a role as feeding and pollinating anthers, respectively; (2) Blocking short anther pores alone increased sonication of long anthers and resulted in collection of pollen from long anthers; (3) Blocking long anther pores alone did not influence sonication of short anthers; (4) The increase in sonication of long anthers, when short anther pores are blocked, was greater when pollen was available in long anthers; (5) Despite shifting sonication effort to long anthers, bees do not move their bodies closer to long anther pores where pollen could be collected more effectively; and (6) analysis of the growth of corbicular loads over time spent buzzing indicates that significant amounts of pollen are collected from long anthers as well as short anthers. We conclude that bees can flexibly increase pollen collection from pollinating anthers, but are constrained from fully exploiting this pollen. This results in checks and balances between plant and bee that may help maintain heteranthery.",2017

Although response to climate change could have been modulated by mutualistic interactions with other species, studies exploring the dynamics of these interactions and their role facilitating species persistence during past climatic variations are scarce. In this work, we attempt to explore the spatial dynamic of Calceolaria polyrhiza and its oil-collecting bee pollinators during the last 120,000 years, identifying stable areas of persistence and statistically determining whether the distribution of pollinator-related floral ecotypes is associated with these shared areas of persistence. To do this, we used 395 presence records of the interacting species and constructed species palaeodistribution models. Additionally, we gathered phenotypic measures of the plant and used decision tree and multiple regression analyses to link the plant phenotypic divergence with the distribution of stable areas. Our species distribution models suggest that past climatic changes affected the interaction between C. polyrhiza and both bee species in time and space. While the interaction between the plant and C. caeruleus predominated in the Andean-Patagonian forest and was relatively stable in space and time, that was not the case for the pollinator C. cineraria in the Patagonian steppe. This, along with our analyses of spatial phenotypic divergence, indicates that current floral phenotypes are the result of two historical different pollination regimes.",2017

Recent evidence indicates that constitutive antiherbivore defences can alter natural selection on reproductive traits, but it is unclear whether induced defences will have the same effect and whether reduced foliar damage in defended plants is the cause of this pattern. In a factorial field experiment using common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca L., we induced plant defences using jasmonic acid (JA) and imposed foliar damage using scissors. We found that JA-induced plants experienced selection for more inflorescences that were smaller in size (fewer flowers), whereas control plants only experienced a trend towards selection for larger inflorescences (more flowers); all effects were independent of foliar damage. Our results demonstrate that induced defences can alter both the strength and direction of selection on reproductive traits, and suggest that antiherbivore defences may promote the evolution of plant reproductive diversity.",2017
Deconstructing pollinator community effectiveness,,MIXED POLLEN SAMPLES; FRUIT-SET; FLOWER CONSTANCY; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BEE POLLINATORS; SEED PRODUCTION; CROP; PLANTS; DIVERSITY,"Effective pollination is a complex, context-dependent phenomenon determined by both species-level and community-level factors. While pollinator communities are constituted by interacting organisms in a shared environment, these factors are often simplified or overlooked when quantifying species-level pollinator effectiveness alone. Here, we review the recent literature on pollinator effectiveness to identify the pros and cons of existing methods and outline three important areas for future research: plant-pollinator interactions, heterospecific pollen transfer and variation in pollination outcomes. We conclude that pollinator community effectiveness needs to be acknowledged as a key property of pollination effectiveness in order to fully account for the suite of plant, pollinator and environmental factors known to influence different stages of successful pollination.",2017

Here, we review recent insights that have improved our mechanistic understanding of how floral resources shape bee populations and pollination services.

Throughout our review, we take a mechanistic, multi-scalar approach that highlights the complexity of interactions between floral resources and bees, across space and time.",2017
Mutualistic strategies minimize coextinction in plant-disperser networks,defaunation; ecological networks; global change; mutualism; plant - animal interactions; seed dispersal,DISENTANGLING NESTEDNESS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SEED-DISPERSAL; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; ROBUSTNESS; FOREST; MASS; SPECIALIZATION,"The global decline of mutualists such as pollinators and seed dispersers may cause negative direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity. Mutualistic network models used to understand the stability of mutualistic systems indicate that species with low partner diversity are most vulnerable to coextinction following mutualism disruption. However, existing models have not considered how species vary in their dependence on mutualistic interactions for reproduction or survival, overlooking the potential influence of this variation on species' coextinction vulnerability and on network stability. Using global databases and field experiments focused on the seed dispersal mutualism, we found that plants and animals that depend heavily on mutualistic interactions have higher partner diversity. Under simulated network disruption, this empirical relationship strongly reduced coextinction because the species most likely to lose mutualists depend least on their mutualists. The pattern also reduced the importance of network structure for stability; nested network structure had little effect on coextinction after simulations incorporated the empirically derived relationship between partner diversity and mutualistic dependence. Our results highlight a previously unknown source of stability in mutualistic networks and suggest that differences among species in their mutualistic strategy, rather than network structure, primarily accounts for stability in mutualistic communities.",2017

The predicted niche occupancy profiles were matched with the outcomes of previous phylogenetic studies to reconstruct the evolution of climatic suitability within the orchid group studied and evaluate the role of niche differentiation in the speciation of Angraecinae. No correlation between preferred niches and taxonomic relationships within the orchid group studied was revealed. The climatic suitability of the majority of the species overlapped each other, either fully or partially. This pattern is also present in the species of other orchid genera. Our research confirms a significant level of PNC in Orchidaceae, even within taxa exhibiting a transatlantic disjunction. The analysis of the evolution of climatic suitability indicated that the adaptation to various climatic conditions is not a factor that has driven speciation within orchids studied.",2017

Although woodpeckers are important as primary cavity excavators and nuisance animals, published work on their visual systems is limited. We developed a novel foraging-based behavioral assay designed to test UV sensitivity in the Pileated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). We acdimated 21 wild-caught woodpeckers to foraging for frozen mealworms within 12 m sections of peeled cedar (Thuja spp.) poles. We then tested the functional significance of UV cues by placing frozen mealworms behind UV-reflective covers, UV-absorptive covers, or decayed red pine substrates within the same 1.2 m poles in independent experiments. Behavioral responses were greater toward both UV-reflective and UV-absorptive substrates in three experiments. Study subjects therefore reliably differentiated and attended to two distinct UV conditions of a foraging substrate. Cue-na ve subjects showed a preference for UV-absorptive substrates, suggesting that woodpeckers may be pre-disposed to foraging from such substrates. Behavioral responses were greater toward decayed pine substrates (UV-reflective) than sound pine substrates suggesting that decayed pine can be a useful foraging cue. The finding that cue-na ve subjects selected UV-absorbing foraging substrates has implications for ecological interactions of woodpeckers with fungi. Woodpeckers transport fungal spores, and communication methods analogous to those of plant-pollinator mutualisms (i.e. UV-absorbing patterns) may have evolved to support woodpecker-fungus mutualisms.

No single cause of honey bee collapse has yet to be identified, although pesticides, mites and other pathogens have all been shown to have a sublethal effect. We present a model of a functioning bee hive and introduce external stress to investigate the impact on the regulatory processes of recruitment to the forager class, social inhibition and the laying rate of the queen. The model predicts that constant density-dependent stress acting through an Allee effect on the hive can result in sudden catastrophic switches in dynamical behaviour and the eventual collapse of the hive. The model proposes that around a critical point the hive undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation, and that a small increase in model parameters can have irreversible consequences for the entire hive. We predict that increased stress levels can be counteracted by a higher laying rate of the queen, lower levels of forager recruitment or lower levels of natural mortality of foragers, and that increasing social inhibition can not maintain the colony under high levels of stress. We lay the theoretical foundation for sudden honey bee collapse in order to facilitate further experimental and theoretical consideration.",2017
Nectar sugars and amino acids in day- and night-flowering Nicotiana species are more strongly shaped by pollinators' preferences than organic acids and inorganic ions,,SECONDARY METABOLITES; ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS; FLORAL NECTARS; TREE TOBACCO; PLANT; SOLANACEAE; BIRDS; HUMMINGBIRDS; TEMPERATURE; SECRETION,"Floral nectar contains mainly sugars but also amino acids, organic acids, inorganic ions and secondary compounds to attract pollinators. The genus Nicotiana exhibits great diversity among species in floral morphology, flowering time, nectar compositions, and predominant pollinators. We studied nectar samples of 20 Nicotiana species, composed equally of day-and night-flowering plants and attracting different groups of pollinators (e.g. hummingbirds, moths or bats) to investigate whether sugars, amino acids, organic acids and inorganic ions are influenced by pollinator preferences. Glucose, fructose and sucrose were the only sugars found in the nectar of all examined species. Sugar concentration of the nectar of day-flowering species was 20% higher and amino acid concentration was 2-3-fold higher compared to the nectar of night-flowering species. The sucrose-to-hexose ratio was significantly higher in night-flowering species and the relative share of sucrose based on the total sugar correlated with the flower tube length in the nocturnal species. Flowers of different tobacco species contained varying volumes of nectar which led to about 150-fold higher amounts of total sugar per flower in bat-or sunbird-pollinated species than in bee-pollinated or autogamous species. This difference was even higher for total amino acids per flower (up to 1000-fold). As a consequence, some Nicotiana species invest large amounts of organic nitrogen for certain pollinators. Higher concentrations of inorganic ions, predominantly anions, were found in nectar of night-flowering species. Therefore, higher anion concentrations were also associated with pollinator types active at night. Malate, the main organic acid, was present in all nectar samples but the concentration was not correlated with pollinator type. In conclusion, statistical analyses revealed that pollinator types have a stronger effect on nectar composition than phylogenetic relations. In this context, nectar sugars and amino acids are more strongly correlated with the preferences of predominant pollinators than organic acids and inorganic ions.",2017

This shoreward drift, which is observed to be up to 75% of the RMS above-canopy orbital velocity, can have a significant impact on residence times within coastal canopies. There have been limited observations of this current and an accurate formulation of its magnitude is still lacking. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a practical relationship to describe the strength of this current as a function of both wave and canopy characteristics. A simple model for the Lagrangian drift velocity indicates that the magnitude of the wave-driven current increases with the above-canopy oscillatory velocity, the vertical orbital excursion at the top of the canopy, and the canopy density. An extensive laboratory study, using both rigid and (dynamically scaled) flexible model vegetation, was carried out to evaluate the proposed model. Experimental results reveal a strong agreement between predicted and measured current velocities over a wide and realistic range of canopy and wave conditions. The validity of this model is also confirmed through available field measurements. Characterization of this wave-induced mean current will allow an enhanced capacity for predicting residence time, and thus key ecological processes, in coastal canopies.",2017

Their chromatic and shape evolution, to attract pollinators, is the key to their dual benefit in terms of aesthetics and environmental functionality. Their scarcity and/or disappearance in conventional agro-ecosystems have led them to be considered as necessary for the restoration of the agro-environment. We compared the dynamics of wildflower-only and wildflower-weed communities, in outdoor boxes, in order to study the floristic evolution over the course of a three-year experiment. Four agronomic treatments were applied: seeding time, late winter cutting, summer harrowing, summer cutting after senescence. Our hypothesis was that the sustainability of the wildflower community was vulnerable to strong weed interference and that agronomic management is necessary for the long-term survival of wildflowers. The indicators used were: biomass, number of seeds in the seed bank, diversity indexes. Our results showed that the growth of the wildflowers was affected by the weeds, in terms of the biomass and seed bank accumulated. However, various agronomic disturbances, such as cutting and, to a greater extent, harrowing, maintained the balance of the floristic complexity in the wildflower-weed community. The plant equilibrium was confirmed by the Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes. We found that long-term wildflower sustainability is closely linked to the agronomic management. Further studies are needed to optimize the anthropic-dependent survival of such wildflower buffer areas, given the ""greening"" measures encouraged by the new European agricultural policy aimed at biodiversity conservation.

Sexual Deception in the Eucera-Pollinated Ophrys leochroma: A Chemical Intermediate between Wasp- and Andrena-Pollinated Species,Sexually deceptive orchid Ophrys leochroma; Long-horned bee Eucera kullenbergi; Chemical mimicry; Pollinator shift; Medium polar and non-polar compounds,FLORAL ODOR CHEMISTRY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ORCHID POLLINATION; IMPERFECT MIMICRY; DRIVEN SPECIATION; GENUS OPHRYS; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; ECOLOGY; PERSPECTIVES,"Ophrys flowers mimic sex pheromones of attractive females of their pollinators and attract males, which attempt to copulate with the flower and thereby pollinate it. Virgin females and orchid flowers are known to use the same chemical compounds in order to attract males. The composition of the sex pheromone and its floral analogue, however, vary between pollinator genera. Wasp-pollinated Ophrys species attract their pollinators by using polar hydroxy acids, whereas Andrena-pollinated species use a mixture of non-polar hydrocarbons. The phylogeny of Ophrys shows that its evolution was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator groups: from wasps to Eucera and consequently to Andrena and other bees. To gain further insights, we studied pollinator attraction in O. leochroma in the context of intra- and inter-generic pollinator shifts, radiation, and diversification in the genus Ophrys. Our model species, O. leochroma, is pollinated by Eucera kullenbergi males and lies in the phylogeny between the wasp and Andrena-pollinated species; therefore, it is a remarkable point to understand pollinator shifts. We collected surface extracts of attractive E. kullenbergi females and labellum extracts of O. leochroma and analyzed them by using gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We also performed field bioassays. Our results show that O. leochroma mimics the sex pheromone of its pollinator's female by using aldehydes, alcohols, fatty acids, and non-polar compounds (hydrocarbons). Therefore, in terms of the chemistry of pollinator attraction, Eucera-pollinated Ophrys species might represent an intermediate stage between wasp- and Andrena-pollinated orchid species.",2017

This should result in the pollination success of floral mimics being dependent on the relative abundance of their models, as pollinator abundance and conditioning on model signals should be higher in the vicinity of the models. However, the attraction of pollinators to signals of the models may be partially innate, such that spatial isolation of mimics from model species may not strongly affect pollination success of mimics. We tested whether pollination rates and fruit set of the rewardless orchid Disa pulchra were influenced by proximity and abundance of its rewarding model species, Watsonia lepida. Pollination success of the orchid increased with proximity to the model species, while fruit set of the orchid increased with local abundance of the model species. Orchids that were experimentally translocated outside the model population experienced reduced pollinaria removal and increased pollinator-mediated self-pollination. These results confirm predictions that the pollination success of floral mimics should be dependent on the proximity and abundance of model taxa, and thus highlight the importance of ecological facilitation among species involved in mimicry systems.",2017
Mapping species distributions with social media geo-tagged images: Case studies of bees and flowering plants in Australia,Bib-diversity data; Social network sites; Geo-tagged images; Species distribution mapping,POLLINATORS,"Data sources on species distribution and range are typically expensive and time consuming to build, and traditional survey techniques often have spatial, temporal, or scale-related gaps. Social network sites, on the other hand, can provide massive amounts of cost effective data that may potentially yield information of direct benefit to supplement and understand ecological phenomena. Previous research explored using social network site content to enhance information collected by experts or professional surveys in domains including species distribution and land cover. However, the data quality and general suitability of social network sites data for answering questions related to species distribution and range is highly variable and this aspect of its value to science remains underexplored. In this research we investigate some causes of social network site data unreliability and explore how to mitigate them. We filter data points based on our estimates of reliability and relevance. We then use the filtered data to infer species ranges and distributions in concert with Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data. Our proposed methodology was applied to four Australian case studies including two insect pollinators, and two flowering plants. The case studies were chosen from Australia because of its unique geographical features, large landmass, sparse population, and the many tourists and residents who travel across it taking photos and sharing them through social media. We show that, despite some barriers, there are instances where the social network site data clearly complement the existing source, making our technique a valuable means of making repeatable, efficient additions to traditional species distribution data.

Pollination services in cacao farms can be enhanced through efforts to conserve pollinator habitats, such as adding cacao fruit husks underneath trees to provide habitat and food resources for midge pollinators. However, it remains unclear how this habitat manipulation affects pest densities or biological control. Here, we evaluated the effects of the predaceous ant Oecophylla smaragdina on three major pests of Australian cacao (Helopeltis spp., Amblypelta spp., and Rhyparida nitida) in an Australian cacao farm, in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. We also evaluated the effect of O.smaragdina on their potentially plant-damaging, mutualistic mealybug (Pseudococcidae) partners in the presence and absence of cacao fruit husks. Oecophylla smaragdina reduced the combined densities of Helopeltis spp. and Amblypelta spp., regardless of cacao fruit husk addition. The ants also reduced the densities of R.nitida in the absence of cacao fruit husks, but R.nitida densities were naturally low in the experimental plots that received the addition of cacao fruit husks, regardless of ant presence. In contrast, ants generally increased the densities of mealybugs. These data suggest that O.smaragdina ants provide pest control services for three major insect pests in Australian cacao farms. Furthermore, this control may be compatible with habitat manipulations (i.e., the addition of cacao fruit husks) to improve pollinator habitat.",2017

Unfortunately, native bees are declining in abundance and diversity. Much of this decline comes from human landuse change. While the effects of large-scale agriculture on native bees are relatively well understood, the effects of urban development are less clear. Understanding urbanity's effect on native bees requires consideration of specific characteristics of both particular bee species and their urban landscape. We surveyed bumble-bee (Bombus spp.) abundance and diversity in gardens across multiple urban centres in southeastern Michigan. There are significant declines in Bombus abundance and diversity associated with urban development when measured on scales in-line with Bombus flight ability. These declines are entirely driven by declines in females; males showed no response to urbanization. We hypothesize that this is owing to differing foraging strategies between the sexes, and it suggests reduced Bombus colony density in more urban areas. While urbanity reduced Bombus prevalence, results in Detroit imply that 'shrinking cities' potentially offer unique urban paradigms that must be considered when studying wild bee ecology. Results show previously unidentified differences in the effects of urbanity on female and male bumble-bee populations and suggest that urban landscapes can be managed to support native bee conservation.",2017

While some species remain abundant and widespread, others have experienced vast declines. We tested if diet breadth and exclusiveness of floral resource use affected abundance and land-use response of bumblebees and honeybees in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Based on an ecological niche modelling approach, we discovered that three of 13 species (12 Bombus spp. and A. mellifera) responded negatively to land use, while no species responded positively. Overall abundance as well as land-use response of different bee species was unrelated to resource use. The generalist forager B. lapidarius, the slightly more specialised forager B. terrestris/lucorum species complex and the specialist forager B. wurflenii declined most with land use. Moreover, we found that honeybees and two bumblebee species contained higher levels of nitrogen than other non-predatory Hymenoptera and performed almost perfect homeostasis despite variable nitrogen contents of floral resources. We conclude that at least common species of social bees have good nitrogen homeostasis capacity. Generally, our data do not support the notion that species with more specialised floral resource use are more likely to suffer from land use.",2017

In this paper, I examine the best practises in nest box material selection and construction, and the use of nest boxes to address four basic objectives related to our understanding of bee biology and enhancement of pollination services. A variety of materials and cavity dimensions are included in nest boxes that are used to monitor local bee diversity or to address fundamental questions in community ecology and environmental change. Others examine bee biology, physiology and behaviour that use nest boxes to obtain bees for further experimentation. The majority of studies use nest boxes in agricultural landscapes and in alternative pollinator management; these studies improve nest box design for target bee species to augment their numbers.

We classified publications according to several attributes such as services and benefits derived from wild bees, types of bee-human interactions, recipients of direct benefits, social contexts where wild bees are found, and sources of changes to the bee-human system. We found that most of the services and benefits from wild bees are related to food, medicine, and pollination. We also found that wild bees directly provide benefits to communities to a greater extent than individuals. In the social contexts where they are found, wild bees occupy a central role.

In plant-animal mutualisms it is widely accepted that the total effect of a mutualist on its partner is estimated as (1) a 'quantity' component multiplied by (2) a 'quality' component, although the meanings of 'effectiveness,' 'quantity,' and 'quality' and which terms are applied to these metrics vary greatly across studies. In addition, a similar quantity x quality = total effect approach has not been applied to other types of mutualisms, although it could be informative. Lastly, when a total effect approach has been applied, it has invariably been from a phytocentric perspective, focussing on the effects of animal mutualists on their plant partner. This lack of a common framework of 'effectiveness' of mutualistic interactions limits generalisation and the development of a broader understanding of the ecology and evolution of mutualisms. In this paper, we propose a general framework and demonstrate its utility by applying it to both partners in five different types of mutualisms: pollination, seed dispersal, plant protection, rhizobial, and mycorrhizal mutualisms. We then briefly discuss the flexibility of the framework, potential limitations, and relationship to other approaches.",2017
Knoxdaviesia capensis: dispersal ecology and population genetics of a flower-associated fungus,Dispersal; Fynbos; Genetic diversity; Infructescences; Knoxdaviesia; Microsatellites; Ophiostomatoid; Pollination; Protea; Sympatry,MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; SOUTH-AFRICA; PROTEA-INFRUCTESCENCES; FLORISTIC REGION; DIVERSITY; OPHIOSTOMA; NICHE; GENUS; INFLORESCENCE; GONDWANAMYCES,"Protea-associated fungi are dispersed between flower heads by mites, beetles and possibly birds. For the ophiostomatoid fungus, Knoxdaviesia proteae, these vectors offer regular dispersal between distant floral hosts. Unlike K. proteae, Knoxdaviesia capensis occupies multiple Protea host species. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the generalist K. capensis shares the long-distance dispersal pattern with specialist K. proteae and whether it moves freely between different host species. We evaluated the genetic structure of K. capensis from five populations of a wide-spread host and between sympatric hosts. Twelve K. capensis-specific microsatellite markers were developed and applied to 90 individuals. K. capensis showed high genetic diversity and almost maximal genotypic diversity. All populations were poorly differentiated, indicating the presence of long-distance dispersal. No differentiation could be detected between sympatric host populations, suggesting free dispersal between different hosts. This implies that the beetle and bird vectors that pollinate Protea species show the same non-specific movement. ",2017
Network analysis of phenological units to detect important species in plant-pollinator assemblages: can it inform conservation strategies?,Community analysis; Connectance; Ecological network; Grassland; Habitat management; Hub; Modularity; Nestedness; Phenology; Pollination,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY; NESTEDNESS; ROBUSTNESS; MODULARITY; CENTRALITY; PATTERNS; GRADIENT,"Conservation of species is often focused either only on those that are endangered, or on maximising the number recorded on species lists. However, species share space and time with others, thus interacting and building frameworks of relationships that can be unravelled by community-level network analysis. It is these relationships that ultimately drive ecosystem function via the transfer of energy and nutrients. However interactions are rarely considered in conservation planning. Network analysis can be used to detect key species (""hubs"") that play an important role in cohesiveness of networks. We applied this approach to plant-pollinator communities on two montane Northern Apennine grasslands, paying special attention to the modules and the identity of hubs. We performed season-wide sampling and then focused the network analyses on time units consistent with plant phenology. After testing for significance of modules, only some modules were found to be significantly segregated from others. Thus, networks were organized around a structured core of modules with a set of companion species that were not organized into compartments. Using a network approach we obtained a list of important plant and pollinator species, including three Network Hubs of utmost importance, and other hubs of particular biogeographical interest. By having a lot of links and high partner diversity, hubs should convey stability to networks. Due to their role in the networks, taking into account such key species when considering the management of sites could help to preserve the greatest number of interactions and thus support many other species.",2017
Distribution patterns of the cold adapted bumblebee Bombus alpinus in the Alps and hints of an uphill shift (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Apidae),Climate change; Specialist; Rare species; Species distribution modelling; Altitudinal shift; Conservation,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; RANGE SHIFTS; HABITAT USE; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; DECLINE; EXTINCTIONS; POPULATION; ELEVATION,"Climate change is threatening species and habitats. Altitudinal shifts uphill and negative population trends are commonly observed in altitude-related taxa. The bumblebee Bombus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758) has a disjoint distribution restricted to Fennoscandia and the Alps, and is considered threatened. We studied the ecology and distribution of B. alpinus in the Alps, where the endemic subspecies Bombus alpinus helleri Dalla Torre 1882 is found, as a case-model because of its rarity, habitat, and mutual dependence with the ecosystem for pollination and resources. We developed species distribution models including both climatic and habitat variables to obtain the surface suitable for this subspecies and quantified its protected portion. Our analyses indicate that this bumblebee is restricted to the upper altitudes and has a narrow niche mainly related to the presence of glaciers, the cool temperature, a low temperature variation, and a specific range of precipitation. A strong altitudinal shift is also taking place probably due to climate change. After years of no changes in altitudinal distribution, its lowest altitudinal limit has moved up 479 m since the year 1984, while its upper altitudinal limit has remained unchanged. Over half of the suitable area in the Alps is included within protected areas, but conservation has not been planned yet. However, rare species with narrow niche, such as B. alpinus, are highly threatened by climate change. Potential short-term mitigation actions are discussed, including exchange of males between locations and integral protection of prairies in the vicinity of glaciers.",2017

This duality can be analyzed with the concept of ecosystem service. We reviewed the literature on orchards to explain how ecological functions modified by agricultural practices provide six ecosystem services - fruit production, climate regulation, soil nitrogen availability, water regulation, pest and disease control, and pollination - and which indicators could describe them. The major points are, first, that orchards have a high potential of multiple services. They can sequester from 2.4 to 12.5 t C/ha/year. Their perennial character and multi-strata habitat, as well as the opportunity of creating diversified hedgerows and cover crops in alleys, may contribute to a high level of biodiversity and related services. Second, every service depends on many functions. Fruit yield, which could reach up to 140 t/ha in apple orchards, is increased by light interception, carbon allocation, and nitrogen and water uptake. Third, agricultural practices in orchards have a strong impact on ecosystem functions and, consequently, on ecosystem services. Overfertilization enhances nitrogen leaching, which reduces soil nitrogen availability for the plant and deteriorates the quality of drained water. Groundcover increases humification and reduces denitrification and runoff, thus enhancing soil nitrogen availability and water regulation. It also enhances biotic interactions responsible for pest control and pollination. Pruning may increase fruit quality trough a better carbon allocation but decreases pest control by fostering the dynamics of aphids. To study multiple ecosystem services in orchards, we suggest using models capable of simulating service profiles and their variation according to management scenarios. We then refer to the available literature to show that conflicts between provisioning and regulating services can be mitigated by agricultural practices. Improved knowledge of soil processes and carbon balance as well as new models that address multiple services are necessary to foster research on ecosystem service relationships in orchards.",2017

As part of the Hardwood Genomics project (http://www.hardwoodgenomics.org/), we evaluated the utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) for framework genetic linkage map construction in honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), a leguminous tree common in eastern North America. Starting with a large open-pollinated family of progeny from a single tree, a mapping pedigree of 92 putative full-sibs was identified by kin group assignment and paternity analyses with microsatellite markers. RAD-Seq using Illumina next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) generated over 117 M reads among the 92 plants. De novo reference genome clustering and alignment of samples to the reference genome revealed 5849 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 1570 were retained after quality filtering. Of the 1570 SNPs, 236 were in pseudo-testcross mapping configuration in the maternal parent and segregated approximately in the expected 1: 1 ratio. The final map generated has a total length of 815.57 cM and consists of 178 markers on 14 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number in honey locust. Synteny and collinearity between honey locust and model legumes Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, and Phaseolus vulgaris were found for six of the honey locust linkage groups. RAD-Seq proved to be useful for framework linkage map construction in honey locust, a species for which no genomic resources had previously been available. However, greater sequence coverage and larger full-sib mapping pedigrees are necessary for the development of high-density linkage maps with future applications in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.",2017
Architecture of attractor determines dynamics on mutualistic complex networks,Mutualistic complex networks; Global attractor; Morse decomposition; Global stability,GRADIENT SEMIGROUPS; BIODIVERSITY; SYSTEM,"A mathematical system of differential equations for the modelization of mutualistic networks in Ecology has been proposed in Bastolla et al. (2007). Basically, it is studied how the complex structure of cooperation interactions between groups of plants and pollinators or seed dispersals affects to the whole network. In this paper we prove existence and characterization of the global attractor associated to the model. The description of the geometrical internal structure of the attractor becomes the proper complex network describing all the possible future scenarios of the phenomena. The arguments show a Morse Decomposition of the attractors, leading to the existence of a global Lyapunov function for the associated gradient semigroup. In particular, we are able to prove topological structural stability of the system, i.e., the associated attracting complex networks are robust under (autonomous and non-autonomous) perturbation of parameters.

They show a striking diversity of structural and behavioral adaptations and are important pollinators of tropical plants. Despite their diversity and functional importance, their ecology, and especially chemical ecology, has received relatively little attention, particularly compared to their relative the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Here, I review various aspects of the chemical ecology of stingless bees, from communication over resource allocation to defense. I list examples in which functions of specific compounds (or compound groups) have been demonstrated by behavioral experiments, and show that many aspects (e.g., queen-worker interactions, host-parasite interactions, neuronal processing etc.) remain little studied. This review further reveals that the vast majority of studies on the chemical ecology of stingless bees have been conducted in the New World, whereas studies on Old World stingless bees are still comparatively rare. Given the diversity of species, behaviors and, apparently, chemical compounds used, I suggest that stingless bees provide an ideal subject for studying how functional context and the need for species specificity may interact to shape pheromone diversification in social insects.",2017
What's That Buzzing Noise? Public Opinion on the Use of Drones for Conservation Science,attitudes towards science; conservation; polarization; public opinion; unmanned aerial vehicles,AERIAL-PHOTOGRAPHY; MANAGEMENT,"There is rapidly growing interest among scientists and practitioners in using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, to gather ecological data crucial for the effective conservation and management of natural resources. Public acceptance and support of drone use for conservation will play an important role in shaping the local-level regulatory landscape in the near future, either promoting or derailing the use of drones for this purpose. Here, we report the findings of the first public polling conducted on the use of drones for conservation efforts. We find moderate to strong public support for using drones for conservation among Americans but differing levels of support for other domestic uses. Demographic factors are not predictive of public support; rather, positive beliefs about science and egalitarian worldviews are associated with increasing support. The results highlight the importance of proactively engaging the public on this issue and avoiding antagonistic messages or cues that may activate ideologically driven opposition.",2017

We sampled Grevillea paradoxa and Melaleuca nematophylla across the species' ranges throughout the Transitional Rainfall Zone and extending slightly into the Arid Zone of southwest Western Australia. Both species exhibited range-wide phylogeographic and contemporary genetic structure. Moderate haplotype diversity centred in populations on Banded Ironstone Formation (BIF) outcrops and within the Murchison River gorge supports a hypothesis of historical persistence and evolution in these mesic refugia. These features are likely to play important roles in evolutionary persistence with ongoing climate change. There was little evidence of particularly complex demographic histories for the region. More limited haplotype diversity, as well as more limited nuclear genetic diversity and connectivity, in G. paradoxa was consistent with predictions from life-history traits of shorter lifespan, lower fecundity, more limited seed dispersal, and shorter plants, but inconsistent with a prediction of greater pollen dispersal by bird pollinators. Low pollen to seed dispersal ratios suggest seed dispersal plays a greater than expected role in maintaining connectivity in this semi-arid landscape. The study highlights a need for research that integrates aspects of seed ecology and seed and pollen dispersal as well as phylogeographic and genetic patterns in Gondwanan shrublands and other semi-arid landscapes globally.",2017
Multiple rewards have asymmetric effects on learning in bumblebees,Bombus impatiens; bumblebee; learning; memory; multitasking; nectar; pollen; pollination,DIVISION-OF-LABOR; APIS-MELLIFERA L; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; FORAGING SPECIALIZATION; TASK INTERFERENCE; LIMITED ATTENTION; NECTAR PRODUCTION; BUZZ-POLLINATION; FLOWER CONSTANCY; POLLEN REMOVAL,"In their natural environments, most animals must learn about multiple kinds of rewards, both within and across contexts. Despite this, the majority of research on animal learning involves a single reward type. For example, bees are an important model system for the study of cognition and its ecological consequences, but nearly all research to date on their learning concerns a single reward, nectar (carbohydrates), even though foragers often simultaneously collect pollen (protein). Features of learning under more ecologically realistic conditions involving multiple reward types are thus largely unexplored. To address this gap, we compared performance on a colour-learning task when floral surrogates offered bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, a single type of floral reward versus multiple, nutritionally distinct rewards. In one experiment, bees learned a floral association with nectar either alone or while simultaneously collecting pollen. In a reciprocal experiment, bees learned a floral association with pollen either alone or while simultaneously collecting nectar. Bees that collected pollen while learning about nectar did not suffer any detriment to learning which flower colour offered nectar. However, this was not the case for the reciprocal task: collecting nectar impaired bees' ability to learn and remember associations between floral colour and pollen. Our findings offer new insight into how bees learn in relation to ecologically realistic rewards and how cognitive constraints may shape their behaviour under ecologically realistic foraging scenarios.

Important topological properties of networks such as nestedness and modularity are thought to be affected by coevolution. However, there has been no test whether coevolution does, in fact, lead to predictable network structure. Here, we investigate the structure of simulated bipartite networks generated under different modes of coevolution. We ask whether evolutionary processes influence network structure and, furthermore, whether any emergent trends are influenced by the strength or ""intimacy"" of the species interactions. We find that coevolution leaves a weak and variable signal on network topology, particularly nestedness and modularity, which was not strongly affected by the intimacy of interactions. Our findings indicate that network metrics, on their own, should not be used to make inferences about processes underlying the evolutionary history of communities. Instead, a more holistic approach that combines network approaches with traditional phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions is needed.",2017

Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) is an ecologically and economically important understory shrub with an unclear species definition, coexisting in sympatric populations of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes. This study analyzes differences in bloom time between sympatric diploid and tetraploid V. corymbosum in natural populations, testing the potential for these cytotypes to interbreed and contributing to the formation and continuity of ploidy-level diversification within this species. Ploidal level was confirmed through DNA flow cytometry of sympatric plants from two populations in New Jersey, USA. Flower bloom date and corolla size were recorded over a 3-year period. Diploid corollas were 32% smaller than tetraploid corollas, making them easily identifiable in the field. Ploidy accounted for 55%-69% of the variation in bloom date, with diploids flowering about 1 week before tetraploids, and the remaining variation distributed among plants, among branches, and within branches. Notwithstanding these differences, there was modest overlap in flowering time between cytotypes, suggesting that cross-pollination is possible. This contributes evidence to the most current species definition of V. corymbosum as a single (mixed ploidy) species.",2017

This dissonance highlights a critical gap in the field of honey bee toxicology: there exists little mechanistic understanding of the patterns and processes of exposure that link honey bees to pesticides in their environment. The authors submit that 2 key processes underlie honey bee pesticide exposure: 1) the acquisition of pesticide by foraging bees, and 2) the in-hive distribution of pesticide returned by foragers. The acquisition of pesticide by foraging bees must be understood as the spatiotemporal intersection between environmental contamination and honey bee foraging activity. This implies that exposure is distributional, not discrete, and that a subset of foragers may acquire harmful doses of pesticide while the mean colony exposure would appear safe. The in-hive distribution of pesticide is a complex process driven principally by food transfer interactions between colony members, and this process differs importantly between pollen and nectar. High priority should be placed on applying the extensive literature on honey bee biology to the development of more rigorously mechanistic models of honey bee pesticide exposure. In combination with mechanistic effects modeling, mechanistic exposure modeling has the potential to integrate the field of honey bee toxicology, advancing both risk assessment and basic research.",2017

Habitat loss has been implicated as a leading cause of declines, suggesting that ecological restoration is likely to play an increasing role in bee conservation efforts. In the midwestern United States, restoration of tallgrass prairie has traditionally targeted plant community objectives without explicit consideration for bees. However, restoration of prairie vegetation is likely to provide ancillary benefits to bees through increased foraging and nesting resources. We investigated community assembly of bees across a chronosequence of restored eastern tallgrass prairies and compared patterns to those in control and reference habitats (old fields and prairie remnants, respectively). We collected bees for 3 yr and measured diversity and abundance of in-bloom flowering plants, vegetation structure, ground cover, and surrounding land use as predictors of bee abundance and bee taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that site-level variables, but not site type or restoration age, were significant predictors of bee abundance (bloom diversity, P=0.004; bare ground cover, P=0.02) and bee diversity (bloom diversity, P=0.01). There were significant correlations between overall composition of bee and blooming plant communities (Mantel test, P=0.002), and both plant and bee assemblages in restorations were intermediate between those of old fields and remnant prairies. Restorations exhibited high bee beta diversity, i.e., restored sites' bee assemblages were taxonomically and functionally differentiated from each other. This pattern was strong in younger restorations (<20yr old), but absent from older restorations (>20yr), suggesting restored prairie bee communities become more similar to one another and more similar to remnant prairie bee communities over time with the arrival of more species and functional groups of bees. Our results indicate that old fields, restorations, and remnants provide habitat for diverse and abundant bee communities, but continued restoration of old fields will help support and conserve bee communities more similar to reference bee communities characteristic of remnant prairies.",2017

However, it is yet elusive whether temporal petal closure is an idle floral character inherited from their ancestors or an adaptive trait to their habitats. Here, we monitored the process of temporal floral closure and re-opening in a thermogenic plant, Magnolia denudata (Magnoliaceae). Furthermore, we artificially interrupted temporal petal closure and investigated its effects on development of female and male gametophytes. Intriguingly, we found considerable anatomical changes in the anthers shortly after temporal closure of petals: disintegration of tapeta, crack of anther walls, and release of matured pollens. In comparison with normal flowers, artificially interrupted flowers (no petal closure) showed delayed anther development and slower pollen germination on stigmas, while little difference in embryo morphology was observed during the early stage of embryo development. Moreover, seed set and quality were significantly decreased when petal closure was prevented. In addition, we found pollination accelerated floral closure in M. denudata. Taken together, temporal floral closure benefits reproduction of M. denudata in early spring by promoting anther development and pollen function, which suggests that it is an adaptive floral trait to its specific habitat.",2017

One ecosystem property is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are stronger predictors of the mean size of bees, moths, frugivorous birds, and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and the abiotic environment, but suggest that temperature is the most relevant predictor of mean animal body size. Community-weighted means of plant traits and body sizes appear unsuitable to capture the complexity of plant-animal interactions.",2017

Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.",2017

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). With recent losses of managed honey bee colonies, there is increasing interest in feral honey bee colonies and their potential contribution to pollination services in agricultural, natural, and urban settings. However, in some regions the feral honey bee population consists primarily of Africanized honey bees. Africanized honey bees (AHB) are hybrids between European honey bees and the African honey bee, Apis mellifera scutellataLepeletier, and have generated economic, ecological, and human health concerns because of their aggressive behavior. In this study, we used two long-term datasets (7-10years) detailing the spatial and temporal distribution of AHB colonies in Tucson, AZ, USA, where feral colonies occupy a variety of cavities including water meter boxes. A stage-structured matrix model was used to elucidate the implications of nest site selection and the effects of colony terminations on the structure and dynamics of the AHB population. Our results suggest that Tucson's AHB population is driven by a relatively small number of source' colonies that escape termination (ca. 0.165 colonies per km(2) or 125 colonies in total), although immigrating swarms and absconding colonies from the surrounding area may have also contributed to the stability of the Tucson AHB population. Furthermore, the structure of the population has likely been impacted by the number and spatial distribution of water meter boxes across the city. The study provides an example of how urban wildlife populations are driven by interactions among landscape structure, human management, and behavioral traits conferred by an invasive genotype.",2017

The presence of B. borealis was previously predicted, but the presence of B. bimaculatus in Montana represents a substantial extension of its previously reported range. Four additional "" eastern"" bumble bee species are recorded from the state, and three species pairs thought to replace one another from the eastern to western United States are now known to be sympatric in Montana. Additionally, our data are consistent with reported declines in populations of Bombus occidentalis Greene and Bombus suckleyi Greene, highlighting a need for targeted surveys of these two species in Montana.",2017
First data on the prevalence and distribution of pathogens in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and Bombus pascuorum) from Spain,pollinators; pathogen dispersion; PCR; Apicystis bombi; Crithidia bombi; Nosema bombi,APIS-MELLIFERA; PARASITES; BEES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; VIRUS,"Bumblebees provide pollination services not only to wildflowers but also to economically important crops. In the context of the global decline of pollinators, there is an increasing interest in determining the pathogen diversity of bumblebee species. In this work, wild bumblebees of the species Bombus terrestris and Bombus pascuorum from northern and southern Spain were molecularly screened to detect and estimate prevalence of pathogens. One third of bumblebees were infected: while viruses only infected B. pascuorum, B. terrestris was infected by Apicystis bombi, Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi. Ecological differences between host species might affect the success of the pathogens biological cycle and consequently infection prevalence. Furthermore, sex of the bumblebees (workers or males), sampling area (north or south) and altitude were important predictors of pathogen prevalence. Understanding how these factors affect pathogens distribution is essential for future conservation of bumblebee wild populations.",2017

While research has concentrated on why and how dioecy evolves from hermaphroditism, the question of why dioecy is rare, despite repeated transitions to it, has received much less attention. Previous phylogenetic and theoretical studies have suggested that dioecy might be an evolutionary dead end. However, recent research indicates that the phylogenetic support for this hypothesis is attributable to a methodological bias and that there is no evidence for reduced diversification in dioecious angiosperms. The relative rarity of dioecy thus remains a puzzle. Here, we review evidence for the hypothesis that dioecy might be rare not because it is an evolutionary dead end, but rather because it easily reverts to hermaphroditism. We review what is known about transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy, and conclude that there is an important need to consider more widely the possibility of transitions away from dioecy, both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view, and by combining tools from molecular evolution and insights from ecology.",2017

Plant biologists have long speculated that outcrossing mating systems are more common at low than high latitudes owing to a greater predictability of plant-pollinator interactions in the tropics; however, these ideas have not previously been tested. Here, we present the first global biogeographic analysis of plant mating systems based on 624 published studies from 492 taxa. We found a weak decline in outcrossing rate towards higher latitudes and among some biomes, but no biogeographic patterns in the frequency of self-incompatibility. Incorporating life history and growth form into biogeographic analyses reduced or eliminated the importance of latitude and biome in predicting outcrossing or self-incompatibility. Our results suggest that biogeographic patterns in mating system are more likely a reflection of the frequency of life forms across latitudes rather than the strength of plant-pollinator interactions.",2017
Spatial and temporal variations in floral resource availability affect bumblebee communities in heathlands,Landscape; Bombus; Ericaceae; Spruce plantations; Colony size; Colony lifetime,BOMBUS SPP. HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; SPECIES RICHNESS; FORAGING BUMBLEBEES; POLLINATOR DECLINES; HABITAT AREA; BEES; NECTAR; DENSITY; APIDAE,"Modifications of landscape structure and composition can decrease the availability of floral resources, resulting in the decline of many pollinator species, including bumblebees. These declines may have significant ecological consequences, because bumblebees pollinate a large range of plant species. Our study was carried out in heathlands, open semi-natural habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. We analysed how floral resources affect bumblebee communities throughout the colony lifetime at three scales: plot scale, heathland patch scale, and landscape scale. Floral density at the plot scale and spruce plantations at the landscape scale influenced bumblebee communities. The abundance of bumblebees on ericaceous species was higher when the landscape included a substantial proportion of unsuitable foraging habitat (i.e., spruce plantations). Both life history traits and colony life cycle stage influenced bumblebee responses to the availability of floral resources. Bumblebees were more affected by floral resources during the colony development phase than during the nest-foundation or mating phases. Moreover, bumblebees of species that form large colonies needed larger quantities of favourable foraging habitat, compared with small-colony bees, and their proportion decreased in habitats dominated by spruce plantations. In conclusion, the conservation of plant-bumblebee interactions will require management at a larger spatial scale than the restricted protected habitats. Moreover, at the landscape scale, both quantity of favourable foraging patches and their ecological continuity are important to conserve both small-and large-colony species.",2017
Drivers of genetic differentiation in a generalist insect-pollinated herb across spatial scales,genetic structure; isolation by distance; landscape genetics; plant-pollinator interactions; spatial scale,LANDSCAPE GENETICS; ERYSIMUM-MEDIOHISPANICUM; MEDIATED SELECTION; GENOTYPING ERRORS; DISTANCE; PLANT; ADAPTATION; SPECIALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; COLONIZATION,"The isolation-by-distance model (IBD) predicts that genetic differentiation among populations increases with geographic distance. Yet, empirical studies show that a variety of ecological, topographic and historical factors may override the effect of geographic distance on genetic variation. This may particularly apply to species with narrow but highly heterogeneous distribution ranges, such as those occurring along elevational gradients. Using nine SSR markers, we study the genetic differentiation of the montane pollination-generalist herb, Erysimum mediohispanicum. Because the effects of any given factor may depend on the geographic scale considered, we investigate the contribution of different environmental and historical factors at three different spatial scales. We evaluate five competing models that put forward the role of geographic distance, local environmental factors [biotic interactions (IBEb) and climatic variables (IBEa)], landscape resistance (IBR) and phylogeographic patterns (IBP), respectively. We find significant IBD regardless of the spatial scale and the genetic distance estimator considered. However, IBEa and IBP also play a prominent role in shaping genetic differentiation patterns at the larger spatial scales, and IBR is significant at the fine spatial scale. Overall, our results highlight the importance of combining different estimators, statistical approaches and spatial scales to disentangle the relative importance of the various ecological factors contributing to the shaping of genetic divergence patterns in natural populations.",2017
Effects of sampling effort on estimates of the structure of replacement networks,Competitive interactions; Ecological networks; Facilitation; Forest dynamics; Plant community; Replacement networks; Sapling recruitment; Strongly connected components,FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; PLANT FACILITATION; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; SPECIES-RICHNESS; SEED DISPERSAL; COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS; RECRUITMENT,"AimsImportant aspects of plant community dynamics depend on interactions between plant species that affect the processes of recruitment and the replacement of dead individuals by new ones. These interactions blend in the replacement network of the community. The qualitative and functional structure of replacement networks can provide insights on community stability properties. The goal of this study was to analyse how sampling effort affects estimates of different descriptors of replacement networks. LocationMixed pine-oak forests in southern Spain. methods we sampled the replacement networks of nine forest patches. In each forest we surveyed 16 plots of 25mx25m, locating all the saplings of woody species and noting whether they were recruiting under the canopy of some plant species or in open interspaces. Using the replacement networks from the plots of each forest we constructed curves relating network descriptor estimates to sampling effort. Additionally we calculated the completeness of basic network elements (number of species and interactions) using rarefaction and extrapolation techniques. results number of species (S) and connectance (C) stabilized within our range of sampling effort. The estimates of S reached completeness values above 97%. However, the number of interactions in the network (L) and the mean number or interactions per species (k) did not stabilize, although the estimates of L reached completeness values above 86%. With few exceptions, the parameters describing the functional structure of the network and those related to community stability stabilized within our range of sampling effort. conclusions our results suggest that most replacement networks descriptors in the studied forests can be reliably estimated from samples of around 1ha. Since plots used in forest ecology are commonly around that size, replacement network monitoring can be easily incorporated in forest ecology studies as a highly cost-effective tool to explore community dynamics. The reliability of replacement network estimates will provide both a solid foundation for further developments and also a straightforward comparison of results obtained from multiple communities.",2017
Invasive bumble bees reduce nectar availability for honey bees by robbing raspberry flower buds,Honey bees; Invasive bumble bee; Flower buds; Nectar production; Nectar robbing; Raspberry,BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; FRUIT-SET; PLANT REPRODUCTION; WILD POLLINATORS; VACCINIUM-ASHEI; APIS-MELLIFERA; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPE; ARGENTINA,"The introduction of exotic bees for crop pollination is an increasingly common practice worldwide. While beneficial for crop production, exotic species may become invasive with several deleterious ecological and economic impacts. We studied whether robbing of flower buds by a highly invasive bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) reduces nectar availability for managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). We assessed the proportion of robbed buds, and nectar availability in flowers and buds (robbed and non-robbed) in 16 raspberry fields along gradients of bumble bee and honey bee abundance in NW Patagonia, Argentina. We also measured nectar production and replenishment in flowers that developed from robbed and non-robbed buds in one experimental field. Across fields, the proportion of robbed buds increased with the abundance of bumble bees, but not of honey bees. At anthesis, flowers from buds that were robbed once contained half the nectar, and produced two thirds of the nectar compared to those flowers that had not been robbed. Therefore, high abundance of invasive bumble bees can reduce resources for managed honey bees by robbing flower buds. This study reveals a novel, negative impact of bumble bee invasions that could potentially affect honey production.",2017

Here, we quantify previously undocumented floral traits related to pollination ecology including rewards, scent, and breeding system and include the species in a molecular phylogenetic and dating analysis to reconstruct the evolution of trait similarity and variation. Flowers of P. bodkinii produce oil and are characterised by a scent bouquet comprising 59 compounds including aliphatics, benzenoids and isoprenoids. 3,5-Dimethoxytoluene, prominent among these, is also produced by flowers of several distantly related species pollinated by oil-collecting Rediviva bees and is known to elicit antennal responses in these insects. We found that flowers of P. appressus are capable of autonomous self-pollination, produce neither nectar nor oil, and their 500-fold weaker scent includes fewer than ten compounds. Separate phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear data partitions both strongly supported a monophyletic Pachites in which the two species diverged approximately 12 million years ago. Of the features that characterise this genus, the long column part is clearly derived, whereas the subequal sepals and petals may be derived or plesiomorphic. Together, these results suggest that general floral trait similarity between Pachites species reflects common ancestry, whereas differences in floral morphology, rewards and scent chemistry likely reflect adaptations for different pollination strategies, which evolved during the long time since divergence.",2017
Variation and synchrony of tree species mast seeding in an old-growth temperate forest,Mast seeding; Plant reproductive strategy; Pollination efficiency hypothesis; Predator satiation hypothesis; Seed rain; Weather drivers,CLIMATE-CHANGE; REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; WIND POLLINATION; NEW-ZEALAND; PLANTS; VARIABILITY; DISPERSAL; PREDATORS,"QuestionsMast seeding, i.e. synchronous highly variable seed production among years, occurs in many perennial plant species and across diverse plant communities. Two predominant hypotheses for mast seeding are pollination efficiency and predator satiation, with weather conditions as a proximate cause. Little consensus has been achieved regarding the relative impacts of ultimate selection and proximate weather on variation in seed production. Moreover, mast-seeding studies often focus on a single species or phylogenetically closely related species, while studies on plant communities consisting of tree species with a diversity of reproductive strategies are less common. LocationA 25-ha Changbaishan temperate forest dynamic plot, northeast China. methods we used 8yr of seed rain data to characterize patterns and evaluate underlying selective drivers of mast seeding. We employed generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) to analyse the relationships between inter-annual variability of mast seeding and weather conditions. results all 20 species in this forest community exhibited high variability in annual seed production, but the magnitude of seed production among species was generally asynchronous across years. Wind-pollinated species had higher inter-annual variation of seed production than animal-pollinated species, while species dispersed by seed predators and abiotic modes (e.g. wind and gravity) showed little variation. Species responded individually to weather conditions for both temperature and precipitation, and spring phenology in the same year as seed production had a larger effect among species than both the weather conditions of the same summer and season-long lags. conclusions our findings suggest that pollination efficiency hypothesis had a much stronger effect than predation satiation hypothesis on mast seeding, and weather conditions demonstrated the proximate role of weather drivers in producing the community-wide mast-seeding pattern. We emphasize the need to simultaneously assess drivers of mast seeding for multiple species within a plant community.",2017

The present paper shows for the first time the results of micromorphological, anatomical, and ultrastructural analyses of floral nectaries in Aesculus hippocastanum. We have also described the forage and signal attractants of these flowers, which are important for the ecology of pollination. Using light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy, we demonstrated that the A. hippocastanum nectary forming a lobed disc is histologically differentiated into the epidermis with stomata, nectariferous parenchyma, subglandular parenchyma, and vascular bundles reaching the basal part of the nectariferous parenchyma. The use of histochemical assays revealed the presence of insoluble polysaccharides, lipids, terpenoids, and polyphenols including coumarins in the nectary tissues. Nectar is exuded onto the nectary surface via stomata and the permeable cuticle. As indicated by the observation of the ultrastructure of the nectary cells, transport of pre-nectar into parenchymal cells may proceed via the symplast and apoplast. We have also demonstrated that nectar transfer outside the protoplasts of parenchymal cells has a character of granulocrine secretion. A. hippocastanum flowers produce nectar abundantly; one flower secreted on average 2.64 mg of nectar and the concentration of sugars in the nectar was 33%.",2017
Fitness consequences of altering floral circadian oscillations for Nicotiana attenuata,,MANDUCA-SEXTA; CLOCK; FLOWERS; PLANTS; ARABIDOPSIS; SPECIALIZATION; ORIENTATION; PHYSIOLOGY; AQUILEGIA; EMISSION,"Ecological interactions between flowers and pollinators are all about timing. Flower opening/closing and scent emissions are largely synchronized with pollinator activity, and a circadian clock regulates these rhythms. However, whether the circadian clock increases a plant's reproductive success by regulating these floral rhythms remains untested. Flowers of Nicotiana attenuata, a wild tobacco, diurnally and rhythmically open, emit scent and move vertically through a 140 degrees arc to interact with nocturnal hawkmoths. We tethered flowers to evaluate the importance of flower positions for Manduca sexta-mediated pollinations; flower position dramatically influenced pollination. We examined the pollination success of phase-shifted flowers, silenced in circadian clock genes, NaZTL, NaLHY, and NaTOC1, by RNAi. Circadian rhythms in N. attenuata flowers are responsible for altered seed set from outcrossed pollen.",2017

Despite their importance, however, information on their distribution patterns is limited. We propose potential distribution models for 11 Melipona species in the region. Our main findings support previous data which suggest a revision of the taxonomic status of some species (e.g., M. yucatanica), and set a baseline on the conservation status of other species, challenging previous reports (e.g., M. beecheii). Our models show that 20 % or less of the areas of predicted presence are under protection, with large proportions corresponding to low-intensity cropland, offering conservation alternatives in disturbed landscapes. This information will assist further studies on potential conservation strategies, and will aid in analyzing and formulating hypotheses regarding the biogeography of these species.",2017

Although the genetic structure of some plants has been examined in previous studies, it remains mostly unconfirmed whether different plants in the same habitat have similar genetic structure, and the factors that have influenced structure in plants of the region are also unknown. Accordingly, we employed the approaches of molecular phylogeography and species distribution modelling to compare spatial genetic structure and ecological niches for three montane forest and four lowland xerophytic plants in East Central Asia. The results obtained suggest that the three forest species retreat westward during the Last Glacial Maximum as indicated by higher genetic differentiation in western populations. By contrast, multiple peaks of genetic differentiation were detected from chloroplast DNA datasets among populations in each of the four xerophytic species. Based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer datasets, anemophilous pollination had shaped the high dispersal ability for pollen-mediated gene flow and outcrossing pollination had triggered extensive heterozygosity among populations. In conclusion, palaeoclimatic changes and species traits have mainly influenced the spatial genetic structure of forest and xerophytic plants in arid Eastern Central Asia. ",2017
Mutualism supports biodiversity when the direct competition is weak,,STABILITY; NETWORKS; ECOSYSTEMS; ARCHITECTURE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY,"A key question of theoretical ecology is which properties of ecosystems favour their stability and help maintaining biodiversity. This question recently reconsidered mutualistic systems, generating intense controversy about the role of mutualistic interactions and their network architecture. Here we show analytically and verify with simulations that reducing the effective interspecific competition and the propagation of perturbations positively influences structural stability against environmental perturbations, enhancing persistence. Noteworthy, mutualism reduces the effective interspecific competition only when the direct interspecific competition is weaker than a critical value. This critical competition is in almost all cases larger in pollinator networks than in random networks with the same connectance. Highly connected mutualistic networks reduce the propagation of environmental perturbations, a mechanism reminiscent of MacArthur's proposal that ecosystem complexity enhances stability. Our analytic framework rationalizes previous contradictory results, and it gives valuable insight on the complex relationship between mutualism and biodiversity.",2017

METHODS: We report on spatial variation in functional responses by a seed predator (SP) and its parasitic wasps associated with the herb Ruellia nudiflora. We assessed the influence of plant density on consumer responses and determined whether density effects and spatial variation in functional responses altered natural selection by these consumers on the plant. We established common gardens at two sites in Yucatan, Mexico, and planted R. nudiflora at two densities in each garden. We recorded fruit output and SP and parasitoid attack; calculated relative fitness (seed number) under scenarios of three trophic levels (accounting for SP and parasitoid effects), two trophic levels (accounting for SP but not parasitoid effects), and one trophic level (no consumer effects); and compared selection strength on fruit number under these scenarios across sites and densities. KEY RESULTS: There was spatial variation in SP recruitment, whereby the SP functional response was negatively density-dependent at one site but density-independent at the other; parasitoid responses were density-independent and invariant across sites. Site variation in SP attack led, in turn, to differences in SP selection on fruit output, and parasitoids did not alter SP selection. There were no significant effects of density at either site. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a link between consumer functional responses and consumer selection on plants, which deepens our understanding of geographic variation in the evolutionary outcomes of multitrophic interactions.",2017

We investigated whether pollinator-mediated interactions between coflowering plants vary with plant density, coflowering neighbor identity, and flowering season. METHODS: We conducted a field experiment in which flowering time and floral neighborhood were manipulated in a factorial design. Early- and late-flowering Clarkia unguiculata plants were placed into arrays with C. biloba neighbors, noncongeneric neighbors, additional conspecific plants, or no additional plants as a density control. We compared whole-plant pollen limitation of seed set, pollinator behavior, and pollen deposition among treatments. KEY RESULTS: Interactions mediated by shared pollinators depended on the identity of the neighbor and possibly changed through time, although flowering-season comparisons were compromised by low early-season plant survival. Interactions with conspecific neighbors were likely competitive late in the season. Interactions with C. biloba appeared to involve facilitation or neutral interactions. Interactions with noncongeners were more consistently competitive. The community composition of pollinators varied among treatment combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator-mediated interactions involved competition and likely facilitation, depending on coflowering neighbor. Experimental manipulation helped to reveal context-dependent variation in indirect biotic interactions.",2017

A pollen-collecting device was placed in the meteorological station at Es-Senia airport, near Oran city. It was found that the pollen harvest during the first year was 4230 grains, which is significantly higher than that in the second year which produced 2258 grains. These data gave a mean annual index of 3246 pollen grains, 99.7% of which were positively identified. Pollen from herbaceous plants (69.5%) proved significantly more abundant than arboreal and shrub pollen (27.9 and 2.3% respectively). The pollen types identified, in decreasing order of abundance, were Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, Plantago, Olea, wild Poaceae, Lygeum, Cupressaceae, Urticaceae, Quercus, Pinus, total Asteraceae, Eucalyptus, Brassicaceae, Casuarina, Pistacia, Arecaceae, Apiaceae, Thymeleaceae and Rumex. The abundance range was Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (41.4%) to Rumex (0.6%). The winter pollen spectrum largely comprised Arecaceae and Cupressaceae. Pollination during spring included most taxa, i.e. total Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, Lygeum, Olea, Pinus, Pistacia, Plantago, wild Poaceae, Quercus, Rumex and Urticaceae. During the summer Apiaceae and Eucalyptus both pollinated, and Casuarina pollen was largely produced in autumn.

However, gene flow from GE forest plantations is a large source of ecological, social and legal controversy. The use of genetic technologies to mitigate or prevent gene flow has been discussed widely and should be technically feasible in a variety of plantation taxa. However, potential ecological effects of such modifications, and their social acceptability, are not well understood. Focusing on Eucalyptus, Pinus, Populus and Pseudotsuga - genera that represent diverse modes of pollination and seed dispersal - we conducted in-depth reviews of ecological processes associated with reproductive tissues. We also explored potential impacts of various forms of reproductive modification at stand and landscape levels, and means for mitigating impacts. We found little research on potential reactions by the public and other stakeholders to reproductive modification in forest plantations. However, there is considerable research on related areas that suggest key dimensions of concern and support. We provide detailed suggestions for research to understand the biological and social dimensions of containment technologies, and consider the role of regulatory and market restrictions that obstruct necessary ecological and genetic research.",2017

Dust particles and pollen grains are similar in size. Dust deposition might therefore influence the pollination and reproduction of flowering plants. Little is known about such effects, however, despite more general interest in ecological effects of dust. Methodology. We used observational and experimental methods to explore whether dust generated by traffic on unpaved roads affects the amounts of pollen received and numbers of seeds produced by four species of native wildflowers in the western United States. Pivotal results. Flowers of Nuttall's larkspur (Delphinium nuttallianum), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), Lewis flax (Linumlewisii), and sulphur paintbrush (Castilleja sulphurea) growing 1-2mfrom a road received substantially more dust and less pollen than those growing 40-50 m away. We observed the same pattern when we transplanted individuals of the first two species into pots and placed pots near to compared with far from a road. Experimental ""hand dusting"" of scarlet gilia and Lewis flax plants also reduced stigma pollen loads to a degree that resembled the average effect of road proximity for those species. On the other hand, numbers of seeds per flower (""seed set"") did not vary consistently for any species as a function of road proximity or hand-dusting treatment. Conclusions. Several mechanisms might contribute to the different effects of dust on pollen loads and seed set. Wediscuss four possible mechanisms, which we refer to as pollen excess, pollen quality, resource limitation, and compensatory herbivory. These mechanisms suggest avenues for further study of dust, pollination, and plant reproduction with this and other systems.",2017
Emergence of consensus as a modular-to-nested transition in communication dynamics,,ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORK; LEAST EIGENVALUE; COMPARTMENTALIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; ARCHITECTURE; PERSISTENCE; SYSTEMS; GRAPHS,"Online social networks have transformed the way in which humans communicate and interact, leading to a new information ecosystem where people send and receive information through multiple channels, including traditional communication media. Despite many attempts to characterize the structure and dynamics of these techno-social systems, little is known about fundamental aspects such as how collective attention arises and what determines the information life-cycle. Current approaches to these problems either focus on human temporal dynamics or on semiotic dynamics. In addition, as recently shown, information ecosystems are highly competitive, with humans and memes striving for scarce resources-visibility and attention, respectively. Inspired by similar problems in ecology, here we develop a methodology that allows to cast all the previous aspects into a compact framework and to characterize, using microblogging data, information-driven systems as mutualistic networks. Our results show that collective attention around a topic is reached when the user-meme network self-adapts from a modular to a nested structure, which ultimately allows minimizing competition and attaining consensus. Beyond a sociological interpretation, we explore such resemblance to natural mutualistic communities via well-known dynamics of ecological systems.",2017
From the Lab Bench to the Forest: Ecology and Defence Mechanisms of Volatile-Mediated 'Talking Trees',,PLANT COMMUNICATION; INTERPLANT COMMUNICATION; INDUCED RESISTANCE; RESPONSES; HERBIVORES; CHEMISTRY; EMISSIONS; SAGEBRUSH; WILLOWS; INDUCE,"Transfer of information is important for almost all biotic interactions, but has received less attention in plants. Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) emitted from floral tissues and green tissues of plants affect how plants interact with each other (informally termed 'plant communication'), with mutualists such as pollinators and with enemies such as herbivores. In this chapter, we give an overview of VOC-based plant communication, in which plants that eavesdrop on VOC signals emitted from neighbouring herbivore-damaged plants increase their defence. While historically controversial, recent research has begun to establish the details of these interactions in various plant systems, including the identity of the VOC signal, the mechanism of VOC perception and the transduction pathways that link VOC perception to a defensive response. At the same time, ecological studies have begun to establish the evolutionary drivers of plant communication. Key insights from these studies are that these responses are kinspecific, memorable and mediated by known internal defence signals and epigenetic regulations in plant cells. Moving forward, studies that connect our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of plant-plant communication with their ecological consequences will help determine the importance of this type of defensive induction as well as the targets of selection within the plant-plant communication apparatus.",2017
Plant Communication With Herbivores,,VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; POLLUTED ATMOSPHERES; ANTHONOMUS-GRANDIS; SOLIDAGO-ALTISSIMA; INDUCED RESISTANCE; PARASITIC WASPS; ORAL SECRETION; HOST LOCATION; INSECT,"Plants and herbivores both release volatile organic compounds that have important roles in mediating important biological functions related to defence and reproduction. Plants emit complex blends of chemicals that are involved in multitrophic interactions, coordination of systemic defence responses and pollination, whereas herbivorous insects release pheromones that play important roles in attracting mates, instigating defence responses and initiating aggregation. Interactions between plants and herbivores have been subject to a wealth of studies and knowledge on their biology, biochemistry, ecology and evolution is constantly expanding. In this chapter the idea of communication between plants and herbivores will be explored. Communication between organisms of consecutive trophic levels is somewhat controversial due to unidirectional reliance and competition precluding some of the requirements of a conventional communication process, but there are growing examples of where chemically mediated interactions between plants and herbivores can be viewed as eavesdropping by a signal recipient, or even as true communication where both chemical emitter and receiver gain a benefit from communication. Examples of herbivores responding to plant-emitted cues and plants responding to herbivore-emitted cues are both explored, and suggestions for future directions in this field are provided.",2017

Despite the generally accepted 'mi-nority- cytotype exclusion' theory, the specific mechanisms leading to successful establishment and persistence of new polyploids remain controversial. The majority of newly formed polyploids do not become established, because they are less common, have fewer potential mates or may not be able to compete successfully with co-occurring progenitors at lower ploidy levels. Changes in floral traits and ecological niches have been proposed as important mechanisms to overcome this initial frequency-dependent disadvantage. The aim of this study was to determine whether dodecaploids of the heterostylous P. marginata differ from their hexaploid progenitors in P. marginata and P. allionii for selected floral traits and ecological preferences that might be involved in establishment and persist-ence, providing a possible explanation for the origin of polyploidized populations. Methods Floral morphological traits and ecological niche preferences among dodecaploids and their hexaploid progenitors in P. marginata and P. allionii, all restricted to the south-western Alps, were quantified and compared Key Results Differences in floral traits were detected between dodecaploids and their closest relatives, but such differences might be too weak to counter the strength of minority cytotype disadvantage and are unlikely to enable the coexistence of different cytotypes. Furthermore, the results suggest the preservation of full distyly and no transi-tion to selfing in dodecaploids. Finally, dodecaploids occur almost exclusively in environments that are predicted to be suitable also for their closest hexaploid relatives. Conclusions In light of the results, P. marginata dodecaploids have probably been able to establish and persist by occupying geographical areas not yet filled by their closest relatives without significant evolution in their climatic and pollination niches. Dispersal limitation and minority-cytotype exclusion probably maintain their current range disjunct from those of its close relatives.",2017
A terpenoid metabolic network modelled as graph database,terpenoid; metabolic network; secondary metabolism; NoSQL; graph database,ISOPRENOID BIOSYNTHESIS; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; PATHWAY; RECONSTRUCTION; BIOINFORMATICS; GENOMES; GENES,"Terpenoids are involved in interactions such as signalling for communication intra/inter species, signalling molecules to attract pollinating insects, and defence against herbivores and microbes. Owing to their chemical composition, many terpenoids possess vast pharmacological applicability in medicine and biotechnology, besides important roles in ecology, industry and commerce. Metabolic networks are composed of metabolic pathways, they allow us to represent the metabolism of an organism. The biosynthesis of terpenes has been widely studied over the years, and it is well known that they can be synthesised from two metabolic pathways: mevalonate pathway (MVA) and non-mevalonate pathway (MEP). On the other hand, genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic networks faces many challenges, including organisational data storage and data modelling, to properly represent the complexity of systems biology. Recent NoSQL database paradigms have introduced new concepts of scalable storage and data queries. With regard to biological data, the use of graph databases has grown because of its versatility. In this paper, we propose 2Path, a graph database designed to represent terpenoid metabolic networks. It is modelled in such a way so that it preserves important terpenoid biosynthesis characteristics.",2017
Overlap in Cave Usage and Period of Activity as Factors Structuring the Interactions between Bats and Ectoparasites,Chiroptera; Streblidae; Cerrado; Interaction network; Caves; Brazil,FLIES DIPTERA; SEED DISPERSAL; HOST-PARASITE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NEOTROPICAL BATS; NETWORKS; MODULARITY; ABUNDANCE; POLLINATION; STREBLIDAE,"Bats perform important ecosystem services such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bats are also hosts to obligate ectoparasites, which influence their behavior and, thus, compromise their ecosystem functions. Therefore, the study of the bat-ectoparasitic interaction network and its driven factors is basic for understanding variation in the ecosystem services provided by bats. In this study, we evaluated the structure of the network of interactions between bats and their ectoparasite arthropods, testing the roles of overlap in cave usage and period of activity as factors structuring the interactions. We conducted the study in caves within the Cerrado ecosystem near Brasilia, Brazil. Our results show that the bat-ectoparasite network has a modular pattern and is highly specialized. The observed pattern was explained by the greater probability of transmission of ectoparasites among bats sharing the same cave during the same period of the year. Furthermore, our data showed that the rate of bat infestation by different ectoparasite species is related to the degree of exposure of bats according to their abundance and activity period, but not with the number of caves used to roost. Thus, we believe that the frequency of activity and encounters between bats, and therefore the rate of ectoparasite transmission, is an important regulatory mechanism of bat-ectoparasite networks. This ecological mechanism may facilitate the formation of specific interactions by spatial and temporal segregation and co-evolution of parasite species among groups of roosting bats.",2017
"Reproductive Strategy, Performance, and Population Dynamics of the Introduced Weed Black Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger)",Invasion; seed bank; demography,HERBIVORY; PLANTS,"Determining whether and how to manage an introduced species requires basic ecological and biological knowledge. If a decision is made to actively manage an invader, doing so efficiently and effectively is critical. Basic biological or ecological information can be key in designing effective and cost-efficient management approaches. We used a greenhouse experiment and observational field studies of naturalized populations to study the modes of pollination, fecundity in the field, seed ecology, population dynamics, and demography of the introduced and toxic weed, black henbane. We showed that henbane was able to self-pollinate. Furthermore, outcrossing did not increase number or size of seeds. Plants in the sampled populations produced an estimated average of 25,300 +/- 4,004 seeds by the middle of the growing season. We found no difference in the viability of field-collected seeds that were 1 to 4 yr old. The number of flowering plants in a population was best predicted by the number of rosettes at that location in July of the previous year. The probability of rosettes surviving over the winter to reach reproductive maturity increased with precipitation and growing degree days. Total population sizes fluctuated dramatically between years. Henbane populations are ephemeral, but with large seed banks, outbreaks are possible if conditions are right. Given that this weed is toxic to livestock and humans, it is important to identify infestations and manage populations.",2017

A watch list made up of high-priority early detection species that are not yet known to occur in the target area is an important EDRR tool. To make a watch list I used the EDDMapS database of plant occurrences to identify nonnative plants reported within 150 miles of the District of Columbia. I sorted the list to include only species not reported by park staff to be invasive in park natural areas. The resulting 97 candidate species were prioritized using NatureServe's Invasive Species Assessment Protocol (ISAP) to produce an Invasive Species Impact Rank (I-Rank). The ISAP includes questions in four categories (Ecological Impact, Current Distribution and Abundance, Trend in Distribution and Abundance, and Management Difficulty). Each category contributes to an overall I-Rank. The 20 species with the highest I-Rank became the basis for a priority watch list. The watch list will be used to guide presence/absence data collection and treat all identified populations on park land. Removing these populations will protect natural areas and reduce management costs in future years.",2017

What is long-distance dispersal? And a taxonomy of dispersal events,dispersal; frugivory; plant-animal interactions; pollination; seed dispersal,SEED DISPERSAL; GENE FLOW; PRUNUS-MAHALEB; POLLEN DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; RECRUITMENT; POPULATION; LANDSCAPE; PLANTS; TREES,"1. Dispersal is a key individual-based process influencing many life-history attributes and scaling up to population-level properties (e.g. metapopulation connectivity). A persistent challenge in dispersal ecology has been the robust characterization of dispersal functions (kernels), a fundamental tool to predict how dispersal processes respond under global change scenarios. Particularly, the rightmost tail of these functions, that is the long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, are difficult to characterize empirically and to model in realistic ways. 2. But, when is it a LDD event? In the specific case of plants, dispersal has three basic components: (i) a distinct (sessile) source, the maternal plant producing the fruits or the paternal tree acting as a source of pollen; (ii) a distance component between source and target locations; and (iii) a vector actually performing the movement entailing the dispersal event. Here, I discuss operative definitions of LDD based on their intrinsic properties: (i) events crossing geographic boundaries among stands; and (ii) events contributing to effective gene flow and propagule migration. 3. Strict-sense long-distance dispersal involves movement both outside the stand geographic limits and outside the genetic neighbourhood area of individuals. Combinations of propagule movements within/outside these two spatial reference frames result in four distinct modes of LDD. 4. Synthesis. I expect truncation of seed dispersal kernels to have multiple consequences on demography and genetics, following to the loss of key dispersal services in natural populations. Irrespective of neighbourhood sizes, loss of LDD events may result in more structured and less cohesive genetic pools, with increased isolation by distance extending over broader areas. Proper characterization of the LDD events helps to assess, for example, how the ongoing defaunation of large-bodied frugivores pervasively entails the loss of crucial LDD functions.",2017

POPULATIONS; BUTTEL-REEPEN; SEQUENCE DATA; GENUS APIS; DIVERSITY; AFRICA,"As plant pollinators, honey bees (Apis mellifera) play a very important role in agricultural and non agricultural crop production. In addition, honey bee products are of nutritional, medicinal, cosmetic and economic value to society. With the current changing trends in Uganda's farming systems, it is important to determine the level of genetic variation, and extent of differentiation in the honey bee population. This will be crucial for a successful honey bee management system for improved productivity and conservation of the honey bees in the different agro-ecological zones of Uganda. To achieve this, we investigated the genetic variation in honey bees from ten agro-ecological zones of Uganda by sequencing the intergenic region of the Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) COI-COII. We observed high haplotype diversity (Hd > 0.530) within a majority of the agro-ecological zones except the Southern Highland agro-ecological zone (Hd = 0.154). Both the population structure and the phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of two honey bee races (A. m. adansonii and A. m. scutellata) in Uganda. A. m. adansonii is more widespread in the agro-ecological zones in the northern and eastern parts of Uganda while A. m. scutellata is more spread in the southern and western parts of the country. This is the first exhaustive population genetics research on bees in Uganda, and provides results that are useful to the beekeeping industry for effective management of the honey bee population. These results should be considered while planning beekeeping activities in the country.",2017

Thanks to the development of novel methodological approaches and the ever-increasing availability of informative molecular markers, it is indeed now possible to test more and more complex evolutionary scenarios. Here, we are limiting our review to studies on herbivorous insects (excluding work on the evolution of pollinating insects), and we provide an overview of the variety of approaches employed to answer fundamental questions in plant/insect evolution. More specifically, our review addresses studies that have focused on the following: (1) reconstructing the evolutionary history of the associations with plants; (2) inferring the diversification dynamics of herbivorous insects and (3) studying the biogeographic history of herbivorous insects. Finally, we attempt to decipher whether general trends in the evolution of planteinsect interactions have emerged from these studies and highlight the most promising perspectives in this field.",2017

They are important for humans acting as crucial pollinators, biological control agents, decomposers, and bioindicators. One third of its diversity is found in the Neotropical Region, but the taxonomic knowledge for this region is incomplete. Thus, taxonomic revisions and species checklists of Syrphidae in the Neotropics are the highest priority for biodiversity studies. Therefore, we present the first checklist of Syrphidae for Ecuador based on literature records, and provide as well the original reference for the first time species citations for the country. A total of 201 species were recorded for Ecuador, with more than 600 records from 24 provinces and 237 localities. Tungurahua, Pastaza, and Galapagos were the best sampled provinces. Although the reported Ecuadorian syrphid fauna only comprises 11.2 % of the described Neotropical species, Ecuador has the third highest flower fly diversity density after Costa Rica and Suriname. These data indicate the high species diversity for this country in such small geographic area.",2017

Many such pressures impose counter-selection for smaller, less attractive flowers. In self-incompatible taxa, floral investment in attraction is required to ensure cross-pollination, setting up a potential energetic trade-off with investment in fecundity through pollen and seeds. Methods - This study assesses ecological and evolutionary causes of variation in floral morphology across the diverse genus Helianthus (Asteraceae), focusing on floral size, colour, water content, and relative investment in attractive but sterile ray florets versus non-showy but fertile disc florets. Key results - All floral traits were found to be highly evolutionarily labile, and the trade-off in relative investment between ray and disc florets was found to evolve independently of floral size. Both floral size and disc water content were strongly correlated with source site climate and soil characteristics, with larger heads and higher water content repeatedly evolving in more fertile and drier habitats consistent with aspects of the resource-cost and enemy-escape hypotheses of floral trait evolution, respectively. The evolution of disc colour and relative ray-disc investment was not explained by life history, flowering period, or source site environmental characteristics, suggesting that the evolution of these traits may instead be driven by other selective pressures, including perhaps pollinators. Conclusions - Together the results of this study suggest that the macroevolution of sunflower floral architecture is likely driven by selective pressures from multiple biotic and abiotic factors, with habitat environmental conditions influencing some but not all aspects of floral morphology.",2017

The identity of stingless bee species in Africa has not been fully documented. The present study explored the utility of morphometrics and DNA barcoding for identification of African stingless bee populations, and to further employ these tools to identify potential cryptic variation within species. Stingless bee samples were collected from three ecological zones, namely Kakamega Forest, Mwingi and Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, which are geographically distant and cover high, medium and low altitudes, respectively. Forewing and hind leg morphometric characters were measured to determine the extent of morphological variation between the populations. DNA barcodes were generated from the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI) gene. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the morphometric measurements separated the bee samples into three clusters: (1) Meliponula bocandei; (2) Meliponula lendliana + Plebeina hildebrandti; (3) Dactylurina schmidti + Meliponula ferruginea black + Meliponula ferruginea reddish brown, but Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) separated all the species except the two morphospecies (M. ferruginea reddish brown and black). The analysis of the COI sequences showed that DNA barcoding can be used to identify all the species studied and revealed remarkable genetic distance (7.3%) between the two M. ferruginea morphs. This is the first genetic evidence that M. ferruginea black and M. ferruginea reddish brown are separate species.",2017

We review the mechanisms at play in the responses of planteinsect interactions to global changes, including increased temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, modification of land use and pollution. We distinguish between the direct effects of global changes on each partner from the indirect impacts on insects via the responses of plants. The indirect effects include a change in the nutritional quality of the plant tissues for herbivore insects, as well as a change in the microclimatic conditions at the leaf surface. Pollinators are involved in a close symbiotic relationship with their favourite plants, and any depression caused by climate stress can lead to pollination deficit. Pollinators are, indeed, quite sensitive to global changes. Furthermore, although species are connected by trophic links, all species respond differently to global changes. We highlight that more research is needed to elucidate the plant-mediated indirect effects of climate change on insects. Then, other human activities, such as land transformations and release of pollutants, are likely to modulate these links between climate and plant-insect relationships. We argue that predicting the net effect of global change on planteinsect relationships requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that modulate the interaction strength between the plants and the insects, rather than on focusing on each partner individually.",2017

Consideration is given to the concepts involved, available empirical information, and areas that warrant further research. Understanding the factors responsible for fire-stimulated flowering is limited. Studies suggest factors involved, but confounding of variables prevents their separation. Experiments evaluate different factors, but there have been few such studies and little consideration regarding soil attributes, synergistic effects of multiple factors, and large-scale factors such as herbivory, florivory, seed dispersal, and pollination. Understanding the adaptive nature, and hence evolution, of fire-stimulated flowering is poor. Prevalence of particular fire-related responses has been related to geographical and other patterns, with deduction of adaptive nature of plant responses to fire and factors driving evolution of these responses. However, confounding of factors hinders this approach and can lead to disagreement between researchers. A better approach would be to hypothesize that evolution has resulted in plant responses to fire that are Evolutionarily Stable Strategies and to develop consequent mathematical models for such evolution, leading to predictions and tests. However, this approach requires quantitative assessment of responses to fire-related factors and influences of such responses on plant fitness, and so far few such assessments exist. This poor state of knowledge regarding plants with fire-stimulated flowering means that we cannot easily replace or enhance fire for managing species with fire-stimulated flowering, as sometimes necessary, and it also restricts their commercial cultivation. Experimental evaluation of plant responses to fire and development of evolutionary models is required. Our knowledge of the factors that trigger post-fire flowering by re-sprouting plant species remains poor, and so we cannot incorporate relationships between them and plant fitness into mathematical models of plant evolution.",2017
Study of the dynamics of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) pollinators in three production systems,Insects; cocoa pollinators; production systems; crop management,,"This study aims to assess agro-ecological production systems, the dynamics of cocoa pollinating insects and their relationship with crop management and productivity. Three different production systems (conventional, organic and traditional), located in the province of Limon, Costa Rica, were chosen trying to find contrasts in their agricultural management. Sampling method was performed using manual aspirators. This technique allowed us to ensure catch insects directly from the flowers. According to different investigations [1] [2] [3], in cocoa, pollination is carried out almost exclusively by Diptera Micro Ceratopogonidae family, including Certain species of the genus Forcipomyia that are highly specialized to pollinate the cacao flowers due to the specific characteristics of the morphological structure of the insect. But our results did not show much presence of this family, only two specimens were found in the organic management system. Unlike species of the family Thysanoptera insects were found in greater amounts in each of the three systems. Species from Cecidoniidae and Sciaridae families were also found in the three systems. The traditional production system was the one that registered the highest number of insects, also recorded the highest numbers of flowers and fruits recorded. The organic production system was the one that registered fewer insects, flowers and fruits.",2017

One possibility to raise awareness for pollinator conservation is education. Unfortunately, insects such as bees are often perceived as frightening creatures; a negative emotion that may hinder successful learning processes. Thus, any educational initiative must conquer this obstacle and promote conservational knowledge. Using a quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the effectiveness of an educational programme using two student-centred learning approaches: One by encountering living honeybees (Apis mellifera) at a beehive (N=162), the other by using an eLearning tool connected to a remote beehive (N=192). We monitored secondary school students' environmentally relevant knowledge of bees, their environmental attitudes and their perception of bees in regard to conservation and dangerousness. The results indicate that both approaches lead to the acquisition of conservational knowledge in the short and medium term. Direct experiences with nature are regarded as crucial, but using an eLearning tool in environmental education constitutes an outstanding alternative to acquire knowledge. Adolescents with low green' attitudes responded positively to the online beehive, and the perceived danger of bees played no role in the learning process.",2017

Introduced bees can rapidly disrupt native plant pollinator mutualisms through competition with indigenous pollinator fauna and facilitation of invasive flora reproduction.

The small green carpenter bee Ceratina (Pithitis) smaragdula occurs throughout Southeast Asia and across the Hawaiian archipelago. Historical records indicate that C. smaragdula is nonnative to the Hawaiian archipelago and is recently introduced. Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of C. smaragdula's known biological and ecological history, as well as a population genetic analysis of C. smaragdula from Maui, and from locations across its native range, at the cytochrome oxidase I (C01) locus.

Multiple studies have demonstrated strong differential pollen placement by sympatric plant species under laboratory conditions; however, field evidence collected in natural settings is less common. Furthermore, it is unknown whether precise pollen placement on the pollinator's body remains constant throughout the foraging period, or if such patterns become diffused over time (e. g. due to grooming). To test the prevalence of differential pollen placement in the wild, we examined a community of five night-blooming plant species in southern Thailand that share common bat pollinators. Methods We mist-netted wild foraging nectar bats and collected pollen samples from four body parts: the crown of the head, face, chest and ventral side of one wing. We also noted the time of pollen collection to assess how pollinator pollen loads change throughout the foraging period. Key Results Our findings revealed that most of our plant study species placed pollen on precise areas of the bat, consistent with experimental work, and that patterns of differential pollen placement remained constant throughout the night. Conclusions This study demonstrates how diverse floral morphologies effectively limit interspecific pollen transfer among Old World bat-pollinated plants under natural conditions. Additionally, interspecific pollen transfer is probably minimal throughout the entire foraging period, since patterns of pollen on the bats' bodies were consistent over time.",2017
Model-based calculating tool for pollen-mediated gene flow frequencies in plants,Biosafety assessment; coexistence; isolation distance; modelling; pollen-mediated gene flow; seed production,RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; FARM SCALE SITES; CULTIVATED RICE; TRANSGENE FLOW; WILD RELATIVES; HERBICIDE RESISTANCE; WEEDY POPULATIONS; WINTER-WHEAT; OILSEED RAPE; CROPS,"The potential social-economic and environmental impacts caused by transgene flow from genetically engineered (GE) crops have stimulated worldwide biosafety concerns. To determine transgene flow frequencies resulted from pollination is the first critical step for assessing such impacts, in addition to the determination of transgene expression and fitness in crop-wild hybrid descendants. Two methods are commonly used to estimate pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) frequencies: field experimenting and mathematical modelling. Field experiments can provide relatively accurate results but are time/resource consuming. Modelling offers an effective complement for PMGF experimental assessment. However, many published models describe PMGF by mathematical equations and are practically not easy to use. To increase the application of PMGF modelling for the estimation of transgene flow, we established a tool to calculate PMGF frequencies based on a quasi-mechanistic PMGF model for wind-pollination species. This tool includes a calculating program displayed by an easy-operating interface. Pollen-mediated gene flow frequencies of different plant species can be quickly calculated under different environmental conditions by including a number of biological and wind speed parameters that can be measured in the fields/laboratories or obtained from published data. The tool is freely available in the public domain (http://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/userfiles/cn/files/Tool_Manual.zip (14 December 2016)). Case studies including rice, wheat and maize demonstrated similar results between the calculated frequencies based on this tool and those from published PMGF data. This PMGF calculating tool will provide useful information for assessing and monitoring social-economic and environmental impacts caused by transgene flow from GE crops. This tool can also be applied to determine the isolation distances between GE and non-GE crops in a coexistence agro-ecosystem, and to ensure the purity of certified seeds by setting proper isolation distances among field production plots.",2017

High levels of population differentiation in two New Caledonian Scaevola species (Goodeniaceae) and its implications for conservation prioritisation and restoration,breeding system; gene flow; spatial genetic structure; ultramafic,SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; PROTANDRY; PATTERNS; GENETICS; PACKAGE,"Population genetic structure was studied in two Scaevola (Goodeniaceae) species across their ranges in New Caledonia. Scaevola montana is locally common and distributed primarily on ultramafic substrates, and is used for ecological restoration of mining sites. Scaevola coccinea is a narrow endemic restricted to ultramafic soils in a single valley, where intensive mining activity occurs. We compared levels of diversity and differentiation in the two species using nuclear microsatellites, so as to understand the spatial scale at which populations become isolated. We also measured environmental distances among sites as a crude proxy to estimate where adaptive differentiation may occur. Populations of S. montana were sampled over a total distance of similar to 500 km. In contrast, the total range of S. coccinea is 12 x 6 km. Greater allelic diversity and gene diversity was detected within populations of S. montana than S. coccinea. Both species show high levels of population differentiation (S. montana F'(ST) = 0.437; S. coccinea F'(ST) = 0.54). The marked population structure in S. coccinea despite the close proximity of the sampled populations is associated with its pollination by territorial birds and no observed seed-dispersal agents, compared with the greater vagility of insect pollination and bird dispersal of S. montana. In S. coccinea, given the high levels of differentiation, we highlight the importance of each individual population for the conservation of intra-specific biodiversity in this species. In S. montana, we used a combination of the genetic data and environmental characteristics of each of the sample sites to outline general guidelines on seed sources for restoration programs.",2017
DYNAMICS OF SUNFLOWER RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOTA,sunflower; microbiota; rhizosphere; rhizoplane; hybrid; variety; line,SOIL; COMMUNITIES; BACTERIA; PLANTS,"Microflora dynamics analysis of the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of sunflower plant genotypes: varieties, hybrid, line was set out. It was found that the number of major ecological and trophic groups of microorganisms in rhizosphere and rhizoplane of sunflower depends on genotypic features of agriculture populations and transpiration of root exometabolites that determine the development and activity of trophic groups of microorganisms. Throughout the growing season of sunflower (the phase of ""4-6 leaves"" to the maturation phase) we observed the qualitative changes in the composition of the microbiota. In the rhizosphere of hybrid, the microcenosis structure was the most stable, whereas the rhizosphere of crop culture had different dynamics during crop ontogeny. The depressive effect of root exometabolites was connected with genotypic features of the line regards the microflora of rhizosphere and rhizoplane. These features can be used in the F-1 hybrids cultivation and primary seed production of self-pollinated homozygous lines.",2017

All animals, including bees, are associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the micro biome. The bee micro biome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further, the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the bee micro biome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment of the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated, and analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this end, the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would provide reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources. The goal would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing primary data from different research programs, thus furthering our understanding of the bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health.",2016

However, the implications of phenology to environmental conservation and management remain poorly explored. Here, we present the first explicit appraisal of how phenology a multidisciplinary science encompassing biometeorology, ecology, and evolutionary biology can make a key contribution to contemporary conservation biology. We focus on shifts in plant phenology induced by global change, their impacts on species diversity and plant-animal interactions in the tropics, and how conservation efforts could be enhanced in relation to plant resource organization. We identify the effects of phenological changes and mismatches in the maintenance and conservation of mutualistic interactions, and examine how phenological research can contribute to evaluate, manage and mitigate the consequences of land-use change and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as fire, exotic and invasive species. We also identify cutting-edge tools that can improve the spatial and temporal coverage of phonological monitoring, from satellites to drones and digital cameras. We highlight the role of historical information in recovering long-term phenological time series, and track climate-related shifts in tropical systems. Finally, we propose a set of measures to boost the contribution of phonology to conservation science. We advocate the inclusion of phenology into predictive models integrating evolutionary history to identify species groups that are either resilient or sensitive to future climate-change scenarios, and understand how phenological mismatches can affect community dynamics, ecosystem services, and conservation over time.

Investing in the transition to sustainable agriculture,Diversified farming systems; Ecosystem services; Agroecology; Agriculture policy; Agricultural research; Sustainability,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FOOD SECURITY; INTENSIFICATION; AGROECOLOGY,"Ecogical impacts of industrial agriculture include significant greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity, widespread pollution by fertilizers and pesticides, soil loss and degradation, declining pollinators, and human health risks, among many others. A rapidly growing body of scientific research, however, suggests that farming systems designed and managed according to ecological principles can meet the food needs of society while addressing these pressing environmental and social issues. The promise of such systems implies an urgent need for increasing the scope and scale of this area of research - agroecology. Notably, agroecological systems have been shown to reduce input dependency and therefore related research is unlikely to be supported by the private sector. Yet, the amount of federal funding available for agroecology has remained unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, we identified projects beginning in 2014 from the USDA Current Research Information System (CRIS) database and searched key sections of project reports for major components emphasizing sustainable agriculture, including agroecology. Components were grouped into four levels according to their focus on: improving system efficiency to reduce the use of inputs (L1), substituting more sustainable inputs and practices into farming systems (L2), redesigning systems based on ecological principles (L3: agroecology), or reestablishing connections between producers and consumers to support a socio-ecological transformation of the food system (L4: social dimensions of agroecology). We identified 824 projects, which accounted for $294 million dollars: just over 10% of the entire 2014 USDA Research, Extension, and Economics (REE) budget. Using a highly conservative classification protocol, we found that the primary focus of many projects was unrelated to sustainable agriculture at any level, but the majority of projects had at least one relevant component (representing 52-69% of analyzed funds, depending on whether projects focused exclusively on increasing yields were included). Of the total $294 million of analyzed funds, 18-36% went to projects that included a L1 component. Projects including components in L2, L3, or L4 received just 24%, 15%, and 14% of analyzed funds, respectively. Systems-based projects that included both agroecological farming practices (L3) and support for socioeconomic sustainability (L4) were particularly poorly funded (4%), as were L3 projects that included complex rotations (3%), spatially diversified farms (3%), rotational or regenerative grazing (1%), integrated crop-livestock systems (1%), or agroforestry (<1%). We estimated that projects with an emphasis on agroecology, indicated by those with a minimum or overall level of 13, represented 5-10% of analyzed funds (equivalent to only 0.6-1.5% of the 2014 REE budget). Results indicate that increased funding is urgently needed for REE, especially for systems-based research in biologically diversified farming and ranching systems.",2016

Plant reproduction of most angiosperm species is mediated by pollinators, and the effects of herbivore induced plant defences on pollinator behaviour have been largely neglected. Moreover, there is expected to be a trade-off between plant reproductive strategies and defence mechanisms. To investigate this trade-off, it is essential to study herbivore-induced plant resistance and allocation of resources by plants, within the same system, and to test if indirect plant resistance can conflict with pollinator attraction. Here, I review the key literature highlighting connection between plant defence and reproduction, and propose to exploit natural variation among plant species to assess the ecological costs of plant responses to herbivores and pollinators.",2016
Lost colonies found in a data mine: Global honey trade but not pests or pesticides as a major cause of regional honeybee colony declines,Socioeconomics; Honey; Global trade; Colony losses; Beekeeping,COLLAPSE DISORDER; WILD POLLINATORS; DRIVERS; EUROPE,"Recent losses of honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies have been linked to several non-exclusive factors; such as pests, parasites, pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoids) and other toxins. Whereas these losses pose a threat to apiculture, the number of globally managed colonies appeared to be less affected because beekeepers replace lost colonies. From a socioeconomic and ecological perspective the number of managed colonies is arguably more relevant when addressing the issue of apiculture and pollination services provided by honeybees. We here use the FAO data base to dissect the interactions between the global honey market and the number of colonies. Global scale analyses do not show a general colony decline. Whereas Western Europe and the US show suffer colony declines, other regions show considerable increase. We could not find any link between the colony dynamics and the occurrence of specific pathogens or the use of pesticides. In contrast, changes in the political and socioeconomic system show strong effects on apiculture. In addition, many countries show a tight negative correlation between honey import and the number of managed colonies. For some countries, the amount of honey produced per colony is highly positively correlated with the amount of honey imports, and we cannot exclude large scale relabeling of imported to nationally produced honey. It is very clear that honey trade is a dominating factor for the number of managed colonies since countries with a strong import and export ratio are those suffering most strongly from colony declines.

Ecosystem services as assessment endpoints for ecological risk assessment,Assessment endpoints; Ecological risk assessment; Ecosystem services; Generic ecological assessment endpoints,FRAMEWORK,"Ecosystem services are defined as the outputs of ecological processes that contribute to human welfare or have the potential to do so in the future. Those outputs include food and drinking water, clean air and water, and pollinated crops. The need to protect the services provided by natural systems has been recognized previously, but ecosystem services have not been formally incorporated into ecological risk assessment practice in a general way in the United States. Endpoints used conventionally in ecological risk assessment, derived directly from the state of the ecosystem (e.g., biophysical structure and processes), and endpoints based on ecosystem services serve different purposes. Conventional endpoints are ecologically important and susceptible entities and attributes that are protected under US laws and regulations. Ecosystem service endpoints are a conceptual and analytical step beyond conventional endpoints and are intended to complement conventional endpoints by linking and extending endpoints to goods and services with more obvious benefit to humans. Conventional endpoints can be related to ecosystem services even when the latter are not considered explicitly during problem formulation. To advance the use of ecosystem service endpoints in ecological risk assessment, the US Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Assessment Forum has added generic endpoints based on ecosystem services (ES-GEAE) to the original 2003 set of generic ecological assessment endpoints (GEAEs). Like conventional GEAEs, ES-GEAEs are defined by an entity and an attribute. Also like conventional GEAEs, ES-GEAEs are broadly described and will need to be made specific when applied to individual assessments. Adoption of ecosystem services as a type of assessment endpoint is intended to improve the value of risk assessment to environmental decision making, linking ecological risk to human well-being, and providing an improved means of communicating those risks.

The most common trading coin that plants offer to pay for animal services is nectar; the main servers are hymenopterans. Extrafloral nectar (EFN) is produced in almost all aboveground plant parts not directly related with pollination, and their true function has long been an issue of discussion among naturalists and will be our main subject. The protective function of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) is reviewed and considered with an alternative hypothesis, presenting not only ants, but also spiders and wasps as potential and effective agents in these protective interactions. Despite their likely relevance, the phenological variation (mainly sequential flowering and resprouting) of host plants mediating these interactions have been generally ignored. We discuss how the outcomes of each ant-EFN bearing plant interaction vary depending on physical and biotic changes in interacting organisms (internal factors such as phenology and species identity) as well as in their environments (external factors such as climatic variation), all of which may modify the character of each interaction. We propose that ant-EFN bearing plant interactions serve an excellent and unique model to test the ""Geographic Mosaic Theory"" of coevolution providing us a more clear view of how evolution has structured these plant-animal ecological networks.",2016
On-farm habitat restoration counters biotic homogenization in intensively managed agriculture,#NAME?,FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDEXES; WILD BEE POLLINATORS; BETA-DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; LAND-USE; CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; PLANT-COMMUNITIES,"To slow the rate of global species loss, it is imperative to understand how to restore and maintain native biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial heterogeneity and turnover in community composition (-diversity). While some techniques are known to enhance -diversity, it is unclear whether habitat restoration can re-establish -diversity. Using a long-term pollinator dataset, comprising approximate to 9,800 specimens collected from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central Valley of California, we show that on-farm habitat restoration in the form of native plant hedgerows', when replicated across a landscape, can boost -diversity by approximately 14% relative to unrestored field margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows restore -diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological filter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small-scale restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.",2016

Owing to genetic variation in pathogen virulence, a complete understanding of species decline requires the accurate identification and characterization of EIDs. We explore this issue in the Western honeybee, where increasing mortality of populations in the Northern Hemisphere has caused major concern. Specifically, we investigate the importance of genetic identity of the main suspect in mortality, deformed wing virus (DWV), in driving honeybee loss. Using laboratory experiments and a systematic field survey, we demonstrate that an emerging DWV genotype (DWV-B) is more virulent than the established DWV genotype (DWV-A) and is widespread in the landscape. Furthermore, we show in a simple model that colonies infected with DWV-B collapse sooner than colonies infected with DWV-A. We also identify potential for rapid DWV evolution by revealing extensive genome-wide recombination in vivo. The emergence of DWV-B in naive honeybee populations, including via recombination with DWV-A, could be of significant ecological and economic importance. Our findings emphasize that knowledge of pathogen genetic identity and diversity is critical to understanding drivers of species decline.",2016

We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.",2016
Morphology predicts species' functional roles and their degree of specialization in plant-frugivore interactions,ecological networks; fleshy-fruited plants; frugivorous birds; functional diversity; mutualistic interactions; traits,FRUIT-EATING BIRDS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SEED-DISPERSAL; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; FOOD-WEB; TRAITS; SIZE; BIODIVERSITY,"Species' functional roles in key ecosystem processes such as predation, pollination or seed dispersal are determined by the resource use of consumer species. An interaction between resource and consumer species usually requires trait matching (e.g. a congruence in the morphologies of interaction partners). Species' morphology should therefore determine species' functional roles in ecological processes mediated by mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. We tested this assumption for Neotropical plant-bird mutualisms. We used a new analytical framework that assesses a species's functional role based on the analysis of the traits of its interaction partners in a multidimensional trait space. We employed this framework to test (i) whether there is correspondence between the morphology of bird species and their functional roles and (ii) whether morphologically specialized birds fulfil specialized functional roles. We found that morphological differences between bird species reflected their functional differences: (i) bird species with different morphologies foraged on distinct sets of plant species and (ii) morphologically distinct bird species fulfilled specialized functional roles. These findings encourage further assessments of species' functional roles through the analysis of their interaction partners, and the proposed analytical framework facilitates a wide range of novel analyses for network and community ecology.",2016

Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of bio-diversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. 2. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. 3. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. 4. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator-prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore-plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant-pollinator systems). 5. Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.",2016
Chronic neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and parasite stress differentially affects learning in honeybees and bumblebees,Apis mellifera; Bombus terrestris; clothianidin; Nosema ceranae; pollination; proboscis extension response,NOSEMA-CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; BEE APIS-MELLIFERA; PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; FORAGING SUCCESS; WILD POLLINATORS; MEMORY; MECHANISMS; INFECTION; FORAGERS,"Learning and memory are crucial functions which enable insect pollinators to efficiently locate and extract floral rewards. Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to field realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others. This has important implications for regulatory risk assessments which generally use honeybees as a model for all bees.",2016

We used random matrix theory-based network analysis of 16S rRNA genes to identify bacterial networks associated with wild oat (Avena fatua) over two seasons in greenhouse microcosms. Rhizosphere networks were substantially more complex than those in surrounding soils, indicating the rhizosphere has a greater potential for interactions and niche-sharing. Network complexity increased as plants grew, even as diversity decreased, highlighting that community organisation is not captured by univariate diversity. Covariations were predominantly positive (>80%), suggesting that extensive mutualistic interactions may occur among rhizosphere bacteria; we identified quorum-based signalling as one potential strategy. Putative keystone taxa often had low relative abundances, suggesting low-abundance taxa may significantly contribute to rhizosphere function. Network complexity, a previously undescribed property of the rhizosphere microbiome, appears to be a defining characteristic of this habitat.",2016

To estimate the consequences of these shifts for the functioning and stability of ecosystems, reliable predictions of alterations in species distributions are needed. Projections with correlative species distribution models, which correlate species' distributions to the abiotic environment, have become a standard approach. Criticism of this approach centres around the omission of relevant biotic feedbacks and triggered the search for alternatives. A new generation of mechanistic process-based species distribution models aims at implementing formulations of relevant biotic processes to cover species' life histories, physiology, dispersal abilities, evolution, and both intra- and interspecific interactions. Although this step towards more structural realism is considered important, it remains unclear whether the resulting projections are more reliable. Structural realism has the advantage that geographic range shifting emerges from the interplay of relevant abiotic and biotic processes. Having implemented the relevant response mechanisms, structural realistic models should better tackle the challenge of generating projections of species responses to (non-analogous) environmental change. However, reliable projections of future species ranges demand ecological information that is currently only available for few species. In this opinion paper, we discuss how the discrepancy between demand for structural realism on the one hand and the related knowledge gaps on the other hand affects the reliability of mechanistic species distribution models. We argue that omission of relevant processes potentially impairs projection accuracy (proximity of the mean outcome to the true value), particularly if species range shifts emerge from species and community dynamics. Yet, insufficient knowledge that limits model specification and parameterization, as well as process complexity, increases projection uncertainty (variance in the outcome of simulated model projections). The accuracy-uncertainty-relation reflects current limits to delivering reliable projections of range shifts. We propose a protocol to improve and communicate projection reliability. The protocol combines modelling and empirical research to efficiently fill critical knowledge gaps that currently limit the reliability of species and community projections.    ",2016

Uncovering the causal relationship between abundance and generalisation has been hindered by a chicken-and-egg dilemma: is generalisation a by-product of being abundant, or does high abundance result from generalisation? Here, we analyse a database of plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser networks, and provide strong evidence that the causal link between abundance and generalisation is uni-directional. Specifically, species appear to be generalists because they are more abundant, but the converse, that is that species become more abundant because they are generalists, is not supported by our analysis. Furthermore, null model analyses suggest that abundant species interact with many other species simply because they are more likely to encounter potential interaction partners.",2016

Virtually all empirical ecological interaction networks to some extent suffer from undersampling. However, how limitations imposed by sampling incompleteness affect our understanding of ecological networks is still poorly explored, which may hinder further advances in the field. 2. Here, we use a plant-hummingbird network with unprecedented sampling effort (2716 h of focal observations) from the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, to investigate how sampling effort affects the description of network structure (i.e. widely used network metrics) and the relative importance of distinct processes (i.e. species abundances vs. traits) in determining the frequency of pairwise interactions. 3. By dividing the network into time slices representing a gradient of sampling effort, we show that quantitative metrics, such as interaction evenness, specialization (H-2'), weighted nestedness (wNODF) and modularity (Q; QuanBiMo algorithm) were less biased by sampling incompleteness than binary metrics. Furthermore, the significance of some network metrics changed along the sampling effort gradient. Nevertheless, the higher importance of traits in structuring the network was apparent even with small sampling effort. 4. Our results (i) warn against using very poorly sampled networks as this may bias our understanding of networks, both their patterns and structuring processes, (ii) encourage the use of quantitative metrics little influenced by sampling when performing spatio-temporal comparisons and (iii) indicate that in networks strongly constrained by species traits, such as plant-hummingbird networks, even small sampling is sufficient to detect their relative importance for the frequencies of interactions. Finally, we argue that similar effects of sampling are expected for other highly specialized subnetworks.",2016

However, the most important parameter for queen production was the colony growth rate per flower, as opposed to the average number of available flowers. This result indicates the importance of understanding mechanisms of colony growth, in order to predict queen production and enhance bumble bee population viability.

However, its phylogeny and evolution of mouthparts among other issues remain debatable. Here new methods of preparation permitted the comprehensive anatomical description of insect inclusions from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber in astonishing detail. These ""missing links"" fossils, attributed to a new order Permopsocida, provide crucial evidence for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships in the Acercaria, supporting its monophyly, and questioning the position of Psocodea as sister group of holometabolans in the most recent phylogenomic study. Permopsocida resolves as sister group of Thripida + Hemiptera and represents an evolutionary link documenting the transition from chewing to piercing mouthparts in relation to suction feeding. Identification of gut contents as angiosperm pollen documents an ecological role of Permopsocida as early pollen feeders with relatively unspecialized mouthparts. This group existed for 185 million years, but has never been diverse and was superseded by new pollenivorous pollinators during the Cretaceous co-evolution of insects and flowers. The key innovation of suction feeding with piercing mouthparts is identified as main event that triggered the huge post-Carboniferous radiation of hemipterans, and facilitated the spreading of pathogenic vectors.",2016

Less appreciated is that hybridization between local and introduced bees can lead to genomic extinction of indigenous bee taxa and to a loss in overall biodiversity. More directly, mating interference between introduced and native bees may result in reduced reproductive success of the indigenous taxa. It is therefore important that the benefits of introducing exotic bee species be carefully weighed against the possible costs to indigenous populations.",2016

Significant advances in both mathematical and molecular approaches in ecology offer unprecedented opportunities to describe and understand ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks describe interactions between species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge. 2. Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto difficult to observe species interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems that are resilient to environmental change. 3. We propose a novel 'nested tagging' metabarcoding approach for the rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks. Taking tree-insect-parasitoid ecological networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness, constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest management. 4. Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date, providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to environmental change.",2016

These VOCs are part of ecologically relevant public information that serve as cues attracting blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae), such as Lucilia sericata, to remains as a resource both for themselves and for their offspring. However, these responses are partially governed by sex and physiological state (e.g. gravid and nongravid) of the fly and concentration of the VOCs. We examined the responses of 7-9-day-old L. sericata adults to dimethyldisulphide, indole, isobutylamine and phenylacetic acid in a Y-tube olfactometer. These VOCs are associated with vertebrate decomposition, carrion-mimicking flowers as well as fly-attracting bacteria. Our results demonstrate a relationship between sex and physiological state with regard to dose-dependent attraction to VOCs that occur during decomposition, suggesting that specific decomposition molecules provide distinct types of information to the flies with differing foraging interests. Understanding this dynamic relationship provides insight into the mechanisms regulating arthropod colonization, competition and resulting succession in association with such ephemeral resources.",2016

Although increasingly appreciated for their agricultural contributions, relatively little is yet known about the natural history of the vast majority of the more than 20000 wild bee species worldwide. The small carpenter bee genus Ceratina occurs globally, and is represented in North America by its most recently diverged subgenera, Ceratinula and Zadontomerus. Recent genetic analysis of eastern Ceratina (Zadontomerus) supports the existence of five closely related, yet genetically distinct species living in sympatry. This phylogeographical study employs molecular barcoding of the most comprehensive specimen collection yet assembled to confirm the identities of these recently diverged eastern North American Ceratina (Zadontomerus) species. Delineation of extant population structure, evolutionary history and known range of this emerging model native pollinator are greatly improved by this study. We consider ecological and behavioural factors potentially contributing to the maintenance of genetic identity among these sympatric species.",2016
Nectar chemistry mediates the behavior of parasitized bees: consequences for plant fitness,bees; iridoid glycosides; multispecies interactions; parasitism; parasitoids; pollination; secondary metabolites,FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; IRIDOID GLYCOSIDES; BUMBLE BEES; EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES; CATALPA-SPECIOSA; CHEMICAL DEFENSE; DIGGING BEHAVIOR; SELF-MEDICATION; FLOWER CHOICE; TOXIC NECTAR,"Plants produce an array of secondary metabolites that play important ecological roles as anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen defenses. Many herbivores experience physiological costs when they consume secondary metabolites, yet some also benefit, for example when these chemicals confer resistance to parasites and predators. Secondary metabolites are often present in nectar and pollen, which is paradoxical given that floral rewards are important in the attraction of mutualists rather than deterrence of antagonists. Motivated by studies of interactions among plants, herbivores, and parasites, as well as research showing that secondary metabolites can reduce bee disease, we characterized the occurrence of two iridoid glycosides, aucubin and catalpol, in floral rewards and other tissues of the bee pollinated plant, Chelone glabra. We then experimentally investigated effects of nectar iridoid glycoside concentrations on the foraging behavior of bumble bee pollinators naturally afflicted by a parasitoid fly and a protozoan intestinal parasite, and subsequent effects on an estimate of plant reproduction. We found that floral nectar had lower iridoid glycoside concentrations than leaves, pollen, and corollas, and that, compared to those plant parts, the relative ratio of the two primary iridoid glycosides, aucubin and catalpol, was reversed in nectar. Whether bees carried parasitoid fly larvae did not affect their response to nectar chemistry; however, there was a significant interaction between protozoan parasite infection and nectar treatment, with infected bees foraging longer at flowers with high compared to low nectar iridoid glycoside concentrations. Parasitized bees were also more likely to return to inflorescences with high iridoid glycoside nectar. Consequently, flowers in the high iridoid glycoside nectar treatment donated significantly more pollen to conspecific stigmas than did flowers in the low iridoid glycoside treatment, suggesting an increase in male plant fitness. Taken together, these results demonstrate that nectar secondary metabolites can mediate the behavior of pollinators with subsequent benefits for estimates of plant reproduction.",2016

Floral volatiles are often species specific, yet highly variable and sensitive to environmental factors. To date, nothing is known about the heritability of floral volatiles, and whether individual compounds can evolve independently or solely in concert with the whole volatile bouquet. We conducted bi-directional artificial selection on four target floral volatiles to estimate heritability and correlated pleiotropic responses in the wild turnip (Brassica rapa). The realized heritability of the four target volatiles ranged from 20% to 45%. The average narrow-sense heritability of all 13 analyzed floral volatiles was 18% based on parent-offspring regressions. There were pleiotropic effects of the selected floral volatile compounds on other constituents of the floral scent bouquet, on flowering time and on some morphological traits. We found that the whole floral scent bouquet changed, even when there was selection only on single compounds, with the overall phenotypic covariance being unaffected. Our study demonstrates that floral scent can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection, but with additional correlated responses in traits that are not direct targets of selection.",2016

These associations may, in turn, impact native species interaction networks as non-natives become dominant in their new environments. Using phylogenetic and ecological interaction network approaches we provide the first report of the structure of belowground legume-rhizobium interaction networks and how they change along a gradient of invasion (uninvaded, semi invaded and heavily invaded sites) by Australian Acacia species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We found that native and invasive legumes interact with distinct rhizobial lineages, most likely due to phylogenetic uniqueness of native and invasive host plants. Moreover, legume-rhizobium interaction networks are not nested, but significantly modular with high levels of specialization possibly as a result of legume-rhizobium co-evolution. Although network topology remained constant across the invasion gradient, composition of bacterial communities associated with native legumes changed dramatically as acacias increasingly dominated the landscape. In stark contrast to aboveground interaction networks (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal) we show that invasive legumes do not infiltrate existing native legume-rhizobium networks but rather form novel modules. This absence of mutualist overlap between native and invasive legumes suggests the importance of co-invading rhizobium-acacia species complexes for Acacia invasion success, and argues against a ubiquitous role for the formation and evolutionary refinement of novel interactions.",2016

Unknown impacts of scale are among several factors that complicate research. This study models ecosystem services in the urban area comprising the towns of Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton which together represent a wide range of the urban forms present in the UK. Objectives The objectives of this study were to test (1) the sensitivity of ecosystem service model outputs to the spatial resolution of input data, and (2) whether any resultant scale dependency is constant across different ecosystem services and model approaches (e.g. stock-versus flow-based). Methods Carbon storage, sediment erosion, and pollination were modelled with the InVEST framework using input data representative of common coarse (25 m) and fine (5 m) spatial resolutions. Results Fine scale analysis generated higher estimates of total carbon storage (9.32 vs. 7.17 kg m(-2)) and much lower potential sediment erosion estimates (6.4 vs. 18.1 Mg km(-2) year(-1)) than analyses conducted at coarser resolutions; however coarse-scale analysis estimated more abundant pollination service provision. Conclusions Scale sensitivities depend on the type of service being modelled; stock estimates (e.g. carbon storage) are most sensitive to aggregation across scales, dynamic flow models (e.g. sediment erosion) are most sensitive to spatial resolution, and ecological process models involving both stocks and dynamics (e.g. pollination) are sensitive to both. Care must be taken to select model data appropriate to the scale of inquiry.",2016

Although biparental inbreeding is likely to influence the dynamics of inbreeding depression and the evolution of selfing rates, it has received limited theoretical attention in comparison to selfing. The only previous model suggested that biparental inbreeding can favour the maintenance of stable intermediate selfing rates, but made unrealistic assumptions about the genetic basis of inbreeding depression. Here we extend a genetic model of inbreeding depression, describing nearly recessive lethal mutations at a very large number of loci, to incorporate sib-mating. We also include a constant component of inbreeding depression modelling the effects of mildly deleterious, nearly additive alleles. We analyze how observed rates of sib-mating influence the mean number of heterozygous lethals alleles and inbreeding depression in a population reproducing by a mixture of self-fertilization, sib-mating and outcrossing. We finally use the ensuing relationship between equilibrium inbreeding depression and population selfing rate to infer the evolutionarily stable selfing rates expected under such a mixed mating system. Results: We show that for a given rate of inbreeding, sib-mating is more efficient at purging inbreeding depression than selfing, because homozygosity of lethals increases more gradually through sib-mating than through selfing. Because sib-mating promotes the purging of inbreeding depression and the evolution of selfing, our genetic model of inbreeding depression also predicts that sib-mating is unlikely to maintain stable intermediate selfing rates. Conclusions: Our results imply that even low rates of sib-mating affect plant mating system evolution, by facilitating the evolution of selfing via more efficient purging of inbreeding depression. Alternative mechanisms, such as pollination ecology, are necessary to explain stable mixed selfing and outcrossing.",2016
Linking structure and functionality in mutualistic networks: do core frugivores disperse more seeds than peripheral species?,,POLLINATION NETWORKS; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; FRUIT-REMOVAL; PLANT; BIRDS; ARGENTINA; SERVICES; FOREST; RAIN; SPECIALIZATION,"Seed dispersal networks are often organized in nested structures in a way that a few core species can disproportionally affect the remaining species in a network, in both the ecological and evolutionary sense. Yet, the relative importance of core and peripheral species has not been properly tested in seed dispersal network studies. We determined core species from 10 local seed dispersal networks composed by fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds. Each of those local quantitative networks was characterized with a core quality value, a core score for each species and a threshold value between core and peripheral species. From a total of 52 bird and 69 plant species that interacted in the study area, only 8 and 15, respectively, were identified as core. Each local network had a core that comprised a small number of birds and plants, always lower than 30% of the interacting species. There was no difference in the quantitative component of seed dispersal effectiveness (QC) provided by the frugivorous bird assemblage to plant functional groups clustered according to their growth form and fruit characteristics. Core birds dispersed seeds from each of these plant functional groups with a higher QC than peripheral species. Thus, we empirically demonstrate for the first time that seed dispersal networks at a regional scale have a small core set of fruit-eating birds, upon which heavily rely most fleshy-fruited plants for their seed removal. Hence, the activity of just a few core frugivores could deeply impact the demography of an entire assemblage of fleshy-fruited plants.",2016

Urban green spaces operate as small-scale nodes in larger networks of ecological reserves that provide and maintain key ecosystem services such as pollination, water retention and infiltration, and sustainable food production. In an urban mosaic, a myriad of social and ecological components factor into aggregating and managing land to maintain or increase the flow of ecosystem services associated with green spaces. Vacant lots (a form of urban green space) are being repurposed for multiple functions, such as habitat for biodiversity, including arthropods that provide pollination services to other green areas; to capture urban runoff that eases the burden on ageing wastewater systems and other civic infrastructure; and to reduce urban heat island effects. Because of the uncertainty and complexities of managing for ecosystem services in urban settings, we advocate for a governance approach that is adaptive and iterative in nature-adaptive governance-to address the ever changing social order underlying post-industrial cities and offer the rise of land banks as an example of governance innovation.",2016

Genetic studies are increasingly undertaken but results from such studies are still rarely implemented as management actions in the field. We address this 'research-implementation gap' by developing a plain-language genetic assessment approach for population-level conservation prioritization based on measurement of key genetic parameters. Our aim was to improve understanding between conservation researchers and practitioners, enabling practitioners to incorporate genetic information into conservation actions and conservation genetic researchers to address research explicitly resulting in conservation action. Location Applicable globally. Methods We derived a decision-making framework that identifies appropriate management strategies for threatened populations based on the level of genetic differentiation (F-ST), genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity, H-E) and inbreeding (F-IS), characterized as 'high' or 'low' in comparison with a reference benchmark. We demonstrate the application of the framework in two case studies of threatened plants and more broadly from the literature. Results Applying the decision framework, we found that for Prostanthera eurybioides, the population of conservation concern does not currently require specialized genetic management and mitigation of ecological threats should be prioritized instead. For Allocasuarina robusta, we found connectivity was high and strategies should be put in place to maintain gene flow. In both cases, genetic information was important for designing restocking strategies accounting for the genetic structure and genetic diversity of source and recipient populations. From the literature, key examples of species types that fit each of the genetic management scenarios are given. Main conclusions We find that the application of our simplified genetic assessment framework helps to clarify management actions based on conservation genetic information for threatened flora, and should assist in bridging the gap between researchers and conservation practitioners for integrated conservation outcomes. Our framework could equally apply to fauna conservation with appropriate consideration of animal-specific management issues.",2016

Despite the ecological and economic importance of bats and birds in tropical forests, a.grotbrestry systems, and agricultural systems mixed with natural forest, a systematic review of their impact is still missing. A growing number of bird and bat exclosure experiments has improved our knowledge allowing new conclusions regarding their roles in food Webs and associated ecosystem seivices. Here, 1,ye review the distribution patterns of insectivorous birds and bats, their local and landscape drivers, and their effects on trophic cascades in tropical ecosystems. We report that for birds but not bats comanmity composition and relative importance of functional groups changes conspicuously from forests to habitats including both agricultural areas and forests, here termed 'forest-agri' habitats, with reduced representation of insectivores in the latter. In contrast to previous theory regarding trophic cascade strength, we find that birds and bats reduce the density and biomass of arthropods in the tropics with effect sizes similar to those in temperate and boreal communities. The relative importance of birds versus bats in regulating pest abundances varies with s(ason, geography and management. Birds and bats may even suppress tropical arthropod outbreaks, although positive effects on plant growth are not always report,ed. As both bats and birds are major ag,ents of pest suppression, a better understanding of the local and landscape factoi-s driving the variability of their impact is needed.",2016

In a phylogenetic comparative framework, an evolutionary dead end may be detectable from the phylogenetic distribution of specialists, if specialists rarely give rise to large, diverse clades. Previous phylogenetic studies of the influence of specialization on macroevolutionary processes have demonstrated a range of patterns, including examples where specialists have both higher and lower diversification rates than generalists, as well as examples where the rates of evolutionary transitions from generalists to specialists are higher, lower or equal to transitions from specialists to generalists. Here, we wish to ask whether these varied answers are due to the differences in macroevolutionary processes in different clades, or partly due to differences in methodology. We analysed ten phylogenies containing multiple independent origins of specialization and quantified the phylogenetic distribution of specialists by applying a common set of metrics to all datasets. We compared the tip branch lengths of specialists to generalists, the size of specialist clades arising from each evolutionary origin of a specialized trait and whether specialists tend to be clustered or scattered on phylogenies. For each of these measures, we compared the observed values to expectations under null models of trait evolution and expected outcomes under alternative macroevolutionary scenarios. We found that specialization is sometimes an evolutionary dead end: in two of the ten case studies (pollinator-specific plants and host-specific flies), specialization is associated with a reduced rate of diversification or trait persistence. However, in the majority of studies, we could not distinguish the observed phylogenetic distribution of specialists from null models in which specialization has no effect on diversification or trait persistence.",2016
Flower Iridescence Increases Object Detection in the Insect Visual System without Compromising Object Identity,,BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT CUE; FLORAL IRIDESCENCE; COLOR DISCRIMINATION; STRUCTURAL COLOR; BUMBLEBEES; BEETLES; POLLINATORS,"Iridescence is a form of structural coloration, produced by a range of structures, in which hue is dependent on viewing angle [1-4]. One of these structures, the diffraction grating, is found both in animals (for example, beetles [2]) and in plants (on the petals of some animal pollinated flowers [5]). The behavioral impacts of floral iridescence and its potential ecological significance are unknown [6-9]. Animal-pollinated flowers are described as ""sensory billboards'' [10], with many floral features contributing to a conspicuous display that filters prospective pollinators. Yet floral iridescence is more subtle to the human eye than that of many animal displays because the floral diffraction grating is not perfectly regular [5-9]. This presents a puzzle: if the function of petals is to attract pollinators, then flowers might be expected to optimize iridescence to increase showiness. On the other hand, pollinators memorize floral colors as consistent advertisements of reward quality, and iridescence might corrupt flower color identity. Here we tested the trade-off between flower detectability and recognition, requiring bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to identify artificial flowers that varied in pigmentation and degree of iridescence. We find that iridescence does increase target detectability but that ""perfect'' iridescence (produced by an artificial diffraction grating) corrupts target identity and bees make many mistakes. However, ""imperfect'' floral iridescence does not lead to mistaken target identity, while still benefitting flower detectability. We hypothesize that similar trade-offs might be found in the many naturally ""imperfect'' iridescence-producing structures found in animal-animal, as well as other plant-animal, interactions.",2016

Extant papilionoid butterflies (Lepidoptera) probably originated 80-70 Ma, long after kalligrammatids became extinct. Although poor preservation of kalligrammatid fossils previously prevented their detailed morphological and ecological characterization, we examine new, well-preserved, kalligrammatid fossils from Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sites in northeastern China to unravel a surprising array of similar morphological and ecological features in these two, unrelated clades. We used polarized light and epifluorescence photography, SEM imaging, energy dispersive spectrometry and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to examine kalligrammatid fossils and their environment. We mapped the evolution of specific traits onto a kalligrammatid phylogeny and discovered that these extinct lacewings convergently evolved wing eyespots that possibly contained melanin, and wing scales, elongate tubular proboscides, similar feeding styles, and seed-plant associations, similar to butterflies. Long-proboscid kalligrammatid lacewings lived in ecosystems with gymnosperm-insect relationships and likely accessed bennettitalean pollination drops and pollen.

Yet, positive and negative interactions have mostly been treated independently, owing partly to disciplinary silos in ecological and agricultural sciences. We advocate a new integrated research paradigm that explicitly recognizes cost-benefit trade-offs among animal activities and acknowledges that these activities occur within social-ecological contexts. Support for this paradigm is presented in an evidence-based conceptual model structured around five evidence statements highlighting emerging trends applicable to sustainable agriculture. The full range of benefits and costs associated with animal activities in agroecosystems cannot be quantified by focusing on single species groups, crops, or systems. Management of productive agroecosystems should sustain cycles of ecological interactions between crops and wild animals, not isolate these cycles from the system. Advancing this paradigm will therefore require integrated studies that determine net returns of animal activity in agroecosystems.",2016

Bipartite networks are ubiquitous in community ecology, including examples of facilitative interactions, such as plant-pollinator networks, and antagonistic interactions, such as virus-host infection networks. Statistical network analysis is increasingly used to identify emergent, nonrandom patterns of interaction and the effect of interaction patterns on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Two recurring patterns are that of modularity and nestedness. Modularity is a feature of networks in which there are densely interacting subgroups. Nestedness is a feature of networks in which the interactions form ordered subsets. 2. Here we describe BiMat, an open-source MATLAB package for the study of the structure of bipartite ecological networks. Unlike alternative tools, BiMat enables both multiscale analysis of the structure of a bipartite ecological network - spanning global (i.e. entire network) to local (i.e. module-level) scales - and meta-analyses of many bipartite networks simultaneously. In common with other tools, BiMat calculates the degree to which a bipartite network is modular and/or nested, the statistical significance of these patterns, and enables visualization of latent structures in the network. 3.

For the highly diverse orchid family, many species face imminent extinction. Successful re-introductions that result in self-sustaining populations require not only an understanding of existing threats, but an in-depth understanding of species ecology. Increasingly, translocations, ranging from re-introductions to assisted colonisation, are being adopted as recovery actions. Do these translocations mitigate threatening processes and account for the two key ecological attributes for orchid survival; pollinator and mycorrhizal presence? Here, we conducted a literature review identifying the known threats to orchid survival and their necessary mitigation strategies. Next, we evaluated the success of 74 published international orchid translocations on 66 species against a consideration of orchid ecological attributes. Lastly, we empirically tested an additional 22 previously unpublished re-introductions on 12 species undertaken since 2007 against a re-introduction process that accounts for identified threats and orchid ecological attributes. We identified habitat destruction, weed invasion, herbivory, illegal collection, pollinator decline, pathogens and climate change as critical threats to orchid survival. In our global review based on published translocations, the average survival rate, 1-year post translocation was 66 % yet only 2.8 % of studies reported natural recruitment in field sites. Although survival of translocated orchids is clearly being achieved, these programmes did not relate orchid growth and development to key ecological requirements of orchid population resilience, pollinator and mycorrhizal ecology. Ensuring pollinator and mycorrhizal presence shows that these two factors alone are key factors influencing survival and persistence in an Australian review of 22 previously unpublished orchid re-introductions. In the Australian review flowering in the year following, out-planting was observed for 81 % of the re-introductions with seed set occurring in 63 % of re-introductions within the length of the study. Recruitment was observed in 18 % of the Australian re-introduced populations indicating a degree of population resilience. As orchid re-introductions will be a major strategy for wild orchid conservation in the future, we present a framework for orchid re-introductions, including criteria for success. We recommend symbiotic propagation and, for specialised pollination syndromes, the study of pollinator interactions prior to site selection and re-introduction of plants.",2016
Disaggregating the evidence linking biodiversity and ecosystem services,,FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; DECISION-MAKING; CARBON STOCKS; LAND-USE; CONSERVATION; POLLINATION; ECOLOGY; FOREST; SUSTAINABILITY,"Ecosystem services (ES) are an increasingly popular policy framework for connecting biodiversity with human well-being. These efforts typically assume that biodiversity and ES covary, but the relationship between them remains remarkably unclear. Here we analyse >500 recent papers and show that reported relationships differ among ES, methods of measuring biodiversity and ES, and three different approaches to linking them (spatial correlations, management comparisons and functional experiments). For spatial correlations, biodiversity relates more strongly to measures of ES supply than to resulting human benefits. For management comparisons, biodiversity of 'service providers' predicts ES more often than biodiversity of functionally unrelated taxa, but the opposite is true for spatial correlations. Functional experiments occur at smaller spatial scales than management and spatial studies, which show contrasting responses to scale. Our results illuminate the varying dynamics relating biodiversity to ES, and show the importance of matching management efforts to the most relevant scientific evidence.",2016

Accordingly, fig wasps, fungus gnats and moths of all sizes show remarkable electrophysiological, neural and behavioral sensitivity to different enantiomers and quantitative ratios of linalool in floral bouquets.

Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species' contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.",2016
Direct vs. indirect effects of whole-genome duplication on prezygotic isolation in Chamerion angustifolium: Implications for rapid speciation,ecogeographic; fireweed; gamete selection; Onagraceae; pollination; polyploidy; postzygotic isolation,RESYNTHESIZED BRASSICA-NAPUS; MINORITY CYTOTYPE EXCLUSION; MIXED-PLOIDY POPULATIONS; TETRAPLOID CONTACT ZONE; FLOWERING PLANTS; GENE-EXPRESSION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POLYPLOID EVOLUTION; ARABIDOPSIS POLYPLOIDS; ONAGRACEAE,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The depiction of polyploid speciation as instantaneous implies that strong prezygotic and postzygotic isolation form as a direct result of whole-genome duplication. However, the direct vs. indirect contributions of genome duplication to phenotypic divergence and prezygotic isolation are rarely quantified across multiple reproductive barriers. METHODS: We compared the phenotypic differences between diploid and both naturally occurring and synthesized tetraploids (neotetraploids) of the plant Chamerion angustifolium. Using this information and additional published values for this species, we compared the magnitude of isolation (ecological, flowering, pollinator, and gametic) between diploids and natural-occurring tetraploids to that between diploids and neotetraploids. KEY RESULTS: Diff erences among ploidy cytotypes were observed for eight of 12 vegetative and reproductive traits measured. Neotetraploids resembled diploids but differed from natural tetraploids with respect to four traits, including flowering time and plant height. Diploid-neotetraploid (2 x -4 x (neo)) experimental arrays exhibited lower pollinator fidelity to cytotype and seed set compared with 2 x -4 x (nat) arrays. Based on these results and published evidence, reproductive isolation between diploids and neotetraploids across all four life stages averaged 0.48 and deviated significantly from that between diploids and natural tetraploids (RI = 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Genome duplication causes phenotypic shifts and contributes directly to prezygotic isolation for some barriers (gametic isolation) but cannot account for the cumulative isolation from diploids observed in natural tetraploids. Therefore, conditions for species formation through genome duplication are not necessarily instantaneous and selection to strengthen prezygotic barriers in young polyploids is critical for the establishment of polyploid species in sympatry.",2016

Since robbers may modify plant fitness, they play an important role by driving evolution on floral traits, shaping population structure and influencing community dynamics. Although nectar robbing is widespread in angiosperms, the causes and ecological implications of this behaviour on large ecological scales are still unexplored. Our aim is to study the frequency of nectar robbing in plants of temperate and tropical regions and examine its association with plant traits. We characterised the levels of nectar robbing in 88 species of Mediterranean, Alpine, Antillean and Andean plant communities and identified the most important nectar robbers. We analysed associations between the levels of robbing and floral morphology, production and density of energy rewards, mechanisms of protection against nectar robbers, plant life form and geographic origin. Nectar robbing was present at all sampling sites. Within communities two patterns of robbing levels related to the diversity and specialization of robbers were detected. In most communities one plant species presented very high levels of robbing while other species had intermediate to low robbing levels. There, nectar robbers are opportunists, robbing highly rewarding plants. In the Andean community the high specialization of several co-existing flowerpiercers produced an even pattern of robbing levels in the plant community. Plants with long flowers, abundant nectar and a high energy density are more likely to be robbed by both insects and birds. A high aggregation of the flowers within the plants and the presence of long calyxes and bracts are associated to low robbing rates by insects and to a lesser extent by birds. Besides the morphological constraints that operate on a single flower basis, nectar robbing is a phenomenon dependent upon the density of energy rewards reflecting the presence of mechanisms on higher ecological scales.",2016

Because polyploidy can induce an array of phenotypic changes, there can be cascading effects on interactions with other species. These interactions, in turn, can have reciprocal effects on polyploid plants, potentially impacting their establishment and persistence. Although there is a wealth of information on the genetic and phenotypic effects of polyploidy, the study of species interactions in polyploid plants remains a comparatively young field. Here we reviewed the available evidence for how polyploidy may impact many types of species interactions that range from mutualism to antagonism. Specifically, we focused on three main questions: (1) Does polyploidy directly cause the formation of novel interactions not experienced by diploids, or does it create an opportunity for natural selection to then form novel interactions? (2) Does polyploidy cause consistent, predictable changes in species interactions vs. the evolution of idiosyncratic differences? (3) Does polyploidy lead to greater evolvability in species interactions? From the scarce evidence available, we found that novel interactions are rare but that polyploidy can induce changes in pollinator, herbivore, and pathogen interactions. Although further tests are needed, it is likely that selection following whole-genome duplication is important in all types of species interaction and that there are circumstances in which polyploidy can enhance the evolvability of interactions with other species.",2016
Individual resource limitation combined with population-wide pollen availability drives masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata),mast fruiting; masting; pollen limitation; Quercus lobata; reproductive ecology; resource limitation,CENTRAL COASTAL CALIFORNIA; ACORN PRODUCTION; SEED PRODUCTION; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; FOREST TREES; REPRODUCTION; SYNCHRONY; PLANTS; WIND; DEPLETION,"1. Masting, the synchronized production of variable seed crops, is widespread among woody plants, but there is no consensus about the underlying proximate mechanisms. To understand this population-level behaviour, it is necessary to dissect the behaviour of individual trees as well as the interactions that synchronize them. 2. Here, we test a model of masting in which variability in seed set is driven by resource limitation within trees and synchrony is driven by pollen limitation due to phenological asynchrony in some years. 3. We used a 35-year seed set data set and a 12-year phenological data set to analyse seed production of 84 valley oaks (Quercus lobata) in central coastal California. Individual trees varied tremendously in their seed production patterns; trees with high levels of seed production were less variable over time, but showed stronger negative autocorrelation between years, suggesting that they are more resource-limited than unproductive trees. In years of more asynchronous flowering, Q. lobata produced fewer seeds, consistent with the importance of phenological synchrony. 4. We parametrized a model with these results to investigate how individual resource limitation and population-wide pollen limitation - a consequence of asynchronous flowering during cold spring temperatures-interact to shape annual variation in seed production. The model illustrates that this proximate abiotic driver can synchronize the behaviour of individuals, resulting in population-wide seed production patterns that closely resemble the field data. 5. Synthesis. Our findings support the hypothesis that an interaction between two proximate mechanisms, individual resource limitation and environmental variation affecting population-wide pollen availability, drives masting in this population of Quercus lobata. This combination of internal and external proximate drivers may underlie masting behaviour in many wind-pollinated plants.",2016
How plants connect pollination and herbivory networks and their contribution to community stability,antagonism; community stability; herbivory network; multiple interaction types; mutualism; network structure; pollination network,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION; APPARENT COMPETITION; TROPHIC NETWORKS; FLOWERING PLANTS; LEAF HERBIVORY; ARCHITECTURE; DIVERSITY,"Pollination and herbivory networks have mainly been studied separately, highlighting their distinct structural characteristics and the related processes and dynamics. However, most plants interact with both pollinators and herbivores, and there is evidence that both types of interaction affect each other. Here we investigated the way plants connect these mutualistic and antagonistic networks together, and the consequences for community stability. Using an empirical data set, we show that the way plants connect pollination and herbivory networks is not random and promotes community stability. Analyses of the structure of binary and quantitative networks show different results: the plants' generalism with regard to pollinators is positively correlated to their generalism with regard to herbivores when considering binary interactions, but not when considering quantitative interactions. We also show that plants that share the same pollinators do not share the same herbivores. However, the way plants connect pollination and herbivory networks promotes stability for both binary and quantitative networks. Our results highlight the relevance of considering the diversity of interaction types in ecological communities, and stress the need to better quantify the costs and benefits of interactions, as well as to develop new metrics characterizing the way different interaction types are combined within ecological networks.",2016
The Allometry of Bee Proboscis Length and Its Uses in Ecology,,BUMBLE BEES; BODY-SIZE; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; PHYLOGENY; FLOWERS; BOMBUS; APIDAE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; POLLINATORS,"Allometric relationships among morphological traits underlie important patterns in ecology. These relationships are often phylogenetically shared; thus quantifying allometric relationships may allow for estimating difficult-to-measure traits across species. One such trait, proboscis length in bees, is assumed to be important in structuring bee communities and plant-pollinator networks. However, it is difficult to measure and thus rarely included in ecological analyses. We measured intertegular distance (as a measure of body size) and proboscis length (glossa and prementum, both individually and combined) of 786 individual bees of 100 species across 5 of the 7 extant bee families (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila). Using linear models and model selection, we determined which parameters provided the best estimate of proboscis length. We then used coefficients to estimate the relationship between intertegular distance and proboscis length, while also considering family. Using allometric equations with an estimation for a scaling coefficient between intertegular distance and proboscis length and coefficients for each family, we explain 91% of the variance in species-level means for bee proboscis length among bee species. However, within species, individual-level intertegular distance was a poor predictor of individual proboscis length. To make our findings easy to use, we created an R package that allows estimation of proboscis length for individual bee species by inputting only family and intertegular distance. The R package also calculates foraging distance and body mass based on previously published equations. Thus by considering both taxonomy and intertegular distance we enable accurate estimation of an ecologically and evolutionarily important trait.",2016

Here, using an eco-evolutionary model for bipartite mutualistic networks with trait-mediated interactions, we explore how particular levels of connectance, nestedness and modularity are affected by three network assembly forces: resource accessibility, tolerance to trait difference between mutualistic pairs and competition intensity. We found that a moderate accessibility to intra-trophic resources and cross-trophic mutualistic support can result in a highly nested web, while low tolerance to trait difference between interacting pairs leads to a high level of modularity. Network-level trait complementarity leads to low connectance and high modularity, while network-level specialization can result in nested structures. Consequently, we argue that the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes through trait-mediated interactions can explain these widely observed architectures in mutualistic networks.",2016
Nested species interactions promote feasibility over stability during the assembly of a pollinator community,Coexistence; feasibility; global stability; mutualistic networks; mutualistic strength; nestedness,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY; CONNECTANCE; COEXISTENCE; COMPETITION; ECOSYSTEMS; MODELS,"The foundational concepts behind the persistence of ecological communities have been based on two ecological properties: dynamical stability and feasibility. The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to return to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species abundances and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific interactions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all its constituent species and is linked to both interspecific interactions and species demographic characteristics. Over the last 40years, theoretical research in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the dynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to feasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of whether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be stable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use empirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the dynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we demonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are, the lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without losing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a community can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly nested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of a seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (northeastern Greenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species interactions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings imply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability, which may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.",2016
Bacterioplankton community resilience to ocean acidification: evidence from microbial network analysis,Arctic Ocean; community structure; mesocosm experiment; molecular ecological network ocean acidification,DIFFERENT PCO(2) LEVELS; CARBON-DIOXIDE LEVELS; MARINE BACTERIAL; CO2 ENRICHMENT; ARCTIC FJORD; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; ELEVATED CO2; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS,"Ocean acidification (OA), caused by seawater CO2 uptake, has significant impacts on marine calcifying organisms and phototrophs. However, the response of bacterial communities, who play a crucial role in marine biogeochemical cycling, to OA is still not well understood. Previous studies have shown that the diversity and structure of microbial communities change undeterminably with elevated pCO(2). Here, novel phylogenetic molecular ecological networks (pMENs) were employed to investigate the interactions of native bacterial communities in response to OA in the Arctic Ocean through a mesocosm experiment. The pMENs results were in line with the null hypothesis that elevated pCO(2)/pH does not affect biogeochemistry processes. The number of nodes within the pMENs and the connectivity of the bacterial communities were similar, despite increased pCO(2) concentrations. Our results indicate that elevated pCO(2) did not significantly affect microbial community structure and succession in the Arctic Ocean, suggesting bacterioplankton community resilience to elevated pCO(2). The competitive interactions among the native bacterioplankton, as well as the modular community structure, may contribute to this resilience. This pMENs-based investigation of the interactions among microbial community members at different pCO(2) concentrations provides a new insight into our understanding of how OA affects the microbial community.",2016

As such, selfing taxa are predicted to co-occur more often with their closest relatives than are outcrossing taxa. Despite suggestions that this pattern may be general, the extent to which mating system influences range overlap in close relatives has not been tested formally across a diverse group of plant species pairs. METHODS: We tested for a difference in range overlap between species pairs for which zero, one, or both species are selfers, using data from 98 sister species pairs in 20 genera across 15 flowering plant families. We also used divergence time estimates from time-calibrated phylogenies to ask how range overlap changes with divergence time and whether this effect depends on mating system. KEY RESULTS: We found no evidence that automatic self-fertilization influenced range overlap of closely related plant species. Sister pairs with more recent divergence times had modestly greater range overlap, but this effect did not depend on mating system. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a strong influence of mating system on range overlap suggests that mating system plays a minor or inconsistent role compared with many other mechanisms potentially influencing the co-occurrence of close relatives.",2016

Essential to understanding these mechanisms is an accurate reconstruction of dispersal mode over the entire history of an angiosperm lineage. A total-evidence phylogeny is presented for most fossil fruit and all extant genera in Fagales over its c. 95 million yr history. This phylogeny - the largest of its kind to include plant fossils was used to reconstruct an evolutionary history directly informed by fossil morphologies and to assess relationships among dispersal mode, biogeographic range size, and diversification rate. Reconstructions indicate four transitions to wind dispersal and seven to biotic dispersal, with the phylogenetic integration of fossils crucial to understanding these patterns. Complexity further increased when more specialized behaviors were considered, with fluttering, gliding, autorotating, and scatter-hoarding evolving multiple times across the order. Preliminary biogeographic analyses suggest larger range sizes in biotically dispersed lineages, especially when pollination mode was held constant. Biotically dispersed lineages had significantly higher diversification rates than abiotically dispersed lineages, although transitions in dispersal mode alone cannot explain all detected diversification rate shifts across Fagales.",2016
Ecological risk assessment for DvSnf7 RNA: A plant-incorporated protectant with targeted activity against western corn rootworm,Non-target organism; RNAi; GE crop; Ecological risk assessment; DvSnf7; MON 87411,DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA; GENE; INTERFERENCE; CROPS; QUANTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; TOLERANCE; SALIVA; VIRUS; GRAIN,"MON 87411 maize, which expresses DvSnf7 RNA, was developed to provide an additional mode of action to confer protection against corn rootworm (Diabrotica spp.). A critical step in the registration of a genetically engineered crop with an insecticidal trait is performing an ecological risk assessment to evaluate the potential for adverse ecological effects. For MON 87411, an assessment plan was developed that met specific protection goals by characterizing the routes and levels of exposure, and testing representative functional taxa that would be directly or indirectly exposed in the environment. The potential for toxicity of DvSnf7 RNA was evaluated with a harmonized battery of non-target organisms (NTOs) that included invertebrate predators, parasitoids, pollinators, soil biota as well as aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate species. Laboratory tests evaluated ecologically relevant endpoints such as survival, growth, development, and reproduction and were of sufficient duration to assess the potential for adverse effects. No adverse effects were observed with any species tested at, or above, the maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC). All margins of exposure for NTOs were >10-fold the MEEC. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that exposure to DvSnf7 RNA, both directly and indirectly, is safe for NTOs at the expected field exposure levels.",2016
Pollination and seed dispersal are the most threatened processes of plant regeneration,,TROPICAL FOREST BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; TREE RECRUITMENT; METAANALYSIS; CONSEQUENCES; DEFAUNATION; DISRUPTION; DECLINES; TRAITS; ESTABLISHMENT,"Plant regeneration is essential for maintaining forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which are globally threatened by human disturbance. Here we present the first integrative meta-analysis on how forest disturbance affects multiple ecological processes of plant regeneration including pollination, seed dispersal, seed predation, recruitment and herbivory. We analysed 408 pairwise comparisons of these processes between near-natural and disturbed forests. Human impacts overall reduced plant regeneration. Importantly, only processes early in the regeneration cycle that often depend on plant-animal interactions, i.e. pollination and seed dispersal, were negatively affected. Later processes, i.e. seed predation, recruitment and herbivory, showed overall no significant response to human disturbance. Conserving pollination and seed dispersal, including the animals that provide these services to plants, should become a priority in forest conservation efforts globally.",2016
RAD-seq phylogenomics recovers a well-resolved phylogeny of a rapid radiation of mutualistic and antagonistic yucca moths,,TEGETICULA-YUCCASELLA; COALESCENT MODEL; MISSING DATA; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; MOLECULAR ECOLOGY; SPECIES TREES; DIVERGENCE; LIKELIHOOD; DIVERSIFICATION; EVOLUTION,"The interaction between yucca plants and yucca moths has been one of the focal model systems investigated in the study of pollination mutualism and coevolution, especially in terms of understanding the prevention of overexploitation by mutualist partners. Yuccas have the ability to assess the number of eggs placed by pollinators into their ovaries, and can preferentially abort those flowers that would have many moth larvae consuming yucca seeds. Previous phylogenetic research identified a rapid radiation of moth species that corresponded with shifts in the interaction with their host plants. These shifts led to the evolution of moth species that circumvent the egg detection method used by yuccas to limit seed damage. In particular, some pollinator species deposit their eggs so that they are undetectable by the plants, whereas other species are cheaters' that have lost the ability to pollinate, yet deposit eggs into developing fruit rather than flowers. The evolution of these new species happened so quickly that the phylogeny of the moths has remained unresolved despite repeated attempts with standard Sanger sequencing of mtDNA loci and AFLP marker generation. Here, we use extensive analyses of RAD-seq data to determine the phylogenetic relationships among yucca moth species. The results provide a robust phylogenetic framework that identifies the evolutionary relationships among shifts in egg-laying strategies, as well as determining the closest pollinating relatives to the cheater species. Based on the obtained phylogeny, a shift in egg-laying strategy that avoided the overexploitation regulatory mechanism used by yucca plants was a precursor for the evolution of two species with cheating behaviour.",2016
Hawkmoths evaluate scenting flowers with the tip of their proboscis,,NICOTIANA-ATTENUATA PLANTS; MANDUCA-SEXTA; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; FLORAL SCENTS; CHEMISTRY; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; PREFERENCES; SELECTION; VISITORS,"Pollination by insects is essential to many ecosystems. Previously, we have shown that floral scent is important to mediate pollen transfer between plants (Kessler et at, 2015). Yet, the mechanisms by which pollinators evaluate volatiles of single flowers remained unclear. Here, Nicotiana attenuata plants, in which floral volatiles have been genetically silenced and its hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta, were used in semi-natural tent and wind-tunnel assays to explore the function of floral scent. We found that floral scent functions to increase the fitness of individual flowers not only by increasing detectability but also by enhancing the pollinator's foraging efforts. Combining proboscis choice tests with neurophysiological, anatomical and molecular analyses we show that this effect is governed by newly discovered olfactory neurons on the tip of the moth's proboscis. With the tip of their tongue, pollinators assess the advertisement of individual flowers, an ability essential for maintaining this important ecosystem service.",2016
"If Dung Beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) Arose in Association with Dinosaurs, Did They Also Suffer a Mass Co-Extinction at the K-Pg Boundary?",,MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; PLANT FOSSIL RECORD; COLEOPTERA SCARABAEIDAE; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DIVERGENCE TIMES; SOUTH-ATLANTIC; INNER-MONGOLIA; DIVERSIFICATION RATES; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES,"The evolutionary success of beetles and numerous other terrestrial insects is generally attributed to co-radiation with flowering plants but most studies have focused on herbivorous or pollinating insects. Non-herbivores represent a significant proportion of beetle diversity yet potential factors that influence their diversification have been largely unexamined. In the present study, we examine the factors driving diversification within the Scarabaeidae, a speciose beetle family with a range of both herbivorous and non-herbivorous ecologies. In particular, it has been long debated whether the key event in the evolution of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) was an adaptation to feeding on dinosaur or mammalian dung. Here we present molecular evidence to show that the origin of dung beetles occurred in the middle of the Cretaceous, likely in association with dinosaur dung, but more surprisingly the timing is consistent with the rise of the angiosperms. We hypothesize that the switch in dinosaur diet to incorporate more nutritious and less fibrous angiosperm foliage provided a palatable dung source that ultimately created a new niche for diversification. Given the well-accepted mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, we examine a potential coextinction of dung beetles due to the loss of an important evolutionary resource, i.e., dinosaur dung. The biogeography of dung beetles is also examined to explore the previously proposed ""out of Africa"" hypothesis. Given the inferred age of Scarabaeinae as originating in the Lower Cretaceous, the major radiation of dung feeders prior to the Cenomanian, and the early divergence of both African and Gondwanan lineages, we hypothesise that that faunal exchange between Africa and Gondwanaland occurred during the earliest evolution of the Scarabaeinae. Therefore we propose that both Gondwanan vicariance and dispersal of African lineages is responsible for present day distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles and provide examples.",2016

Plants use light as a source of both energy and information. Plant physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length. 2. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation. 3. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants, affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems. 4. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community and ecosystem.",2016
Generalist Species Have a Central Role In a Highly Diverse Plant-Frugivore Network,Andean forests; community ecology; seed dispersal,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; FOREST FRAGMENTATION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SEED DISPERSAL; NESTEDNESS; MODULARITY; EXTINCTIONS; ROBUSTNESS,"Analysis of plant-frugivore interactions provides a quantitative framework for integrating community structure and ecosystem function in terms of how the roles and attributes of individual species contribute to network structure and resilience. In this study, we used centrality metrics to rank and detect the most important species in a mutualistic network of fruit-eating birds and plants in a cloud forest in the Colombian Andes. We identified a central core of ten bird and seven plant species in a network of 135 species that perform dual roles as local hubs and connectors. The birds were mostly large forest frugivores, such as cracids, cotingas, and toucans, which consume fruits of all sizes. The plants were species of intermediate successional stages with small- to medium-sized seeds that persist in mature forest or forest borders (e.g., Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). We found the resilience of our network depends on super-generalist species, because their elimination makes the network more prone to disassemble than random extinctions, potentially disrupting seed-dispersal processes. At our study site, extirpation of large frugivores has already been documented, and if this continues, the network might collapse despite its high diversity. Our results suggest that generalist species play critical roles in ecosystem function and should be incorporated into conservation and monitoring programs. Resumen Las interacciones planta-frugivoro proveen un marco de referencia cuantitativo para integrar la estructura de las comunidades con las funciones ecosistemicas, al identificar los roles y atributos de especies individuales y su contribucion a la estructura y resiliencia de la red. En este estudio, clasificamos las especies usando indices de centralidad para detectar las especies mas importantes en una red de interacciones mutualista compuesta por aves frugivoras y plantas en un bosque nublado de los andes de Colombia. Identificamos un grupo central de diez aves y siete plantas en una red de 135 especies, que realizan la doble funcion de actuar como nodos locales y conectores. Las aves fueron en su mayoria frugivoras grandes como cracidos, cotingas y tucanes que consumen frutos de todos los tamanos. Las plantas fueron especies de etapas intermedias de sucesion con semillas pequenas a medianas que persisten en bosques maduros o bordes (ej. Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). Encontramos que la resiliencia de nuestra red depende de las especies super-generalistas, porque su eliminacion hace mas posible el colapso de la red que las extinciones aleatorias, irrumpiendo potencialmente los procesos de dispersion de semillas. En nuestro sitio de estudio ya se han documentado extinciones locales de grandes aves frugivoras, y si su perdida continua la red puede colapsar a pesar de ser altamente diversa. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las especies generalistas juegan roles importantes para el funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y deben ser incorporadas en programas de conservacion y monitoreo que prevengan la perdida de fauna y mantengan la conectividad del bosque a nivel del paisaje con un mosaico de estados sucesionales.",2016

The study of the Castanea flowering represents an important tool for evaluating the ecological conservation of North-Western Spain woodland and the possible changes in the chestnut distribution due to recent climatic change. The Castanea pollen production and dispersal capacity may cause hypersensitivity reactions in the sensitive human population due to the relationship between patients with chestnut pollen allergy and a potential cross reactivity risk with other pollens or plant foods. In addition to Castanea pollen's importance as a pollinosis agent, its study is also essential in North-Western Spain due to the economic impact of the industry around the chestnut tree cultivation and its beekeeping interest. The aim of this research is to develop an Artificial Neural Networks for predict the Castanea pollen concentration in the atmosphere of the North-West Spain area by means a 20 years data set. It was detected an increasing trend of the total annual Castanea pollen concentrations in the atmosphere during the study period. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implemented in this study show a great ability to predict Castanea pollen concentration one, two and three days ahead. The model to predict the Castanea pollen concentration one day ahead shows a high linear correlation coefficient of 0.784 (individual ANN) and 0.738 (multiple ANN). The results obtained improved those obtained by the classical methodology used to predict the airborne pollen concentrations such as time series analysis or other models based on the correlation of pollen levels with meteorological variables.

"Removing interactions, rather than species, casts doubt on the high robustness of pollination networks",,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; PLANT-DENSITY; BIODIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; EXTINCTIONS; SPECIALIZATION; FRAGMENTATION,"In the last 15 years, a complex networks perspective has been increasingly used in the robustness assessment of ecological systems. It is therefore crucial to assess the reliability of such tools. Based on the traditional simulation of node (species) removal, mutualistic pollination networks are considered to be relatively robust because of their 1) truncated power-law degree distribution, 2) redundancy in the number of pollinators per plant and 3) nested interaction pattern. However, species removal is only one of several possible approaches to network robustness assessment. Empirical evidence suggests a decline in abundance prior to the extinction of interacting species, arguing in favour of an interaction removal-based approach (i.e. interaction disruption), as opposed to traditional species removal. For simulated networks, these two approaches yield radically different conclusions, but no tests are currently available for empirical mutualistic networks. This study compared this new robustness evaluation approach based on interaction extinction versus the traditional species removal approach for 12 alpine and subalpine pollination networks. In comparison with species removal, interaction removal produced higher robustness in the worst-case extinction scenario but lower robustness in the best-case extinction scenario. Our results indicate that: 1) these two approaches yield very different conclusions and 2) existing assessments of ecological network robustness could be overly optimistic, at least those based on a disturbance affecting species at random or beginning with the least connected species. Therefore, further empirical study of plant-pollinator interactions in disturbed ecosystems is imperative to understand how pollination networks are disassembled.",2016

However, most described networks vary largely in sampling effort, hampering the distinction of true biological patterns from artefacts caused by poor sampling. Identifying entire seeds in the droppings of mist-netted birds is generally considered a preferred sampling method for building unbiased, quantitative seed dispersal networks. We retrieved seeds from the droppings of 936 mist-netted birds captured during five days in seven sites in Portugal and estimated sampling completeness as the diversity of seed species, disperser species, and links detected with respect to those predicted by Chao 2 estimator. In one of those sites, sampling effort was extended to 25 days to evaluate the sensitivity of ten network structure descriptors to increasing sampling effort, After five sampling days we detected 93% of the seed species, 97% of the disperser species, and 79% of the links predicted by Chao 2, however sampling for 25 days resulted in the detection of more seeds, dispersers, and links than those estimated at day 5. Most network descriptors only began to stabilize around day 8, except for Connectance and Weighted Connectance that stabilized earlier. Similarly, only after 8 days most networks descriptors significantly departed from the confidence interval estimated by null models exclusively constrained by species abundances, thus reflecting independent ecological patterns. Nestedness was the only exception, as it never departed from the null models. We suggest that Chao 2 may slightly underestimate the real diversity and that in our case at least eight sampling days were needed to build a sound seed dispersal network as 67% of the seeds, 889 of the dispersers, and 71% of the links were detected. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of seed dispersal networks because under-sampled networks may produce biased descriptors that do not suitably characterize the focal communities.",2016
Floral Sonication is an Innate Behaviour in Bumblebees that can be Fine-Tuned with Experience in Manipulating Flowers,Bombus terrestris; bumblebee; buzz pollination; learning; pollen foraging; sonication,BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; BUZZ-POLLINATION; BEES; POLLEN; VARIABILITY; ECOLOGY,"Bumblebees demonstrate an extensive capacity for learning complex motor skills to maximise exploitation of floral rewards. This ability is well studied in nectar collection but its role in pollen foraging is less well understood. Floral sonication is used by bees to extract pollen from some plant species with anthers which must be vibrated (buzzed) to release pollen. Pollen removal is determined by sonication characteristics including frequency and amplitude, and thus the ability to optimise sonication should allow bees to maximise the pollen collection. We investigated the ability of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) to modify the frequency and amplitude of their buzzes with increasing experience manipulating flowers of the buzz-pollinated plant Solanum rostratum. We analysed flight and feeding vibrations generated by na < ve workers across feeding bouts. Feeding buzzes were of a higher frequency and a lower amplitude than flight buzzes. Both flight and feeding buzzes had reduced amplitudes with increasing number of foraging trips. However, the frequency of their feeding buzzes was reduced significantly more than their flight buzzes as bumblebee workers gained experience manipulating flowers. These results suggest that bumblebees are able to modify the characteristics of their buzzes with experience manipulating buzz-pollinated flowers. We discuss our findings in the context of bumblebee learning, and the current understanding of the optimal sonication characteristics for releasing pollen in buzz-pollinated species. Our results present a tantalising insight into the potential role of learning in floral sonication, paving the way for future research in this area.",2016
Worldwide Alien Invasion: A Methodological Approach to Forecast the Potential Spread of a Highly Invasive Pollinator,,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; PSEUDO-ABSENCES; L. HYMENOPTERA; NEW-ZEALAND; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; NATIVE BUMBLEBEES; AMERICAN BULLFROG; BEE HYMENOPTERA; INTRODUCED BEES,"The ecological impacts of alien species invasion are a major threat to global biodiversity. The increasing number of invasion events by alien species and the high cost and difficulty of eradicating invasive species once established require the development of new methods and tools for predicting the most susceptible areas to invasion. Invasive pollinators pose serious threats to biodiversity and human activity due to their close relationship with many plants (including crop species) and high potential competitiveness for resources with native pollinators. Although at an early stage of expansion, the bumblebee species Bombus terrestris is becoming a representative case of pollinator invasion at a global scale, particularly given its high velocity of invasive spread and the increasing number of reports of its impacts on native bees and crops in many countries. We present here a methodological framework of habitat suitability modeling that integrates new approaches for detecting habitats that are susceptible to Bombus terrestris invasion at a global scale. Our approach did not include reported invaded locations in the modeling procedure; instead, those locations were used exclusively to evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting suitability over regions already invaded. Moreover, a new and more intuitive approach was developed to select the models and evaluate different algorithms based on their performance and predictive convergence. Finally, we present a comprehensive global map of susceptibility to Bombus terrestris invasion that highlights priority areas for monitoring.",2016

ALBA; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; OROBANCHACEAE; EVOLUTION; SCROPHULARIACEAE; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; LENGTH,"Floral nectar is thought to be one of the most important rewards that attract pollinators in Pedicularis; however, few studies have examined variation of nectary structure and/or nectar secretion in the genus, particularly among closely related species. Here we investigated nectary morphology, nectar quality, and nectar production dynamics in flowers of Pedicularis section Cyathophora. We found a conical floral nectary at the base of the ovary in species of the rex-thamnophila clade. Stomata were found on the surface of the nectary, and copious starch grains were detected in the nectary tissues. In contrast, a semi-annular nectary was found in flowers of the species of the superba clade. Only a few starch grains were observed in tissues of the semi-annular nectary, and the nectar sugar concentration in these flowers was much lower than that in the flowers of the rex-thamnophila clade. Our results indicate that the floral nectary has experienced considerable morphological, structural, and functional differentiation among closely related species of Pedicularis. This could have affected nectar production, leading to a shift of the pollination mode. Our results also imply that variation of the nectary morphology and nectar production may have played an important role in the speciation of sect. Cyathophora.",2016
No impact of DvSnf7 RNA on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) adults and larvae in dietary feeding tests,Honey bee (Apis mellifera); DvSnf7 double-stranded RNA; Ecological risk assessment,DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA; CORN-ROOTWORM; POLLEN CONSUMPTION; INTERFERENCE; ESCRT; MANAGEMENT; INSECTS; GENOME; FUTURE; PLANTS,"The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is the most important managed pollinator species worldwide and plays a critical role in the pollination of a diverse range of economically important crops. This species is important to agriculture and historically has been used as a surrogate species for pollinators to evaluate the potential adverse effects for conventional, biological, and microbial pesticides, as well as for genetically engineered plants that produce pesticidal products. As part of the ecological risk assessment of MON 87411 maize, which expresses a double-stranded RNA targeting the Snf7 ortholog (DvSnf7) in western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera), dietary feeding studies with honey bee larvae and adults were conducted. Based on the mode of action of the DvSnf7 RNA in western corn rootworm, the present studies were designed to be of sufficient duration to evaluate the potential for adverse effects on larval survival and development through emergence and adult survival to a significant portion of the adult stage. Testing was conducted at concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA that greatly exceeded environmentally relevant exposure levels based on expression levels in maize pollen. No adverse effects were observed in either larval or adult honey bees at these high exposure levels, providing a large margin of safety between environmental exposure levels and no-observed-adverse-effect levels.",2016

Despite guidelines for chlorpyrifos usage, including precautions to protect beneficial insects, such as honeybees from spray drift, this pesticide has been detected in bees in various countries, indicating that exposure still occurs. Here, we examined chlorpyrifos levels in bees collected from 17 locations in Otago, New Zealand, and compared doses of this pesticide that cause sub-lethal effects on learning performance under laboratory conditions with amounts of chlorpyrifos detected in the bees in the field. The pesticide was detected at 17 % of the sites sampled and in 12 % of the colonies examined. Amounts detected ranged from 35 to 286 pg.bee(-1), far below the LD50 of similar to 100 ng.bee(-1). We detected no adverse effect of chlorpyrifos on aversive learning, but the formation and retrieval of appetitive olfactory memories was severely affected. Chlorpyrifos fed to bees in amounts several orders of magnitude lower than the LD50, and also lower than levels detected in bees, was found to slow appetitive learning and reduce the specificity of memory recall. As learning and memory play a central role in the behavioral ecology and communication of foraging bees, chlorpyrifos, even in sublethal doses, may threaten the success and survival of this important insect pollinator.",2016

Importantly, no study to date has fully examined the role of dietary uptake of miRNA in the honey bee, a critical pollinator in both agricultural and natural ecosystems. After controlled pollen feeding experiments in adult honey bees, we observed that midguts demonstrated robust increases in plant miRNAs after pollen ingestion. However, we found no evidence of biologically relevant delivery of these molecules to proximal or distal tissues of recipient honey bees. Our results, therefore, support the premise that pollen miRNAs ingested as part of a typical diet are not robustly transferred across barrier epithelia of adult honey bees under normal conditions. Key future questions include whether other small RNA species in honey bee diets behave similarly and whether more specialized and specific delivery mechanisms exist for more efficient transport, particularly in the context of stressed barrier epithelia.",2016

Studies of how geography and climate interact to affect plant traits that influence mating system and population dynamics can lend insight to ecological and evolutionary processes shaping ranges. Here, we examined how spatiotemporal variation in climate affects reproductive output of a mixed-mating annual, Clarkia pulchella. We also tested the effects of population isolation and climate on mating-system-related floral traits across the range. METHODS: We measured reproductive output and floral traits on herbarium specimens collected across the range of C. pulchella. We extracted climate data associated with specimens and derived a population isolation metric from a species distribution model. We then examined how predictors of reproductive output and floral traits vary among populations of increasing distance from the range center. Finally, we tested whether reproductive output and floral traits vary with increasing distance from the center of the range. KEY RESULTS: Reproductive output decreased as summer precipitation decreased, and low precipitation may contribute to limiting the southern and western range edges of C. pulchella. High spring and summer temperatures are correlated with low herkogamy, but these climatic factors show contrasting spatial patterns in different quadrants of the range. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting factors differ among different parts of the range. Due to the partial decoupling of geography and environment, examining relationships between climate, reproductive output, and mating-system-related floral traits reveals spatial patterns that might be missed when focusing solely on geographic position.",2016

Ecological, molecular and geographical data suggest that the genus includes several hundred species, but the majority remains to be formally described. Here we revise the Japanese species of Epicephala Meyrick, 1880. In addition to two previously named species, seven species are newly described: E. anthophilia sp. n., E. lanceolatella sp. n., E. perplexa sp. n., E. obovatella sp. n., E. corruptrix sp. n., E. parasitica sp. n. and E. nudilingua sp. n. The first four are species involved in obligate pollination mutualism, while the fifth is a pollinating seed parasite and the last two are derived non-pollinating seed parasites of herbaceous Phyllanthus. Each of the nine Japanese Epicephela species is specialized to a single plant species in the genera Glochidion, Breynia or Phyllanthus, except for E. obovatella and E. corruptrix that each utilizes two closely related Glochidion species. Considerable variations are found in pollination and oviposition behaviors among species, which are reflected in their proboscis and ovipositor morphologies, respectively. Molecular phylogeny indicated that there have been repeated transitions in oviposition mode during the diversification of Epicephala, which were accompanied by changes in ovipositor morphology, as suggested by a correlation analysis. Keys to species are provided.",2016

Facilitation studies focus primarily on plants often neglecting the extended effects that cascade through ecological networks. Plants interact with other organisms through consumptive effects and a myriad of non-trophic effects such as habitat amelioration or pollination. 2. Shrubs are a dominant benefactor species frequent in plant-facilitation studies but can also have direct and indirect interactions with animals. Herein, we use a systematic review to address the following two objectives: (i) to propose a conceptual framework that explores these interactions including the functional roles of the interacting species, and (ii) to quantitatively summarize the current state of this field examining effects beyond plant-plant interactions. 3. To date, a relatively limited number of studies have examined the importance of coupled benefactor-subordinate plant positive interactions with animals (79 studies in total). From this set of studies, 36 studies documented positive plant interactions generating a total of 53 independent instances of either shrub-plant-animal or shrub-animal-plant interactions. 4. These interaction pathways were evenly split between direct (49%) and indirect (51%) interactions of shrubs with animals. Hypotheses frequently tested included seed trapping, herbivore protection, magnet pollination and facilitation-mediated secondary seed dispersal. The most common functional role of shrubs was protection from herbivory, and the most common animal role associated with plant-facilitation complexes was that of a consumer. 5. None of these studies explored bidirectional plant-animal interactions, used a network approach to describe the interaction sets, nor contrasted interaction strengths. Multitrophic, integrated sets of experiments incorporating plant facilitation into community dynamics are thus critical in advancing management of high-stress ecosystems wherein positive interactions are commonly reported.",2016

To counteract environmental problems due to agricultural intensification, European farmers can apply agri-environmental schemes in their fields. Flower strips are one example of these schemes, with the aim of supporting biodiversity, leading to an increase in ""useful"" species groups such as pollinators for crop pollination and natural enemies for pest control. However, to our knowledge, a complete appraisal of the pros and cons of flower strips, from a farmer's point of view, does not yet exist. It is proposed that better and more complete information could increase the adoption and implementation of such agri-environmental schemes. Objectives. This study aims 1) to assess the pros and cons of flower strips, from a farmer's point of view, and 2) to highlight the knowledge gaps that exist in the scientific literature, for the different types of pros and cons. Method. We listed the different components of the appraisal of pros and cons and conducted a systematic screening of the scientific literature on flower strips and these components. Results. The largest part of the 31 selected studies was concerning agronomical and ecological processes, such as pollination and animal pest control. Most of them indicated positive effects of flower strips. For many components of the appraisal, mostly economic and social ones, few or no studies were found. Conclusions. While a positive balance of pros and cons, from a farmer's point of view, came from our literature screening, large research gaps still remain and more research is required, especially in the economic and social components of the evaluation.",2016

However, bacteria associated with pollen are poorly investigated, despite its ecological, commercial and medical relevance. Due to structure and nutritive composition, pollen provides a unique microhabitat. Here the bacterial abundance, community structure, diversity and colonization pattern of birch, rye, rapes and autumn crocus pollens were examined, by using cultivation, high-throughput sequencing and microscopy. Cultivated bacteria belonged to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, with remarkable differences at species level between pollen species. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries showed Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum in all pollen species, followed by Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes. Both plant species and pollination type significant influenced structure and diversity of the pollen microbiota. The insect-pollinated species possessed a more similar microbiota in comparison to the wind-pollinated ones, suggesting a levelling effect by insect vectors. Scanning electron microscopy as well as fluorescent in situ hybridisation coupled with confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH-CLSM) indicated the tectum surface as the preferred niche of bacterial colonisation. This work is the most comprehensive study of pollen microbiology, and strongly increases our knowledge on one of the less investigated plant-microhabitats.",2016
An ecological function in crisis? The temporal overlap between plant flowering and pollinator function shrinks as the Arctic warms,,RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES; COMMUNITY; MISMATCH,"Environmental monitoring aims to evaluate the state of nature, and to detect emerging threats (Lindenmayer and Likens 2009, Nie and Schultz 2012). Yet, the cautionary principle of science may hamper detection at the risk of reduced ecosystem health. Of particular concern are changes in the functioning of entire communities (Walther 2010), where potential consequences of change are devastating. Clear-cut indicators at the community-scale are, however, hard to derive. Here, we define an indicator of the community-wide scope and timing of pollen carrying capacity. We apply this measure to long-term monitoring data of High Arctic plants and pollinators to reveal that with current and future arctic warming, the timing of plant flowering and pollen transfer seems to be heading towards a functional disruption. By drafting this community-wide perspective on interaction phenology, we aim to direct attention to an impending functional disruption in the Arctic - and more broadly to stimulate functionally-oriented research into how ecosystems are responding to climate change.",2016

Here, we propose a new method to explore the proximate mechanism of masting by combining spatiotemporal flowering data, biochemical analysis of resource allocation and mathematical modelling. Flowering data of 170 trees over 13 years showed the emergence of clustering with trees in a given cluster mutually synchronised in reproduction, which was successfully explained by resource budget models. Analysis of resources invested in the development of reproductive organs showed that parametric values used in the model are significantly different between nitrogen and carbon. Using a fully parameterised model, we showed that the observed flowering pattern is explained only when the interplay between nitrogen dynamics and climatic cues was considered. This result indicates that our approach successfully identified resource type-specific roles on masting and that the method is suitable for a wide range of plant species.",2016

Pollinators, which provide the agriculturally and ecologically essential service of pollination are under threat at a global scale. Habitat loss and homogenisation, pesticides, parasites and pathogens, invasive species, and climate change have been identified as past and current threats to pollinators. Actions to mitigate these threats, e.g., agri-environment schemes and pesticide-use moratoriums, exist, but have largely been applied post-hoc. However, future sustainability of pollinators and the service they provide requires anticipation of potential threats and opportunities before they occur, enabling timely implementation of policy and practice to prevent, rather than mitigate, further pollinator declines. Methods. Using a horizon scanning approach we identified issues that are likely to impact pollinators, either positively or negatively over the coming three decades. Results. Our analysis highlights six high priority, and nine secondary issues. High priorities are: (1) corporate control of global agriculture, (2) novel systemic pesticides, (3) novel RNA viruses, (4) the development of new managed pollinators, (5) more frequent heatwaves and drought under climate change, and (6) the potential positive impact of reduced chemical use on pollinators in non-agricultural settings. Discussion. While current pollinator management approaches are largely driven by mitigating past impacts, we present opportunities for pre-emptive practice, legislation, and policy to sustainably manage pollinators for future generations.",2016
Shifts from specialised to generalised pollination systems in Miconieae (Melastomataceae) and their relation with anther morphology and seed number,Ancestral state reconstruction; floral biology; generalisation; phylogenetic eigenvector regression; specialisation,HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; FLORAL SPECIALIZATION; LEANDRA MICONIEAE; VISITATION RATES; EVOLUTION; FLOWERS; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY,"Most species in Melastomataceae have poricidal anthers related to specialised bee buzz-pollination, while some have anthers with large openings associated to non-bee pollination systems. We tracked the evolution of anther morphology and seed number on the Miconieae phylogenetic tree to understand the evolutionary shifts in such pollination systems. Anther morphometric data and seed number were recorded for 54 taxa. Pollinators (bees, flies, wasps) were recorded for 20 available species. Ancestral state reconstruction was made using Maximum Likelihood from nrITS sequences. We used phylogenetic eigenvector regressions to estimate phylogenetic signal and the adaptive component for these traits. Species pollinated by bees or bees and wasps tend to have smaller pores and fruits with more seeds. Species pollinated by flies or flies and bees and/or wasps tend to have larger pores and fruits with less seeds. Independent evolution occurred three times for anthers with large pores and twice for fruits with few seeds. We detected a phylogenetic signal in both traits, and negative correlated evolution between them. In actinomorphic small-flowered Miconieae, changes in anther morphology can be related to generalisation in the pollination system incorporating flies and wasps as pollinators and lessening the importance of buzzing bees in such process. Differences in pollen removal and deposition may explain differences in anther morphology and seed number in Miconieae.",2016

This need for specialization seems to conflict with the generalized nature of most plant-pollinator interactions. Specialization and generalization are dynamic - not fixed - and exist simultaneously in multiple states at different levels of biological hierarchy. Over the short term, specialization ensures conspecific pollen transfer, whereas over the long term, generalization improves system-level robustness. The balance between specialization and generalization at different scales is critical for different kinds of ecological functioning and is an important factor in plant speciation and the evolution of plant mating systems. Community context, including diversity and interaction network structure at different levels of aggregation, is a key driver of specialization dynamics.",2016

Recently, reduced honey bee survival has attracted intensive attention. Among all other honey bee stresses, temperature is a fundamental ecological factor that has been shown to affect honey bee survival. Yet, the impact of low temperature stress during capped brood on brood mortality has not been systematically investigated. In addition, little was known about how low temperature exposure during capped brood affects subsequent adult longevity. In this study, capped worker broods at 12 different developmental stages were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 hours, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that longer durations of low temperature during capped brood led to higher mortality, higher incidences of misorientation inside cells and shorter worker longevity. Capped brood as prepupae and near emergence were more sensitive to low-temperature exposure, while capped larvae and mid-pupal stages showed the highest resistance to low-temperature stress. Our results suggest that prepupae and pupae prior to eclosion are the most sensitive stages to low temperature stress, as they are to other stresses, presumably due to many physiological changes related tometamorphosis happening during these two stages. Understanding how low-temperature stress affects honey bee physiology and longevity can improve honey bee management strategies.",2016
Community-wide changes in intertaxonomic temporal co-occurrence resulting from phenological shifts,China; climate change; community assembly; interspecific temporal overlap; phenological shift; temporal occurrence window,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,"Global climate change is known to affect the assembly of ecological communities by altering species' spatial distribution patterns, but little is known about how climate change may affect community assembly by changing species' temporal co-occurrence patterns, which is highly likely given the widely observed phenological shifts associated with climate change. Here, we analyzed a 29-year phenological data set comprising community-level information on the timing and span of temporal occurrence in 11 seasonally occurring animal taxon groups from 329 local meteorological observatories across China. We show that widespread shifts in phenology have resulted in community-wide changes in the temporal overlap between taxa that are dominated by extensions, and that these changes are largely due to taxa's altered span of temporal occurrence rather than the degree of synchrony in phenological shifts. Importantly, our findings also suggest that climate change may have led to less phenological mismatch than generally presumed, and that the context under which to discuss the ecological consequences of phenological shifts should be expanded beyond asynchronous shifts.",2016

Although the consensus among scientists is that the interaction of many factors, including habitat loss, forage scarcity, diseases, parasites, and pesticides, potentially plays a role in causing these declines, pesticides have received considerable attention and scrutiny. In response, regulatory agencies have introduced more stringent pollinator testing requirements for registration and reregistration of pesticides, to ensure that the risks to pollinators are minimized. In this context, guidelines for testing bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in regulatory studies are not yet available, and a pressing need exists to develop suitable protocols for routine higher-tier studies with these non-Apis sp., social bees. To meet this need, Bayer CropScience LP, Syngenta Crop Protection LLC US, and Valent USA. Corporation organized a workshop bringing together a group of global experts on bumble bee behavior, ecology, and ecotoxicology to discuss and develop draft protocols for both semi-field (Tier II) and field (Tier III) studies. The workshop was held May 8-9, 2014, at the Bayer Bee Care Center, North Carolina, USA. The participants represented academic, consulting, and industry scientists from Europe, Canada, the United States, and Brazil. The workshop identified a clear protection goal and generated proposals for basic experimental designs, relevant measurements, and endpoints for both semifield (tunnel) and field tests. These initial recommendations are intended to form the basis of discussions to help advance the development of appropriate protocol guidelines.",2016

Volatile emissions can influence pollinator choice, but how they act in combination with traits such as flower orientation is rarely studied. We compared flower-opening patterns, morphology, colour, orientation and volatile emissions for two closely related species of Zaluzianskya and their natural hybrids. Hawkmoth pollinators were tested for preference between flowers of the two species, and between flowers with manipulations of volatiles or orientation. Flowers of Z. natalensis and Z. microsiphon open at night and day, respectively, but they overlap during early evening, when hawkmoths showed a strong preference for Z. natalensis. The species have similar flower size and colour, but Z. natalensis emits more floral volatiles in the evening and presents flowers vertically face-up as opposed to horizontally in Z. microsiphon, whereas natural hybrids are intermediate. Adding methyl benzoate and linalool to flowers of Z. microsiphon did not increase hawkmoth attraction, but re-orientation of flowers to face vertically increased attraction when scent cues were present, whereas re-orientation of Z. natalensis flowers to face horizontally decreased attraction.

Under a fixed carbon budget, plants must allocate carbon to their mutualists at the expense of allocation to growth, reproduction, or storage. Such carbon trade-offs are indirectly expressed when a plant exhibits reduced growth or fecundity in the presence of its mutualist. Because carbon regulates the costs of all plant mutualisms, carbon dynamics are a common platform for integrating these costs in the face of ecological complexity and context dependence. The ecophysiology of whole-plant carbon allocation could thus elucidate the ecology and evolution of plant mutualisms. If mutualisms are costly to plants, then they must be important but frequently underestimated sinks in the terrestrial carbon cycle.",2016
Seasonal species interactions minimize the impact of species turnover on the likelihood of community persistence,Bialowieza Primeval Forest; coexistence; ecological networks dynamics; food webs; homeostasis; predator-prey systems; structural stability,FOOD-WEB; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORK; ECOSYSTEM; BIODIVERSITY; STABILITY,"Many of the observed species interactions embedded in ecological communities are not permanent, but are characterized by temporal changes that are observed along with abiotic and biotic variations. While work has been done describing and quantifying these changes, little is known about their consequences for species coexistence. Here, we investigate the extent to which changes of species composition impact the likelihood of persistence of the predator-prey community in the highly seasonal Bialowieza Primeval Forest (northeast Poland), and the extent to which seasonal changes of species interactions (predator diet) modulate the expected impact. This likelihood is estimated extending recent developments on the study of structural stability in ecological communities. We find that the observed species turnover strongly varies the likelihood of community persistence between summer and winter. Importantly, we demonstrate that the observed seasonal interaction changes minimize the variation in the likelihood of persistence associated with species turnover across the year. We find that these community dynamics can be explained as the coupling of individual species to their environment by minimizing both the variation in persistence conditions and the interaction changes between seasons. Our results provide a homeostatic explanation for seasonal species interactions and suggest that monitoring the association of interactions changes with the level of variation in community dynamics can provide a good indicator of the response of species to environmental pressures.",2016
The fungicide Pristine (R) inhibits mitochondrial function in vitro but not flight metabolic rates in honey bees,Mitochondria; Pristine (R); Honey bee; Flight; Fungicide,APIS-MELLIFERA; MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT; WORKER HONEYBEES; PERFORMANCE; PESTICIDES; POLLEN; AGE; L.,"Honey bees and other pollinators are exposed to fungicides that act by inhibiting fungal mitochondria. Here we test whether a common fungicide (Pristine(R)) inhibits the function of mitochondria of honeybees, and whether consumption of ecologically-realistic concentrations can cause negative effects on the mitochondria of flight muscles, or the capability for flight, as judged by CO2 emission rates and thorax temperatures during flight. Direct exposure of mitochondria to Pristine(R) levels above 5 ppm strongly inhibited mitochondrial oxidation rates in vitro. However, bees that consumed pollen containing Pristine(R) at ecologically-realistic concentrations (approximate to 1 ppm) had normal flight CO2 emission rates and thorax temperatures. Mitochondria isolated from the flight muscles of the Pristine(R)-consuming bees had higher state 3 oxygen consumption rates than control bees, suggesting that possibly Pristine(R)-consumption caused compensatory changes in mitochondria. It is likely that the lack of a strong functional effect of Pristine(R)-consumption on flight performance and the in vitro function of flight muscle mitochondria results from maintenance of Pristine(R) levels in the flight muscles at much lower levels than occur in the food, probably due to metabolism and detoxification. As Pristine(R) has been shown to negatively affect feeding rates and protein digestion of honey bees, it is plausible that Pristine(R) consumption negatively affects gut wall function (where mitochondria may be exposed to higher concentrations of Pristine(R)).

We investigated the mast patterns of the forest tree species common beech, common and sessile oak, Norway spruce and Scots pine in Central and Northern Europe over the last two to three decades. We analysed data from the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests) and additional Danish, German, Flemish and Swiss datasets. Within-plot synchrony of fructification intensity in individual trees was high in beech and spruce and lower in oak species and pine. Mast frequency increased in most regions for beech, whereas the other species showed mixed or no trends. Beech, oak species and spruce showed strong mast year (MY) synchrony, but pine did not. MY synchrony between species was only significant in Bavaria, in Switzerland and between beech, oak species and spruce in Denmark. The deciduous species showed bimodal normal masting, while the conifers had switching normal masting. Oak species and the conifers supported the large seed and the accessory costs hypotheses, and beech and spruce supported the economy of scale, predator satiation and resource allocation hypotheses.

Advantages of masting in European beech: timing of granivore satiation and benefits of seed caching support the predator dispersal hypothesis,Fagus sylvatica; Apodemus flavicollis; Granivory; Scatterhoarding; Seed dispersal,RAIN-FOREST TREE; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; DECIDUOUS FORESTS; ACORN PRODUCTION; RODENTS; REPRODUCTION; POLLINATION; PINE,"The predator satiation and predator dispersal hypotheses provide alternative explanations for masting. Both assume satiation of seed-eating vertebrates. They differ in whether satiation occurs before or after seed removal and caching by granivores (predator satiation and predator dispersal, respectively). This difference is largely unrecognized, but it is demographically important because cached seeds are dispersed and often have a microsite advantage over nondispersed seeds. We conducted rodent exclosure experiments in two mast and two nonmast years to test predictions of the predator dispersal hypothesis in our study system of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica). Specifically, we tested whether the fraction of seeds removed from the forest floor is similar during mast and nonmast years (i.e., lack of satiation before seed caching), whether masting decreases the removal of cached seeds (i.e., satiation after seed storage), and whether seed caching increases the probability of seedling emergence. We found that masting did not result in satiation at the seed removal stage. However, masting decreased the removal of cached seeds, and seed caching dramatically increased the probability of seedling emergence relative to noncached seeds. European beech thus benefits from masting through the satiation of scatterhoarders that occurs only after seeds are removed and cached. Although these findings do not exclude other evolutionary advantages of beech masting, they indicate that fitness benefits of masting extend beyond the most commonly considered advantages of predator satiation and increased pollination efficiency.",2016
High proportion of smaller ranged hummingbird species coincides with ecological specialization across the Americas,biogeography; climate gradients; macroecology; mutualistic networks; range size; specialization,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL TOLERANCE; RICHNESS; PATTERNS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ENDEMISM,"Ecological communities that experience stable climate conditions have been speculated to preserve more specialized interspecific associations and have higher proportions of smaller ranged species (SRS). Thus, areas with disproportionally large numbers of SRS are expected to coincide geographically with a high degree of community-level ecological specialization, but this suggestion remains poorly supported with empirical evidence. Here, we analysed data for hummingbird resource specialization, range size, contemporary climate, and Late Quaternary climate stability for 46 hummingbird-plant mutualistic networks distributed across the Americas, representing 130 hummingbird species (ca 40% of all hummingbird species). We demonstrate a positive relationship between the proportion of SRS of hummingbirds and community-level specialization, i.e. the division of the floral niche among coexisting hummingbird species. This relationship remained strong even when accounting for climate, furthermore, the effect of SRS on specialization was far stronger than the effect of specialization on SRS, suggesting that climate largely influences specialization through species' range-size dynamics. Irrespective of the exact mechanism involved, our results indicate that communities consisting of higher proportions of SRS may be vulnerable to disturbance not only because of their small geographical ranges, but also because of their high degree of specialization.",2016
Flower colour variation in the montane plant Gentiana lutea L.

The structure of phenotypic variation informs on the ecological processes related to this variation. Variation in floral traits is mainly attributed to variation in the pollinator fauna, while variation in vegetative traits is usually linked to abiotic factors or herbivores.Aims: We investigated the geographical variation of flower colour (and correlated traits) in Gentiana lutea and the relationship with the variation in abiotic factors.Methods: Phenotypic variation (flower colour, petal length, petal width, stalk length, leaf length, flower number, petal number and number of basal leaves) was assessed in 429 plants of 12 populations located at north-west Iberia. Additionally, we obtained data on the geographical coordinates, elevation, temperature, rainfall and radiation for each population.Results: Populations mostly differed in flower colour, from orange to yellow from west to the east. Abiotic factors were unrelated to variation in either floral or vegetative traits.Conclusions: Phenotypic variation among G. lutea populations does not result from adaptation to environmental factors. Other factors, such as historical events or selective pressure exerted by biotic interactions, might explain the flower colour variation in G. lutea along the Cantabrian Range.",2016
Improved community detection in weighted bipartite networks,modular structure; network ecology; bipartite networks; modules,POLLINATION NETWORKS; MODULARITY; ECOLOGY; SPECIALIZATION; BIOLOGY; FOREST; HERBS,"Real-world complex networks are composed of non-random quantitative interactions. Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.",2016

In this study of Shorea curtisii, a dominant tree species in hill dipterocarp forests, we collected insects from flowering branches of a S. curtisii tree sampled at 6-hour intervals during peak bloom. Of the 482 collected insects, 90.7% were thrips, which are weak fliers, and 4.2% were the predatory big-eyed bug. Only one individual of these taxa was found in a sample taken during the non-flowering season. It is possible that during mass flowering of S. curtisii, outbreaks of thrips that use scattered floral resources attract predatory big-eyed bugs, which are strong fliers, and which move among flowering S. curtisii trees providing pollination services. Since the most abundant thrips species (Haplothrips sp., 50.0%) inhabits capsule-shaped stipules of other Shorea section Mutica species throughout the year, big-eyed bugs may be able to respond to general flowering events by preying upon stipule thrips during intervening periods. Thus, pollination of S. curtisii may be achieved via the ecological food chain between several types of thrips and big-eyed bugs, and such a pollination system adapted to mass flowering could be supported by diverse tree species in hill dipterocarp forests.",2016

Assessment of genetic relationships between populations is needed for a better understanding of demographic and evolutionary processes of the species. We analyzed genetic variation and population structure of 24 native populations of Scots pine across its broad European distribution using a set of 13 polymorphic chloroplast simple-sequence repeats loci (cpSSRs). The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 11 providing a set of 458 different haplotypes (haplotype diversity, He = 0.982). Genetic differentiation in most between-population comparisons was low (F-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.08, R-ST ranged from 0.00 to 0.19) as expected for highly outcrossing and wind pollinated tree species. However, Bayesian clustering analysis revealed at least three distinct gehetic clusters corresponding to geographical origin of the analyzed populations. Ourresults indicate genetic substructuring across the distribution range of Scots pine, and also point to the existence of populations of most likely different history that maintain their genetic identity.

Bumble bees regulate their intake of essential protein and lipid pollen macronutrients,Foraging behavior; Geometric framework; Nutrient regulation; Nutritional ecology; Pollination; Pollinator health,TERRESTRIS MICRO-COLONIES; ESSENTIAL AMINO-ACIDS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; HONEY-BEES; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; FATTY-ACIDS; QUALITY; WORKERS; DECLINES,"Bee population declines are linked to the reduction of nutritional resources due to land-use intensification, yet we know little about the specific nutritional needs of many bee species. Pollen provides bees with their primary source of protein and lipids, but nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species. Therefore, bees might have adapted to assess resource quality and adjust their foraging behavior to balance nutrition from multiple food sources. We tested the ability of two bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, to regulate protein and lipid intake. We restricted B. terrestris adults to single synthetic diets varying in protein: lipid ratios (P: L). The bees over-ate protein on low-fat diets and over-ate lipid on high-fat diets to reach their targets of lipid and protein, respectively. The bees survived best on a 10: 1 P: L diet; the risk of dying increased as a function of dietary lipid when bees ate diets with lipid contents greater than 5: 1 P: L. Hypothesizing that the P: L intake target of adult worker bumble bees was between 25: 1 and 5: 1, we presented workers from both species with unbalanced but complementary paired diets to determine whether they self-select their diet to reach a specific intake target. Bees consumed similar amounts of proteins and lipids in each treatment and averaged a 14: 1 P: L for B. terrestris and 12: 1 P: L for B. impatiens. These results demonstrate that adult worker bumble bees likely select foods that provide them with a specific ratio of P: L. These P: L intake targets could affect pollen foraging in the field and help explain patterns of host-plant species choice by bumble bees.",2016
Evolutionary consequences of ecological factors: pollinator reliability predicts mating-system traits of a perennial plant,Dalechampia; ecological context; herkogamy; mixed mating systems; plant-pollinator interactions; reproductive assurance,AQUILEGIA-CANADENSIS RANUNCULACEAE; DALECHAMPIA-SCANDENS EUPHORBIACEAE; SELF-FERTILIZATION; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; POLLEN LIMITATION; OUTCROSSING RATE; FLORAL TRAITS; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; CLARKIA-XANTIANA,"The reproductive-assurance hypothesis predicts that mating-system traits will evolve towards increased autonomous self-pollination in plant populations experiencing unreliable pollinator service. We tested this long-standing hypothesis by assessing geographic covariation among pollinator reliability, outcrossing rates, heterozygosity and relevant floral traits across populations of Dalechampia scandens in Costa Rica. Mean outcrossing rates ranged from 0.16 to 0.49 across four populations, and covaried with the average rates of pollen arrival on stigmas, a measure of pollinator reliability. Across populations, genetically based differences in herkogamy (anther-stigma distance) were associated with variation in stigmatic pollen loads, outcrossing rates and heterozygosity. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that, when pollinators are unreliable, floral traits promoting autonomous selfing evolve as a mechanism of reproductive assurance. Extensive covariation between floral traits and mating system among closely related populations further suggests that floral traits influencing mating systems track variation in adaptive optima generated by variation in pollinator reliability.",2016

There has been an intense focus on the response of species to environmental changes, and more recently, the interactions of species have been examined in a similar way in order to understand the stability of entire communities and networks of interacting species. As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios. 2. Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions. 3. Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro-micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.",2016

There have been no explicit tests of their hypotheses. Indeed there were no proposed mechanisms either at the time or since by which herbivores might generate new plant species. Here we outline two main classes of mechanisms, prezygotic and postzygotic, with a number of scenarios in each by which herbivore-driven changes in host plant secondary chemistry might lead to new plant lineage production. The former apply mainly to a sympatric model of speciation while the latter apply to a parapatric or allopatric model. Our review suggests that the steps of each mechanism are known to occur individually in many different systems, but no scenario has been thoroughly investigated in any one system. Nevertheless, studies of Dalechampia and its herbivores and pollinators, and patterns of defense tradeoffs in trees on different soil types in the Peruvian Amazon provide evidence consistent with the original hypotheses of Ehrlich and Raven. For herbivores to drive sympatric speciation, our findings suggest that interactions with both their herbivores and their pollinators should be considered. In contrast, herbivores may drive speciation allopatrically without any influence by pollinators. Finally, there is evidence that these mechanisms are more likely to occur at low latitudes and thus more likely to produce new species in the tropics. The mechanisms we outline provide a predictive framework for further study of the general role that herbivores play in diversification of their host plants.",2016
Reproductive isolation of sympatric forms of the understorey palm Geonoma macrostachys in western Amazonia,AFLP; Arecaceae; floral scent; habitat partitioning; pollination; sympatric speciation,ARECACEAE VARIETIES; ORCHID BEES; DIFFERENTIATION; SPECIATION; CUNEATA; ECUADOR; FORESTS,"The evolution of a mechanism for attaining reproductive isolation between two diverging populations is a key step in the speciation process. We studied phenotypic variation, genetic differentiation, spatial distribution and reproductive ecology in two sympatric forms of the understorey palm Geonoma macrostachys in lowland tropical rainforest in Amazonian Ecuador. The two forms were morphologically and genetically distinct and differed in habitat preference, with one form being confined to moist flood plain habitats and the other occurring in terra firme and flood plain. Pollen transfer between the two forms was limited, but not totally prevented, by differences in flowering time, with flowers of the small form opening 2-3 h earlier than those of the large form. Differences in floral scent probably reduce the number of shared pollinators. A crossing experiment showed that pistillate flowers of either form produced fruit with pollen from the other form. We conclude that flowering biology may be a key factor in causing reproductive isolation between these closely related sympatric taxa.",2016

Here, we computationally assess how adaptive foraging (AF) behaviour interacts with network architecture to determine the stability of plant-pollinator networks. We find that AF reverses negative effects of nestedness and positive effects of connectance on the stability of the networks by partitioning the niches among species within guilds. This behaviour enables generalist pollinators to preferentially forage on the most specialised of their plant partners which increases the pollination services to specialist plants and cedes the resources of generalist plants to specialist pollinators. We corroborate these behavioural preferences with intensive field observations of bee foraging. Our results show that incorporating key organismal behaviours with well-known biological mechanisms such as consumer-resource interactions into the analysis of ecological networks may greatly improve our understanding of complex ecosystems.",2016

Although population genetics studies are essential to understand how diversity arises and how it can be maintained, plant populations occurring above 4100 m a.s.l. in the so-called super-paramo have rarely been studied at the molecular level. Here, we use 11 microsatellite DNA markers to examine genetic structure in populations of Lupinus alopecuroides, a long-lived semelparous giant rosette known from only 10 geographically isolated populations. Each population is located on a different mountain top, of which three are in Colombia and seven in Ecuador. We analysed 220 individuals from all the ten known populations. We find low genetic variation in all but one of the populations. Four populations are completely monomorphic, and another five show only one polymorphic locus each. On the other hand, we find extremely high genetic differentiation between populations. We discuss the mechanisms that might cause this pattern, and we suggest that it is related to founder effects, lack of gene flow, and autogamy. The genetic relationships among the populations, and the lack of correlation between the genetic and geographic distances also point to the importance of founder effects and colonization history in driving differentiation among the populations.",2016

Nonetheless, factors that prevent one partner from reaping the benefits of the interaction without paying the cost are still poorly understood. Fig trees and their unique pollinators, fig wasps, present a powerful model system for studying mutualism stability. Both partners depend completely on each other for reproduction, cooperation levels can be manipulated, and the resulting field-based fitness quantified. Previous work has shown that fig trees can impose two types of host sanctions that reduce the fitness of wasps that do not pollinate: (1) fig abortion, which kills all developing larvae, and (2) reduced number of wasp offspring in figs that are not aborted. Here we demonstrate a third component of host sanctions. Through manipulative field experiments, we show that for four of five studied species, offspring of pollen-free foundresses are only 50-90% the size of offspring of pollinating foundresses. We further show that in all four studied species, smaller wasps are less likely to reach and enter a flowering fig to become foundresses themselves. Therefore, the experimentally determined size reduction of offspring is estimated to cause an additional reduction of up to 80% in fitness for a pollen-free foundress. We determine that the size reduction of pollen-free offspring acts on the level of the entire fig fruit rather than on individual flowers. These results show that estimates of the fitness effect of host sanctions on uncooperative symbionts should consider not only offspring quantity but also offspring quality. We discuss implications beyond the fig tree-fig wasp mutualism.",2016

However, human activities are altering natural habitat structure, potentially hampering native species due to the loss of nesting cavities, shelter or movement pathways. The South American temperate rainforest is experiencing an accelerated loss and degradation, compromising the persistence of many native species, and particularly of the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides Thomas, 1894), an arboreal marsupial that plays a key role as seed disperser. Aiming to compare 2 contrasting habitats (a native forest and a transformed habitat composed of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations and native understory vegetation), we assessed D. gliroides' occurrence using camera traps and measured several structural features (e.g. shrub and bamboo cover, deadwood presence, moss abundance) at 100 camera locations. Complementarily, we used radio telemetry to assess its spatial ecology, aiming to depict a more complete scenario. Moss abundance was the only significant variable explaining D. gliroides occurrence between habitats, and no structural variable explained its occurrence at the transformed habitat. There were no differences in home range, core area or inter-individual overlapping. In the transformed habitats, tracked individuals used native and Eucalyptus-associated vegetation types according to their abundance. Diurnal locations (and, hence, nesting sites) were located exclusively in native vegetation. The landscape heterogeneity resulting from the vicinity of native and Eucalyptus-associated vegetation likely explains D. gliroides occurrence better than the habitat structure itself, as it may be use Eucalyptus-associated vegetation for feeding purposes but depend on native vegetation for nesting.",2016

It has been suggested that landscape-scale management (LSM) of habitat in a multi-farm setting results in higher provisioning of such ES compared to farm-scale management (FSM). However, to achieve the LSM solution, farmers' land-use decisions need to be coordinated. To this end, we develop rules based on novel landscape composition and configuration indices. We model farmers' interdependencies through ES in an agent-based model (ABM) and optimize land use at both the farm and landscape scales for comparison. Our analysis is based on a simple artificial landscape with homogeneous soil quality and uses crop pollination as an illustrative ecosystem service. We consider habitat configuration at the field scale. Our rules demonstrate that the coordinated solution is characterized by a higher degree of habitat availability and a configuration of habitat that is dispersed rather than agglomerated. We tested these rules over a range of assumptions about ecological parameter values and suggest that such rules could be used to improve governance of ES in agricultural landscapes.    ",2016

Consequently, the sensitivity of plants has evolved to perceive a myriad of external stimuli, which ultimately ensures their successful survival. Research over past centuries has established that plants respond to environmental factors such as light, temperature, moisture, and mechanical perturbations (e.g. wind, rain, touch, etc.) by suitably modulating their growth and development. However, sound vibrations (SVs) as a stimulus have only started receiving attention relatively recently. SVs have been shown to increase the yields of several crops and strengthen plant immunity against pathogens. These vibrations can also prime the plants so as to make them more tolerant to impending drought. Plants can recognize the chewing sounds of insect larvae and the buzz of a pollinating bee, and respond accordingly. It is thus plausible that SVs may serve as a long-range stimulus that evokes ecologically relevant signaling mechanisms in plants. Studies have suggested that SVs increase the transcription of certain genes, soluble protein content, and support enhanced growth and development in plants. At the cellular level, SVs can change the secondary structure of plasma membrane proteins, affect microfilament rearrangements, produce Ca2+ signatures, cause increases in protein kinases, protective enzymes, peroxidases, antioxidant enzymes, amylase, H+-ATPase / K+ channel activities, and enhance levels of polyamines, soluble sugars and auxin. In this paper, we propose a signaling model to account for the molecular episodes that SVs induce within the cell, and in so doing we uncover a number of interesting questions that need to be addressed by future research in plant acoustics.",2016

Despite their ecological importance, few studies have investigated patterns of spatial variation in toxic nectar compounds in plant species, and none outside their native range. Grayanotoxin I (GTX I) occurs in nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum where it is toxic to honeybees and some solitary bee species. We examined (i) geographic variation in the composition of nectar GTX I, as well as GTX III (which is not toxic to these species), in the native and introduced range of R.ponticum, (ii) how their expression is structured at patch and landscape scales within ranges, and (iii) whether climatic and environmental factors underpin spatial patterns. While both GTXs varied within ranges, variation in GTX I, but not GTX III, was detected between ranges. GTX I expression was thus markedly lower or (in 18% of cases) absent from nectar in introduced plants. Spatial autocorrelation was apparent at both patch and landscape scales and in part related to heat load interception by plants (a function of latitude, aspect and slope). As expression of nectar GTXs was generally robust to environmental variation, and aggregated in space, this trait has the potential to be spatially discriminated by consumers. Given the specificity of change to GTX I, and its differential toxicity to some bee species, we conclude that its expression was likely to have been influenced during invasion by interaction with herbivores/consumers, either via pollinator-mediated selection or enemy release from floral antagonists.Synthesis. As the first demonstration of large-scale geographic variation and spatial structure in toxic nectar compounds, this work deepens our understanding of the chemical ecology of floral interactions in native and introduced species. Spatially explicit studies of nectar secondary compounds are thus required to show how the extent and structure of spatial variation may affect floral ecology. Future development of invasion theory should incorporate a holistic view of plant defence, beyond antagonistic interactions, which integrates the consequences of chemically defended mutualist rewards.",2016
Invading a mutualistic network: to be or not to be similar,Disruptiveness; invasibility; invasiveness; mutualistic networks; resilience; robustness,PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS; FACILITATE BIODIVERSITY MAINTENANCE; MODEL FOOD WEBS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; GLOBAL CHANGE; STABILITY; SUCCESS; ARCHITECTURE; COEVOLUTION,"Biological invasion remains a major threat to biodiversity in general and a disruptor to mutualistic interactions in particular. While a number of empirical studies have directly explored the role of invasion in mutualistic pollination networks, a clear picture is yet to emerge and a theoretical model for comprehension still lacking. Here, using an eco-evolutionary model of bipartite mutualistic networks with trait-mediated interactions, we explore invader trait, propagule pressure, and network features of recipient community that contribute importantly to the success and impact of an invasion. High level of invasiveness is observed when invader trait differs from those of the community average, and level of interaction generalization equals to that of the community average. Moreover, multiple introductions of invaders with declining propagules enhance invasiveness. Surprisingly, the most successful invader is not always the one having the biggest impact on the recipient community. The network structure of recipient community, such as nestedness and modularity, is not a primary indicator of its invasibility; rather, the invasibility is best correlated with measurements of network stability such as robustness, resilience, and disruptiveness (a measure of evolutionary instability). Our model encompasses more general scenarios than previously studied in predicting invasion success and impact in mutualistic networks, and our results highlight the need for coupling eco-evolutionary processes to resolve the invasion dilemma.",2016
Variation in ecological interaction strength with island area: theory and data from the Bahamian archipelago,Ants; buttonwood; competition; interaction strength; island area; lizards; mutualism; predation; sea daisy; spiders,FOOD WEBS; TROPHIC CASCADES; DIVERSITY; POLLINATION; DYNAMICS; SPECIALIZATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; COMPLEXITY,"Aim We ask empirically how the strength of the three major interactions - predation, competition and mutualism - changes with increasing island area. We review and expand current theory concerning these relationships. Location Data for evaluating this question come from several Bahamian archipelagos and involve both experiments and observations. The latter can be especially long term; in one case data were collected over a 17-year period. Methods We analyse the effect size of the following interactions across a range of island areas: (1) predation by lizards on spiders, (2) competition between two lizard species, (3) competition between two spider species, (4) ant-plant mutualism, and (5) plant-pollinator mutualism. Results Effect sizes for predation and competition mostly show a hump-shaped relationship with island area. Effect sizes for ant-plant mutualism were reduced on large islands compared with smaller islands. Germination rate showed a steady increase with island area which we infer to be caused by an increase in pollinator limitation on smaller islands. Main conclusions We argue that the effect size-area relation has rather similar aetiologies for predation, competition and to a somewhat lesser extent ant-plant mutualism. Specifically, we suggest that high species diversity, top predators, plant defences and (for predation and competition) spatial heterogeneity with respect to refuges or resource use reduce effect size on large islands, while harsh abiotic conditions, marine subsidies and stochastic events reduce effect size on small islands. Thus, for these interaction types, the greatest effect sizes are observed on intermediate-sized islands. For plant-pollinator mutualism we suggest that the monotonic increase in effect size with increasing island area is the result of interaction strength being enhanced, rather than weakened, by diversity.",2016
Human Impacts and Climate Change Influence Nestedness and Modularity in Food-Web and Mutualistic Networks,,SEED-DISPERSAL NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; COMMUNITY STABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; ARCHITECTURE; PERSISTENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION,"Theoretical studies have indicated that nestedness and modularity-non-random structural patterns of ecological networks-influence the stability of ecosystems against perturbations; as such, climate change and human activity, as well as other sources of environmental perturbations, affect the nestedness and modularity of ecological networks. However, the effects of climate change and human activities on ecological networks are poorly understood. Here, we used a spatial analysis approach to examine the effects of climate change and human activities on the structural patterns of food webs and mutualistic networks, and found that ecological network structure is globally affected by climate change and human impacts, in addition to current climate. In pollination networks, for instance, nestedness increased and modularity decreased in response to increased human impacts. Modularity in seed-dispersal networks decreased with temperature change (i.e., warming), whereas food web nestedness increased and modularity declined in response to global warming. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they enhance our understanding of the effects of environmental change on ecological communities.",2016

They can encounter metal pollutants through various routes of exposure, including foraging on contaminated plant resources. Chronic and acute toxicity tests were conducted on larvae using artificial diets and on foragers using solutions of 50% sucrose, which contained cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb). We found that mortality increased in both larvae and foragers in a dose-dependent manner. Control larvae had higher relative growth indices (RGI) from day 6 to day 10 compared to all metal treatments, demonstrating substantial negative effects of metals on development. Copper was the least toxic to larvae with an LC50 of 6.97 mg L-1. For foragers, Pb had the highest LC50, which was 345 mg L-1. Foragers and larvae accumulated substantial quantities of all metals, and subsequent sucrose consumption decreased after dosing. Overall, honeybee larvae and foragers suffered detrimental effects when they were exposed to ecologically-relevant concentrations of Cd, Cu and Pb.  ",2016

However, species responses to climate change are predicted to be more strongly affected by extreme events than by changes in mean values. As a result, measuring species' responses to extreme events in addition to the mean changes in climate are necessary to predict species range limits under future conditions. This study examines the impacts of a cold spell in southern Florida on native and an introduced oil-collecting bees by examining the bees' interactions with two native plants species. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts from an extreme cold event on a native, subtropical bee vs. an introduced, tropical bee. Specifically, the cold spell had little impact on the abundance of the native bee, while the abundance of the introduced, tropical bee was negatively impacted. Our findings demonstrate that extreme cold spells are important climate change-related phenomena that can have strong impacts on tropical species distributions and abundances, especially at the threshold of their thermal tolerances. Our approach also provided a rare opportunity to examine these impacts on multiple interacting species, which provides a more realistic assessment of the potential impacts of climate change.",2016

Commercially produced bumblebee colonies can carry with them infectious parasites, which can both reduce the health of the colonies and spillover to wild bees, with potentially serious consequences. The presence of parasites in commercially produced bumblebee colonies is in part because colonies are reared on pollen collected from honey bees, which often contains a diversity of microbial parasites. In response to this threat, part of the industry has started to irradiate pollen used for bumblebee rearing. However, to date there is limited data published on the efficacy of this treatment. Here we examine the effect of gamma irradiation and an experimental ozone treatment on the presence and viability of parasites in honey bee pollen. While untreated pollen contained numerous viable parasites, we find that gamma irradiation reduced the viability of parasites in pollen, but did not eliminate parasites entirely. Ozone treatment appeared to be less effective than gamma irradiation, while an artificial pollen substitute was, as expected, entirely free of parasites. The results suggest that the irradiation of pollen before using it to rear bumblebee colonies is a sensible method which will help reduce the incidence of parasite infections in commercially produced bumblebee colonies, but that further optimisation, or the use of a nutritionally equivalent artificial pollen substitute, may be needed to fully eliminate this route of disease entry into factories.

However, one of the biggest criticisms of these studies is how sampling effort can affect the observed interaction patterns within these plant-animal networks. In this study we empirically evaluated how variation in sampling effort (comparing cumulative vs monthly sampled networks) influences the values of network descriptors more frequently used in the literature (i.e. number of links per species, network size, diversity of interactions, network specialization, robustness, nestedness, and modularity). For this, we studied interaction networks between ants and plants bearing extrafloral nectar sampled over 12 months in a tropical environment on the coast of Mexico. In general, all network descriptors used in this study were influenced by sampling effort via its effects on the record of new ant plant interactions throughout the year. Interestingly, network specialization and the modularity tended to decrease with the increase of sampling effort, while all the other network descriptors tended to increase along with the sampling effort. Our study highlights the importance of standardizing data sampling in comparative studies to make sure that the results found in studies dealing with ecological networks are reliable, since the intensity of the sampling effort can directly affect the structure of plant animal interaction networks.

Bi-directional consumer-resource interactions describe the cases where each species acts as both a consumer and a resource of the other, which is the basis of many mutualisms. In uni-directional consumer-resource interactions one species acts as a consumer and the other as a material and/or energy resource while neither acts as both. In this paper we consider an age-structured model for uni-directional consumer-resource mutualisms in which the consumer species has both positive and negative effects on the resource species, while the resource has only a positive effect on the consumer. Examples include a predator-prey system in which the prey is able to kill or consume predator eggs or larvae and the insect pollinator and the host plant relationship in which the plants provide food, seeds, nectar and other resources for the pollinators while the pollinators have both positive and negative effects on the plants. By carrying out local analysis and bifurcation analysis of the model, we discuss the stability of the positive equilibrium and show that under some conditions a non-trivial periodic solution through Hopf bifurcation appears when the maturation parameter passes through some critical values.",2016
Food Web Designer: a flexible tool to visualize interaction networks,Network illustration; Ecological network; Quantitative food web; Trophic chain; Pollination network; Graphical software; Connectedness web,MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; CROP,"Species are embedded in complex networks of ecological interactions and assessing these networks provides a powerful approach to understand what the consequences of these interactions are for ecosystem functioning and services. This is mandatory to develop and evaluate strategies for the management and control of pests. Graphical representations of networks can help recognize patterns that might be overlooked otherwise. However, there is a lack of software which allows visualizing these complex interaction networks. Food Web Designer is a stand-alone, highly flexible and user friendly software tool to quantitatively visualize trophic and other types of bipartite and tripartite interaction networks. It is offered free of charge for use on Microsoft Windows platforms. Food Web Designer is easy to use without the need to learn a specific syntax due to its graphical user interface. Up to three (trophic) levels can be connected using links cascading from or pointing towards the taxa within each level to illustrate top-down and bottom-up connections. Link width/strength and abundance of taxa can be quantified, allowing generating fully quantitative networks. Network datasets can be imported, saved for later adjustment and the interaction webs can be exported as pictures for graphical display in different file formats. We show how Food Web Designer can be used to draw predator-prey and host-parasitoid food webs, demonstrating that this software is a simple and straightforward tool to graphically display interaction networks for assessing pest control or any other type of interaction in both managed and natural ecosystems from an ecological network perspective.",2016

The evolutionary success of deceptive orchids is puzzling, as species employing this strategy are thought to have low reproductive success (less flowers yielding fruits) because of low pollination rates. However, direct measurements of total seed production in orchids - which is a better measure of reproductive success - are scarce due to the extremely small size of their seeds. Here, we quantified seed numbers in 1015 fruits belonging to 48 orchid species from the Pannonian ecoregion (central Europe) and obtained fruit set and thousand-seed weight data for these species from the literature. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to test the hypothesis that deceptive species should compensate for their lower fruit set by having either more flowers, larger seeds or more seeds in a fruit. Similarly to previous studies, we found that deceptive orchids have substantially lower fruits-set than nectar-rewarding ones. Also, we found that deceptive species have more seeds in a fruit but not more flowers or larger seeds compared to nectar-rewarding ones. Based on our results, deceptive species compensate for their lower fruit set by having higher seed numbers per fruit. As a consequence, their seed numbers per shoot do not differ from that of nectar-rewarding ones. Together with other benefits of deceptive pollination (e.g. lower energy expenditure due to the lack of nectar production and higher genetic variability due to decreased probability of geitonogamous pollination), our results can explain why deceptive strategies are so widespread in the orchid family.Synthesis. Our results indicate that deceptive orchids can compensate for their lower fruit set by having more (but not larger) seeds in a fruit than rewarding species. These findings highlight possible ways in which plants can increase their reproductive success in face of pollinator limitation. We emphasize that fruit set in itself is an inappropriate measure of the reproductive success of orchids - the total number of seeds per shoot is a much better approximation.",2016
Temporal Structure in Cooperative Interactions: What Does the Timing of Exploitation Tell Us about Its Cost?,,ANT-PLANT MUTUALISM; DECEPTIVE ORCHID; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; VOLUNTEERS DILEMMA; NECTAR PRODUCTION; SOCIAL EVOLUTION; SEED DISPERSAL; POLLINATION; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS,"Exploitation in cooperative interactions both within and between species is widespread. Although it is assumed to be costly to be exploited, mechanisms to control exploitation are surprisingly rare, making the persistence of cooperation a fundamental paradox in evolutionary biology and ecology. Focusing on between-species cooperation (mutualism), we hypothesize that the temporal sequence in which exploitation occurs relative to cooperation affects its net costs and argue that this can help explain when and where control mechanisms are observed in nature. Our principal prediction is that when exploitation occurs late relative to cooperation, there should be little selection to limit its effects (analogous to ""tolerated theft"" in human cooperative groups). Although we focus on cases in which mutualists and exploiters are different individuals (of the same or different species), our inferences can readily be extended to cases in which individuals exhibit mixed cooperative-exploitative strategies. We demonstrate that temporal structure should be considered alongside spatial structure as an important process affecting the evolution of cooperation. We also provide testable predictions to guide future empirical research on interspecific as well as intraspecific cooperation.",2016

These effects can have particular impact in landscapes dominated by monocultures of pollinator-dependent tree crop plantations, which create both spatial and temporal homogeneity at the landscape scale. I looked for associations between the proportion of nearby unmanaged vegetation and potential wild pollinator groups collected within flowering almond orchards in two types of landscape. In the Complex landscape, characterized by a heterogeneous mosaic of multiple crops, semi-natural grassland and natural woodland, insect pollinator groups were not associated with unmanaged vegetation. In the Simple landscape, dominated by monoculture almond plantations, most pollinator groups showed positive relationships with the two unmanaged vegetation types (grassland and woodland). In particular, all wild bee and all but one hoverfly individual were found in remnant native vegetation patches within almond plantations, rather than within rows of almond trees. More research is necessary to identify how structural differences created in monoculture landscapes, between crops and the native vegetation they encroach on, influence ecological communities and the provision of ecosystem services.",2016

To study mechanisms of community assembly, ecologists often compare spatial variation in community composition (beta-diversity) across environmental and spatial gradients. These same patterns inspired evolutionary biologists to investigate how micro-and macro-evolutionary processes create gradients in biodiversity. Central to these perspectives are species interactions, which contribute to community assembly and geographic variation in evolutionary processes. However, studies of beta-diversity have predominantly focused on single trophic levels, resulting in gaps in our understanding of variation in species-interaction networks (interaction beta-diversity), especially at scales most relevant to evolutionary studies of geographic variation. METHODS: We outline two challenges and their consequences in scaling-up studies of interaction beta-diversity from local to biogeographic scales using plant-pollinator interactions as a model system in ecology, evolution, and conservation. KEY RESULTS: First, we highlight how variation in regional species pools may contribute to variation in interaction beta-diversity among biogeographic regions with dissimilar evolutionary history. Second, we highlight how pollinator behavior (host-switching) links ecological networks to geographic patterns of plant-pollinator interactions and evolutionary processes. Third, we outline key unanswered questions regarding the role of geographic variation in plant-pollinator interactions for conservation and ecosystem services (pollination) in changing environments. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the largest advances in the burgeoning field of interaction beta-diversity will come from studies that integrate frameworks in ecology, evolution, and conservation to understand the causes and consequences of interaction beta-diversity across scales.",2016
Floral nectar production and nectary structure of a bee-pollinated shrub from Neotropical savanna,Anemopaegma album; floral nectar dynamics; nectary ultrastructure; plant-pollinator interaction,SECRETION; ULTRASTRUCTURE; BIGNONIACEAE; FLOWERS; SUGAR; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; ANATOMY; PLANTS,"Biotic pollination is critical for tropical ecosystem functioning, and nectar plays an essential role as it represents the main trophic resource for pollinators. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie its production, which is essential for understanding the basis of nectar-mediated interactions in ecological and evolutionary approaches. Therefore, this study explores the relationship between the nectar secretion pattern and nectary functional changes in Anemopaegma album, a bee-pollinated species. We analysed the pattern of nectar production under field conditions and investigated floral nectary structural changes in two different developmental stages using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We measured 30.95 +/- 23.02 mu l (mean +/- SD, n = 30) of nectar accumulated inside the nectar chamber (29.26 +/- 3.48% sucrose equivalents) at the moment of flower opening. Nectar removal did not influence the pattern of floral nectar production in terms of volume or total sugar but reduced the concentration of the nectar produced during the first 24 h of anthesis. The nectary consisted of an epidermis, a nectary parenchyma and a subnectary parenchyma supplied only by phloem. Starch grains decreased in size and abundance from the subnectary parenchyma toward the epidermis. We observed the degradation of starch grains and incorporation of amyloplasts into vacuoles at the pre-anthesis stage as well as the transformation of amyloplasts into elaioplasts during anthesis. Nectar secretion was continuous during the A. album flower life span, which was related to the functional features of its floral nectary, especially the presence of starch stored in the parenchyma.",2016

The maintenance of biodiversity and many ecosystem functions depend upon these ecological interactions. Humans, their crops and livestock can also be considered as part of these networks of interactions making network analysis valuable for considering the resilience of ecosystem services, i.e., the benefits we gain from nature. Networks are visually appealing and visualisation can attract attention and inform, both to communicate overall messages and provide comparisons between networks. There are many different approaches and layouts for visualising networks, but there is little research to help guide best practice. Ultimately though, best practice should be to ensure that messages are supported by evidence and clearly communicated with reference to the competence of the audience. Given the appeal of visualisations and the importance of networks in communicating the interdependence of species (including humans), ecological networks and their visualisation can be used to support excellent public engagement and can be used to enhance the value of citizen science, in which people actively contribute to scientific research. Network approaches could also be valuable for engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders, including their application to complex socioeconomic systems, especially where co-production of network visualisations could provide evidence-based overviews of data.

My collaborators and I have provided new tools to study these processes at a landscape scale as well as statistical tests to determine whether changes in landscape conditions or dispersal vectors affect gene movement. Second, my research on spatial patterns of genetic variation has investigated the interacting impacts of geography and climate on gene flow and selection.

Mechanisms that increase pollination efficiency between conspecific individuals are therefore highly beneficial. Many nocturnally flowering plant species in Thailand are pollinated by the nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea (Pteropodidae). This study tested the hypothesis that plant species within a community reduce interspecific pollen movement by placing pollen on different areas of the bat's body. Methods Using flight cage trials, pollen transfer by E. spelaea was compared between conspecific versus heterospecific flowers across four bat-pollinated plant genera. Pollen from four locations on the bat's body was also quantified to determine if pollen placement varies by plant species. Key Results It was found that E. spelaea transfers significantly more pollen between conspecific than pollinator heterospecific flowers, and that diverse floral designs produce significantly different patterns of pollen deposition on E. spelaea. Conclusions In the Old World tropics, differential pollen placement is a mechanism that reduces competition among bat-pollinated plant species sharing a common pollinator.",2016

Bee diet breadth has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification, but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with species persistence. We used pollen load analysis to quantify the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of species polylectic and collecting pollen from a wide range of plants. Pollen load analysis consistently identified pollens from more plant species and families from each bee species than direct observation of their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on the greatest number of farms. Increasing the diversity of plants included in agri-environment schemes may be necessary to provide a wider range of pollen resources in order to support a diverse bee community on farmland.",2016
Measuring partner choice in plant-pollinator networks: using null models to separate rewiring and fidelity from chance,bipartite network; choice experiment; diet breadth; generalization; mutualism; native bee; sampling effect; specialization,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; SPECIALIZATION; RESPONSES; WEBS,"Recent studies of mutualistic networks show that interactions between partners change across years. Both biological mechanisms and chance could drive these patterns, but the relative importance of these factors has not been separated. We established a field experiment consisting of 102 monospecific plots of 17 native plant species, from which we collected 6713 specimens of 52 bee species over four years. We used these data and a null model to determine whether bee species' foraging choices varied more or less over time beyond the variation expected by chance. Thus we provide the first quantitative definition of rewiring and fidelity as these terms are used in the literature on interaction networks. All 52 bee species varied in plant partner choice across years, but for 27 species this variation was indistinguishable from random partner choice. Another 11 species showed rewiring, varying more across years than expected by chance, while 14 species showed fidelity, indicating that they both prefer certain plant species and are consistent in those preferences across years. Our study shows that rewiring and fidelity both exist in mutualist networks, but that once sampling effects have been accounted for, they are less common than has been reported in the ecological literature.",2016

Corynura Spinola and Halictillus Moure (Halictidae: Augochlorini) contain species that are key elements in southern South American ecosystems. These bees are very difficult to identify due to close morphological similarity among species and high sexual dimorphism. We analyzed 170 barcode-compliant COI sequences from 19 species. DNA barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two new cryptic species. Interspecific distances were significantly higher than those reported for other bees. Maximum intraspecific divergence was less than 1% in 14 species. Barcode index numbers (BINs) were useful to identify putative species that need further study. More than one BIN was assigned to five species. The name Corynura patagonica (Cockerell) probably refers to two cryptic species. The results suggest that Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified using DNA barcodes. The sequences of the species included in this study can be used as a reference to assess the identification of unknown specimens. This study provides additional support for the use of DNA barcodes in bee taxonomy and the identification of specimens, which is particularly relevant in insects of ecological importance such as pollinators.",2016

This study was conducted with seven SSR markers in 12 populations representing the entire distribution area of the species. Standard parameters of genetic diversity, differentiation, structure and genetic similarity of populations were calculated and analyzed. The populations studied showed intermediate to high genetic diversity (H (e) = 0.36-0.64), compared with other Agave species so far studied. The wild category was the most diverse (H (T) = 0.87), but without significant differences with respect to populations under extraction (H (T) = 0.72), and two germplasm banks sampled (H (T) = 0.69). High structure among populations (I broken vertical bar (PR) = 0.38) and inbreeding levels (F (IS) = 0.26, F (IT) = 0.55) were identified; a 3 % of genetic diversity being distributed among management status where germplasm banks represent a genetic pool with incipient divergence from the other categories. Bayesian analysis indicated two genetic groups. Our study suggests slight effects of management on genetic diversity of A. potatorum, apparently related to alterations of reproductive biology and pollination patterns.",2016
Multiple reproductive barriers separate recently diverged sunflower ecotypes,Ecological divergence; Helianthus petiolaris; incipient speciation; pollen competition; reciprocal transplant; sand dune adaptation,ADJACENT PLANT-POPULATIONS; GENE FLOW; POLLEN COMPETITION; CHAMERION-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; INCIPIENT SPECIATION; SEED SIZE; MIMULUS; EVOLUTION; ADAPTATION,"Measuring reproductive barriers between groups of organisms is an effective way to determine the traits and mechanisms that impede gene flow. However, to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors that drive speciation, it is important to distinguish between the barriers that arise early in the speciation process and those that arise after speciation is largely complete. In this article, we comprehensively test for reproductive isolation between recently diverged (<10,000 years bp) dune and nondune ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris. We find reproductive barriers acting at multiple stages of hybridization, including premating, postmating-prezygotic, and postzygotic barriers, despite the recent divergence. Barriers include extrinsic selection against immigrants and hybrids, a shift in pollinator assemblage, and postpollination assortative mating. Together, these data suggest that multiple barriers can be important for reducing gene flow in the earliest stages of speciation.",2016
Wind alters landing dynamics in bumblebees,Insect flight; Animal flight; Pollinator; Bee; Physiological ecology; Optic flow; Collision avoidance,FLOWERS; ORIENTATION; HONEYBEES; FLIGHT,"Landing is an important but understudied behavior that flying animals must perform constantly. In still air, insects decelerate smoothly prior to landing by employing the relatively simple strategy of maintaining a constant rate of image expansion during their approach. However, it is unclear whether insects employ this strategy when faced with challenging flight environments. Here, we tested the effects of wind on bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) landing on flowers. We find that bees' approach paths to flowers shift from multidirectional in still air to unidirectional in wind, regardless of flower orientation. In addition, bees landing in a 3.5 m s(-1) headwind do not decelerate smoothly, but rather maintain a high flight speed until contact, resulting in higher peak decelerations upon impact. These findings suggest that wind has a strong influence on insect landing behavior and performance, with important implications for the design of micro aerial vehicles and the ecomechanics of insect flight.",2016
CSR ecological strategies and plant mating systems: outcrossing increases with competitiveness but stress-tolerance is related to mixed mating,,CREPIS-SANCTA ASTERACEAE; SELF-FERTILIZATION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; FLOWERING PLANTS; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; PRIMARY SUCCESSION; POLLEN LIMITATION; LIFE-HISTORY; EVOLUTION,"A number of plant traits influence the success of fertilization and reproduction in plants. Collectively these traits represent ecological syndromes that are of evolutionary significance. However, while an association between mating system and colonizing ability has been proposed, the existence of a broader relationship between mating system and a species' position in ecological succession has not been extensively investigated. Grime's CSR theory stresses that an ecological succession can involve changes from colonizing to either competitive or stress-tolerant strategies. How distinct dimensions of competitiveness and stress tolerance covary with mating systems has still not been considered. We designed a comparative approach to evaluate the link between mating system, life form and CSR strategies for 1996 herbaceous and woody species. We found that CSR strategies are significantly related to mating systems. Ruderal species - colonizers in early succession - were mostly selfers while more competitive species were more often outcrossers. On the other hand, greater physiological stress tolerance was associated with mixed mating systems. Outcrossing is classically expected to be advantageous for most life history strategies other than colonizers, but we suggest that reproductive assurance can counterbalance this effect in stressful environments where populations are sparse and pollinators are rare. Therefore, our results emphasize that competition and abiotic stresses are not equivalent selective pressures on the evolution of mating systems. Finally, we found plant life span to convey additional information on mating system variation, supporting its role for mating system evolution. These findings encourage further investigation of the evolutionary role of ecological strategies as syndromes of traits and suggest that the emergence of large databases of plant traits will help address the major evolutionary hypotheses on such syndromes.",2016
Timing the bloom season: a novel approach to evaluating reproductive phenology across distinct regional flora,Phenology; Climate; Herbarium records; Flowering; Land surface phenology,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; VEGETATION-CLIMATE FEEDBACKS; TREE SPECIES RANGE; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; SPRING PHENOLOGY; UNITED-STATES; FROST DAMAGE; GREEN WAVE; LONG-TERM; TEMPERATURE,"Context Just as the timing of the vegetative growing season affects a host of ecological processes, the seasonality of floral availability impacts ecological processes from nectar availability and allergen production to competition for pollinator attention. However, no existing methodology is capable of evaluating multi-species bloom phenology in a standardized fashion across multiple ecosystems or compositionally distinct local flora. Thus, the manner in which the onset of the bloom season (during which the majority of species flower) differs along climate gradients and among distinct local flora remains largely unknown. Objectives This study evaluates differences in the timing of the bloom season throughout the western United States, and the relationship of the bloom season to the vegetative growing season and to local climate conditions. Methods This study estimated the season during which all but the earliest and latest 5 % of local species flower (the bloom season) using digital herbarium records. Bloom season timing was compared to land surface phenology, SI-x phenoclimate metrics, and PRISM climate normals. Results Local differences in mean temperature of the coldest month explained 76 % of observed variation in bloom season onset. Variation in land surface phenology explained 50 % of observed variation, while SI-x Bloom estimates explained 64 % of observed variation in bloom season onset. Conclusions These results confirm that bloom season phenology is distinct from the vegetative growing season, and that local temperature is a good predictor of bloom season onset. This work represents a new modality for studying multi-taxa flowering phenology at landscape and regional scales.",2016
Integrative Analyses of Nontargeted Volatile Profiling and Transcriptome Data Provide Molecular Insight into VOC Diversity in Cucumber Plants (Cucumis sativus),,GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; MONOTERPENE BIOSYNTHESIS; ARABIDOPSIS FLOWERS; GLANDULAR TRICHOMES; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; TOMATO; CHAIN; REVEALS; FAMILY,"Plant volatile organic compounds, which are generated in a tissue-specific manner, play important ecological roles in the interactions between plants and their environments, including the well-known functions of attracting pollinators and protecting plants from herbivores/fungi attacks. However, to date, there have not been reports of holistic volatile profiling of the various tissues of a single plant species, even for the model plant species. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed 85 volatile chemicals, including 36 volatile terpenes, in 23 different tissues of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants using solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most volatile chemicals were found to occur in a highly tissue-specific manner. The consensus transcriptomes for each of the 23 cucumber tissues were generated with RNA sequencing data and used in volatile organic compound-gene correlation analysis to screen for candidate genes likely to be involved in cucumber volatile biosynthetic pathways. In vitro biochemical characterization of the candidate enzymes demonstrated that TERPENE SYNTHASE11 (TPS11)/TPS14, TPS01, and TPS15 were responsible for volatile terpenoid production in the roots, flowers, and fruit tissues of cucumber plants, respectively. A functional heteromeric geranyl(geranyl) pyrophosphate synthase, composed of an inactive small subunit (type I) and an active large subunit, was demonstrated to play a key role in monoterpene production in cucumber. In addition to establishing a standard workflow for the elucidation of plant volatile biosynthetic pathways, the knowledge generated from this study lays a solid foundation for future investigations of both the physiological functions of cucumber volatiles and aspects of cucumber flavor improvement.",2016

We investigate genetic structuring in an extremely wide-ranging Ficus species, Ficus racemosa, and its pollinating wasp throughout their range, which extends from India to Australia. Our samples were structured into four large, vicariant populations of figs and wasps which may correspond to distinct (sub)species, located in India, China-Thailand, Borneo, and Australia. However, the genetically most divergent group was the Indian population for the figs and the China-Thailand population for the wasps, suggesting different evolutionary histories of populations. Molecular dating for the wasps shows that diversification of the pollinator clade is surprisingly old, beginning about 13.6 Ma. Data on both the host fig species and its pollinating wasps suggest that strong genetic flow within biogeographic groups over several hundreds of kilometers has limited genetic and morphological differentiation and, potentially, local adaptation. This is probably due to long-distance dispersal of pollinating wasps. The genetic clustering into large geographic units observed in F. racemosa and its pollinators is reminiscent of what can be observed in some other high-dispersal organisms characterized by morphology that varies little over huge distances. The implications of strong gene flow for diversification processes and adaptation to different ecological conditions in Ficus and their pollinating wasps are just beginning to emerge.",2016
Species roles in plant-pollinator communities are conserved across native and alien ranges,biological invasions; centrality; conservatism; ecological networks; pollination; predicting invasion,HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN RECEIPT; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; FLOWERING PLANTS; FOOD WEBS; SPECIALIZATION; IMPACT; SIZE; INTEGRATION,"Aim Alien species alter interaction networks by disrupting existing interactions, for example between plants and pollinators, and by engaging in new interactions. Predicting the effects of an incoming invader can be difficult, although recent work suggests species roles in interaction networks may be conserved across locations. We test whether species roles in plant-pollinator networks differ between their native and alien ranges and whether the former can be used to predict the latter. Location World-wide. Methods We used 64 plant-pollinator networks to search for species occurring in at least one network in its native range and one network in its alien range. We found 17 species meeting these criteria, distributed in 48 plant-pollinator networks. We characterized each species' role by estimating species-level network indices: normalized degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and two measures of contribution to modularity (c- and z-scores). Linear mixed models and linear regression models were used to test for differences in species role between native and alien ranges and to predict those roles from the native to the alien range, respectively. Results Species roles varied considerably across species. Nevertheless, although species lost their native mutualists and gained novel interactions in the alien community, their role did not differ significantly between ranges. Consequently, closeness centrality and normalized degree in the alien range were highly predictable from the native range networks. Main conclusions Species with high degree and centrality define the core of nested networks. Our results suggest that core species are likely to establish interactions and be core species in the alien range, whilst species with few interactions in their native range will behave similarly in their alien range. Our results provide new insights into species role conservatism and could help ecologists to predict alien species impact at the community level.",2016
What if we lose a hub?

However, such predictions have a very weak empirical basis. In order to test the robustness of the pollination network to short-term disturbances, we removed inflorescences of the most connected species occurring in a lowland meadow network using the before-after approach and compared the result with that obtained by network modelling. The manipulated network showed no significant differences for the most commonly used metrics, but was more generalized than control networks, owing to a change in the preferences of pollinators. Furthermore, no secondary extinctions (emigrations) were found, owing to the considerable natural variation found among insect species assemblages. Following elimination of the most linked plant species, a new hub was detected in the experimental meadow, the hub node being a plant species with a similar inflorescence to that removed, and formerly playing the role of a peripheral node. We conclude that exclusion of the main food source forced insects to change their specialized preferences to other plant species that were available. Mostly, these had inflorescences similar to those that were removed.",2016

However, pollinator-mediated selection does not always modulate this trait and environmental conditions and/or antagonist interactions may favor smaller flowers. We evaluate the occurrence of a large-flowered family in a hot and dry Mediterranean environment, mediated by a cost-benefit balance and a male-female conflict. Large flowers have sizeable benefits in terms of pollination and reproductive success and pollinators mediate selection through male function, but female fitness is context-dependent. High floral production and maintenance costs and florivore incidence in large flowers limit female function, which counteracts pollinator-mediated selection. Large flowers are highly costly in the Mediterranean and flower size is mediated by a sexual conflict between the benefits of male function and the costs of the female one. However, a short floral longevity, occasional pollen limitation and selection through maleness keep the existence of large flowers in these environments.",2016

Tolerating shade therefore affects plants' ability to cope with other stressors, and also shape its interactions with surrounding organisms. The aim of this broad review was to map our current knowledge about how shade affects plants, plant communities and ecosystems - to gather together knowledge of what we know, but also to point out what we do not yet know. This review covers the following topics: the nature of shade, and ecological and physiological complexities related to growing under a canopy; plants' capability of tolerating other stress factors while living under a shade - resource trade-offs and polytolerance of abiotic stress; ontogenetic effects of shade tolerance; coexistence patterns under the canopy - how shade determines the forest structure and diversity; shade-induced abiotic dynamics in understorey vegetation, including changing patterns of irradiance, temperature and humidity under the canopy; shade-driven plant-plant and plant-animal interactions - how shade mediates facilitation and stress, and how it creates differentiated environment for different herbivores and pollinators, including the role of volatile organic compounds. We also discuss the ways how vegetation in understorey environments will be affected by climate change, as shade might play a significant role in mitigating negative effects of climate change. Our review shows that living under a shade affects biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of plants, it also influences the outcomes of both symbiotic and competitive plant-plant and plant-animal interactions in a complex and dynamic manner. The current knowledge of shade-related mechanisms is rather ample, however there is much room for progress in integrating different implications of the multifaceted nature of shade into consistent and integral understanding how communities and ecosystems function.",2016
"Modularity, pollination systems, and interaction turnover in plant-pollinator networks across space",Campos rupestres; community; module; pollination syndrome; QuanBiMo; rewiring; rupestrian grassland; tropics,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; SEED-DISPERSAL; SPECIALIZATION; COMPARTMENTALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; MODULES; FUTURE,"Mutualistic interaction networks have been shown to be structurally conserved over space and time while pairwise interactions show high variability. In such networks, modularity is the division of species into compartments, or modules, where species within modules share more interactions with each other than they do with species from other modules. Such a modular structure is common in mutualistic networks and several evolutionary and ecological mechanisms have been proposed as underlying drivers. One prominent explanation is the existence of pollination syndromes where flowers tend to attract certain pollinators as determined by a set of traits. We investigate the modularity of seven community level plant-pollinator networks sampled in rupestrian grasslands, or campos rupestres, in SE Brazil. Defining pollination systems as corresponding groups of flower syndromes and pollinator functional groups, we test the two hypotheses that (1) interacting species from the same pollination system are more often assigned to the same module than interacting species from different pollination systems and; that (2) interactions between species from the same pollination system are more consistent across space than interactions between species from different pollination systems. Specifically we ask (1) whether networks are consistently modular across space; (2) whether interactions among species of the same pollination system occur more often inside modules, compared to interactions among species of different pollination systems, and finally; (3) whether the spatial variation in interaction identity, i.e., spatial interaction rewiring, is affected by trait complementarity among species as indicated by pollination systems. We confirm that networks are consistently modular across space and that interactions within pollination systems principally occur inside modules. Despite a strong tendency, we did not find a significant effect of pollination systems on the spatial consistency of pairwise interactions. These results indicate that the spatial rewiring of interactions could be constrained by pollination systems, resulting in conserved network structures in spite of high variation in pairwise interactions. Our findings suggest a relevant role of pollination systems in structuring plant-pollinator networks and we argue that structural patterns at the sub-network level can help us to fully understand how and why interactions vary across space and time.",2016

Although male gametophyte performance primarily involves cellular processes, an ecological analogy may expose insights into the nature and implications of male gametophyte success. We elaborate this analogy theoretically and present empirical examples that illustrate associated insights. Specifically, we consider pollen loads on stigmas as localised populations subject to density-independent mortality and density-dependent processes as they traverse complex stylar environments. Different combinations of the timing of pollen-tube access to limiting stylar resources (simultaneous or sequential), the tube distribution among resources (repulsed or random) and the timing of density-independent mortality relative to competition (before or after) create signature relations of mean pollen-tube success and its variation among pistils to pollen receipt. Using novel nonlinear regression analyses (two-moment regression), we illustrate contrasting relations for two species, demonstrating that variety in these relations is a feature of reproductive diversity among angiosperms, rather than merely a theoretical curiosity. Thus, the details of male gametophyte ecology should shape sporophyte reproductive success and hence the dynamics and structure of angiosperm populations.",2016
Honey Bees and Colony Collapse Disorder: A Pluralistic Reframing,,APIS-MELLIFERA; NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; WILD POLLINATORS; UNITED-STATES; CROP YIELD; LOSSES; CONSERVATION; DECLINES; TRENDS; WORLD,"Scientific narratives surrounding colony collapse disorder (CCD) are often played against one another. However, oppositional knowledge politics do not neatly segregate the materiality and causal properties of the ecological phenomena they represent. Thus the challenge with CCD is not just to describe the partisan character of how knowledge about it is socially produced. It is also about how to integrate these politics through their less antagonistic material ecologies. We review three dominant discourses underlying CCD and honey bee decline and present a synthesis that conveys how their socially embedded perceptions about ecological causality are more compatible. We invoke a theoretical framework from complexity theory to demonstrate how multiple kinds of ecological causality, from the identifiable and addressable to the more emergent and unpredictable, can align under conflicting policy positions. We argue that this continuum of ecological explanations is a more conciliatory framework for responding to CCD. It provides an alternative to the antagonistic politics that tend to reify and defend either a restrictive search for a singular cause, a paralyzing documentation of all possible permutations of CCD, or a return to a utopian agrarian past. Relating how ecological knowledge is socially produced can illuminate stakeholder positions and strategies. But it is also constructive to map out how the ecological suppositions underlying them relate and inform one under.",2016

Theoretical models show that communities are relatively insensitive to species loss [5, 6]; however, they disagree with field manipulations showing a cascade of extinctions [7, 8] and have seldom been tested under field conditions (e.g., [9]). We experimentally removed the most abundant seed-dispersing ant species from seed dispersal networks in a Mediterranean landscape, replicating the experiment in three types of habitat, and then compared these communities to un-manipulated control communities. Removal did not result in large-scale changes in network structure. It revealed extensive structural plasticity of the remaining community, which rearranged itself through rewiring, while maintaining its functionality. The remaining ant species widened their diet breadth in a way that maintained seed dispersal, despite the identity of many interactions changing. The species interaction strength decreased; thus, the importance of each ant species for seed dispersal became more homogeneous, thereby reducing the dependence of seed species on one dominant ant species. Compared to the experimental results, a simulation model that included rewiring considerably overestimated the effect of species loss on network robustness. If community-level species loss models are to be of practical use in ecology or conservation, they need to include behavioral and population responses, and they need to be routinely tested under field conditions; doing this would be to the advantage of both empiricists and theoreticians.",2016
Plant-pollinator co-evolution: It's time to reconnect with Optimal Foraging Theory and Evolutionarily Stable Strategies,Plant-pollinator relationships; Pollination syndromes; Floral nectar; Energy; Fitness,SUGAR COMPOSITION; SEXUAL CONFLICT; EMPTY FLOWERS; NECTAR; HUMMINGBIRD; BUMBLEBEES; BEHAVIOR; SHIFTS; GAME; DISTRIBUTIONS,"Pollination syndromes (correlations between floral and pollinator traits), have long interested ecologists, but remain inadequately explained. For example, plant species pollinated by relatively large animals cannot have evolved correspondingly high rates of nectar-energy production simply because such animals need relatively more energy; evolution does not work that way. The inverse correlation between pollinator body-size and nectar concentration is similarly difficult to explain. To remedy this, I propose that Optimal Foraging Theory (OFT) and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy approach (ESS) be combined and applied to pollination syndromes. Both hypothesise that, through evolution, average biological fitness of individuals has been maximised. OFT predicts foraging consequences for pollinators varying in body size, and other attributes, allowing the ESS approach to be applied to co-adapted plant-pollinator traits. This should lead to predicted relationships between plants and their pollinators. The steps involved in this process are conceptually straightforward, but empirically difficult, which may explain why the approach has been very little pursued in the past. However such difficulties can be overcome, thus pointing to the future. We surely need to understand pollination systems, in order to conserve and manage them. It is therefore time to reconnect OFT and plant-pollinator co-evolution, within the general ESS approach, and hence increasing our understanding of pollination syndromes and other plant-pollinator relationships.

Morphologically, similar species are expected to be ecologically alike and exhibit little niche differentiation, which makes it difficult to explain the co-occurrence of cryptic species. Here, we investigated interspecific niche differentiation within a complex of cryptic bumblebee species that co-occur extensively in the United Kingdom. We compared the interspecific variation along different niche dimensions, to determine how they partition a niche to avoid competitive exclusion. We studied the species B. cryptarum, B. lucorum, and B. magnus at a single location in the northwest of Scotland throughout the flight season. Using mitochondrial DNA for species identification, we investigated differences in phenology, response to weather variables and forage use. We also estimated niche region and niche overlap between different castes of the three species. Our results show varying levels of niche partitioning between the bumblebee species along three niche dimensions. The species had contrasting phenologies: The phenology of B. magnus was delayed relative to the other two species, while B. cryptarum had a relatively extended phenology, with workers and males more common than B. lucorum early and late in the season. We found divergent thermal specialisation: In contrast to B. cryptarum and B. magnus, B. lucorum worker activity was skewed toward warmer, sunnier conditions, leading to interspecific temporal variation. Furthermore, the three species differentially exploited the available forage plants: In particular, unlike the other two species, B. magnus fed predominantly on species of heather. The results suggest that ecological divergence in different niche dimensions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the environment may contribute to the persistence of cryptic species in sympatry. Furthermore, our study suggests that cryptic species provide distinct and unique ecosystem services, demonstrating that morphological similarity does not necessarily equate to ecological equivalence.",2016
Nectar yeasts of the Metschnikowia clade are highly susceptible to azole antifungals widely used in medicine and agriculture,azoles; broth microdilution; EUCAST; floral nectar; insect pollinators; Metschnikowia clade,SOUTHERN SPANISH PLANTS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; WASTE-WATER; BUMBLE BEES; SP NOV.; FUNGICIDES; MECHANISMS; FUNGAL; GROWTH; COMMUNITIES,"The widespread use of azole antifungals in medicine and agriculture and the resulting long-persistent residues could potentially affect beneficial fungi. However, there is very little information on the tolerance of non-target environmental fungi to azoles. In this study, we assessed the susceptibility of diverse plant-and insect-associated yeasts from the Metschnikowia clade, including several ecologically important species, to widely used medical and agricultural azoles (epoxiconazole, imazalil, ketoconazole and voriconazole). A total of 120 strains from six species were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the EUCAST broth microdilution procedure after some necessary modifications were made. The majority of species tested were highly susceptible to epoxiconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole (>95% of strains showed MICs <= 0.125 mg l(-1)). Most strains were also very susceptible to imazalil, although MIC values were generally higher than for the other azoles. Furthermore, certain Metschnikowia reukaufii strains displayed a 'trailing' phenotype (i.e. showed reduced but persistent growth at antifungal concentrations above the MIC), but this characteristic was dependent on test conditions. It was concluded that exposure to azoles may pose a risk for ecologically relevant yeasts from the Metschnikowia clade, and thus could potentially impinge on the tripartite interaction linking these fungi with plants and their insect pollinators.",2016
Tracking the elusive history of diversification in plant-herbivorous insect-parasitoid food webs: insights from figs and fig wasps,biogeography; co-evolution; community structure; Ficus; mutualism,MUTUALISM; COMMUNITIES; SPACE,"The food webs consisting of plants, herbivorous insects and their insect parasitoids are a major component of terrestrial biodiversity. They play a central role in the functioning of all terrestrial ecosystems, and the number of species involved is mind-blowing (Nyman etal. ). Nevertheless, our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological determinants of their diversity is still in its infancy. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sutton etal. () open a window into the comparative analysis of spatial genetic structuring in a set of comparable multitrophic models, involving highly species-specific interactions: figs and fig wasps. This is the first study to compare genetic structure using population genetics tools in a fig-pollinating wasp (Pleistodontes imperialis sp1) and its main parasitoid (Sycoscapter sp.A). The fig-pollinating wasp has a discontinuous spatial distribution that correlates with genetic differentiation, while the parasitoid bridges the discontinuity by parasitizing other pollinator species on the same host fig tree and presents basically no spatial genetic structure. The full implications of these results for our general understanding of plant-herbivorous insect-insect parasitoids diversification become apparent when envisioned within the framework of recent advances in fig and fig wasp biology.",2016

Flood regulation benefits people directly by decreasing the socio-economic costs of flooding and indirectly by its positive impacts on cultural (e.g., fishing) and provisioning (e.g., water supply) ecosystem services. Like other regulating ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, water purification), flood regulation is often enhanced or replaced by technology, but the relative efficacy of natural versus technological features in controlling floods has scarcely been examined. In an effort to assess flood regulation capacity for selected urban watersheds in the southeastern United States, we: (1) used long-term flood records to assess relative influence of technological and biophysical indicators on flood magnitude and duration, (2) compared the widely used runoff curve number (RCN) approach for assessing the biophysical capacity to regulate floods to an alternative approach that acknowledges land cover and soil properties separately, and (3) mapped technological and biophysical flood regulation capacities based on indicator importance-values derived for flood magnitude and duration. We found that watersheds with high biophysical (via the alternative approach) and technological capacities lengthened the duration and lowered the peak of floods. We found the RCN approach yielded results opposite that expected, possibly because it confounds soil and land cover processes, particularly in urban landscapes, while our alternative approach coherently separates these processes. Mapping biophysical (via the alternative approach) and technological capacities revealed great differences among watersheds. Our study improves on previous mapping of flood regulation by (1) incorporating technological capacity, (2) providing high spatial resolution (i.e., 10-m pixel) maps of watershed capacities, and (3) deriving importance-values for selected landscape indicators. By accounting for technology that enhances or replaces natural flood regulation, our approach enables watershed managers to make more informed choices in their flood-control investments.     ",2016

Harsh abiotic conditions - such as low temperatures that lead to spring and summer frost events in high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems - can have strong negative consequences for plant growth, survival and reproduction. 2. Despite the predicted increase in episodic frost events under continued climate change in some ecosystems, our general understanding of the factors associated with frost sensitivity of reproductive and vegetative plant structures in natural plant communities is limited. The timing of growth and reproduction may be an important strategy by which plants can avoid frost. 3. In this study, we experimentally investigated the frost sensitivity of eight long-lived perennial herbaceous plant species from a subalpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA. The study taxa represent four congeneric pairs from four flowering plant families; within each pair, there is a species with early and late growth and reproductive phenology. Thus, we control for evolutionary history - and therefore additional traits shared through common ancestry - to some degree, while examining the influence of phenology on frost sensitivity. Specifically, we compared frost sensitivity of vegetative and reproductive structures for each species and asked whether frost sensitivity was similar between species within congeneric pairs or, instead, was related to phenology (i.e. differences in the timing of growth and reproduction). 4. For most species (6 of 8), flowers were more sensitive to frost than leaves. Within most congeneric pairs (3 of 4), the leaves of species with later phenology were significantly more sensitive to frost than the leaves of species with earlier phenology. For flowers, the later flowering species were more sensitive in two of the four congeneric pairs. 5. Synthesis. This study contributes to our general understanding of factors related to interspecific differences in plant sensitivity to episodic frost events of naturally occurring species. The increased frost sensitivity of reproductive structures compared to vegetative structures may be a widespread pattern for long-lived perennial plants. Furthermore, we find evidence for a trade-off between phenology and frost sensitivity, whereby species with later phenology exhibit higher frost sensitivity compared to species with earlier phenology. These results have implications for plant populations, species interactions and ecological communities.",2016
All in an afternoon: mixed breeding system in one-day lasting flowers of Hypericum elodes L.

Here we report a study of the floral and reproductive biology of Hypericum elodes, an Atlantic-European soft-water pools specialist which shows a floral architecture consistent with both self-and cross-pollination. Controlled pollination experiments were performed in a natural population during three consecutive years. Marked flowers were monitored until fruit production, and laboratory germination experiments were conducted with the seeds produced. Plants were self-compatible (SCI > 0.75), however, compared with selfing, cross-pollination enhanced fruit-set, seed-set and seedling growth, but not seed germination. Inbreeding depression (delta) was mild in the pre-dispersal stages (delta = 0.22 for fruit set, 0.18 for seed set and 0.13 for seed mass), low for germination percentage (delta = 0.003) and mild for seedling growth (delta = 0.23). The breeding system of H. elodes promotes outcrossing and assures reproductive success by means of competitive autogamy. Our results suggest a mixed mating strategy for the studied population, characterized by mild inbreeding depression (cumulative delta = 0.57), highlighting the benefit of this reproductive mode in unpredictable habitat, as the typical shallow-water meadows where H. elodes grows.",2016
"First record of a non-pollinating fig wasp (Hymenoptera: Sycophaginae) from Dominican amber, with estimation of the size of its host figs",Agaonidae; Chalcidoidea; Ficus; fossil insect communities; Miocene; palaeoecology,NEW-WORLD; AGAONIDAE; EVOLUTION; FICUS; COEVOLUTION; HISTORY; CHALCIDOIDEA; CONSTRAINTS; PHYLOGENY; MUTUALISM,"Fig trees and their pollinating fig wasps arose about 75 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. Several other groups of chalcid wasps also utilize figs for larval development, including sycophagines, the putative sister group to pollinating fig wasps. Whereas stone and amber fossil pollinators are known, no fossils representing non-pollinating fig wasp groups have been confirmed previously. Here, we describe the first Sycophaginae from the c. 15-20 Ma Dominican amber, Idarnes thanatos sp. nov. Farache, Rasplus, Pereira and Compton, and discuss its relationships within the Idarnes carme species group. Additionally, we use linear regression to compare body size, ovipositor sheaths length, and host fig size data from extant Idarnes species to estimate the size of its host figs. Idarnes thanatos was most likely associated with small to medium sized figs (diameter <= 1.0 cm), that were likely to have been dispersed by birds and primates. The discovery of this close relative of extant non-pollinating fig wasps suggests that early Miocene and modern fig wasp communities may share similar ecological and functional features.",2016

The calculation can furthermore be partitioned by iterating through an optional provided polygon layer. The new tool is integrated into the QGIS processing framework and can thus be used as a stand-alone tool or within bigger complex models. For illustration a potential case-study is presented, which tries to quantify pollinator responses on landscape derived metrics at various scales.    ",2016

However, less is known about the biochemical basis of red colouration in different taxa. In this study, we examine the spectral properties, anthocyanin composition and carotenoid expression of red flowers in the tomato family, Solanaceae, which have evolved independently multiple times across the group. Our study demonstrates that Solanaceae typically make red flowers either by the sole production of red anthocyanins or, more commonly, by the dual production of purple or blue anthocyanins and orange carotenoids. In using carotenoids to modify the effect of purple and/or blue anthocyanins, these Solanaceae species have converged on the same floral hue as those solely producing red anthocyanins, even when considering the visual system of pollinators. The use of blue anthocyanins in red flowers appears to differ from other groups, and suggests that the genetic changes underlying evolutionary shifts to red flowers may not be as predictable as previously suggested.",2016

Bumblebees provide a useful model system to explore how different lifestyles are reflected in learning abilities, because their (female but sterile) workers and males engage in fundamentally different behaviour routines. Bumblebee males, like workers, embark on active flower foraging but in contrast to workers they have to trade off their feeding with mate search, potentially affecting their abilities to learn and utilize floral cues efficiently during foraging. We used a serial colour-learning task with freely flying males and workers to compare their ability to flexibly learn visual floral cues with reward in a foraging scenario that changed over time. Male bumblebees did not differ from workers in both their learning speed and their ability to overcome previously acquired associations, when these ceased to predict reward. In all foraging tasks we found a significant improvement in choice accuracy in both sexes over the course of the training. In both sexes, the characteristics of the foraging performance depended largely on the colour difference of the two presented feeder types. Large colour distances entailed fast and reliable learning of the rewarding feeders whereas choice accuracy on highly similar colours improved significantly more slowly. Conversely, switching from a learned feeder type to a novel one was fastest for similar feeder colours and slow for highly different ones. Overall, we show that behavioural sex dimorphism in bumblebees did not affect their learning abilities beyond the mating context. We discuss the possible drivers and limitations shaping the foraging abilities of males and workers and implications for pollination ecology. We also suggest stingless male bumblebees as an advantageous alternative model system for the study of pollinator cognition.",2016
Ecological networks are more sensitive to plant than to animal extinction under climate change,,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; RANGE SIZE; BODY-SIZE; FOOD-WEB; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; CONSERVATION,"Impacts of climate change on individual species are increasingly well documented, but we lack understanding of how these effects propagate through ecological communities. Here we combine species distribution models with ecological network analyses to test potential impacts of climate change on >700 plant and animal species in pollination and seed-dispersal networks from central Europe. We discover that animal species that interact with a low diversity of plant species have narrow climatic niches and are most vulnerable to climate change. In contrast, biotic specialization of plants is not related to climatic niche breadth and vulnerability. A simulation model incorporating different scenarios of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches shows that projected plant extinctions under climate change are more likely to trigger animal coextinctions than vice versa. This result demonstrates that impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be amplified via extinction cascades from plants to animals in ecological networks.",2016

Identifications are best achieved through the direct inspection of reference material. Most substantial reference collections are located at research institutions in Europe or North America, which restricts access for researchers trying to advance palynology in less developed countries. Due to the development of digital imaging and fast internet access it is now possible to produce high quality images from pollen and spore reference collections and make them globally available. In this pollen and spore atlas we contribute to this growing body of work by presenting images of 240 pollen types (in 202 genera and similar to 79 families) and 30 spore types (in 25 genera and similar to 17 families) from a wide range of different vegetation types originating from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. We provide an overview on the range of pollen and spore types commonly found in Last Glacial and Holocene sedimentary archives in studies from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. Besides a pollen key, detailed information is given on pollination, habitus and habitat which all support the interpretation and environmental reconstructions from pollen records. The atlas will serve as useful guide for palynological investigations, aiming at detailed and comprehensive reconstruction of past vegetation, environmental and climate change in tropical East Africa.

Spatial targeting of habitat creation has the potential to improve agri-environment scheme outcomes for macro-moths,connectivity; cropland; generalist; Hampshire; host plant; land sharing; landscape configuration; pollinator; protected area; semi-natural habitat,FIELD MARGINS; COUNT DATA; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; FARMLAND; ECOLOGY; SCALE; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS,"Agri-environment scheme (AES) interventions are a major avenue for habitat creation and restoration across Europe. To maximize benefits for biodiversity, AES interventions are sometimes spatially targeted relative to existing semi-natural habitat (SNH). However, the evidence base for effective spatial targeting is deficient; studies until now have collated data across several taxa and regions, resulting in non-specific advice that is only useful at the regional scale. We present a field study using macro-moths (Lepidoptera) to test (i) the impact of creating grassland habitat on arable field margins, (ii) how the impact of this type of AES intervention varies according to species specialism and (iii) the potential impact of spatially targeting AES interventions for proximity to semi-natural chalk grassland (CG). We surveyed macro-moths on arable fields with and without AES interventions across a range of levels of connectivity to CG. We also surveyed macro-moths on CG habitat. Macro-moth abundance was highest on CG and lowest on arable field centres. The benefits of AES interventions were largest for grassland-associated macro-moths: abundance was approximate to 14 times higher on AES margins than on control margins for this group. Chalk grassland-associated macro-moths only benefited from AES interventions that were close (<1km) to large areas (>10ha) of CG habitat. We estimate that clustering AES interventions around CG could lead to a approximate to 17% increase in CG macro-moth abundance on arable margins across our sampled region, leading to an overall increase of 26% within the sampled region.Synthesis and applications. We provide evidence that for conservation of species associated with a specific type of semi-natural habitat (SNH), agri-environment scheme (AES) interventions are most effectively positioned close to that habitat. Our study on macro-moths in arable fields with and without AES interventions across a range of levels of connectivity to chalk grassland represents a template for the production of tailored spatial targeting advice. We show that optimal positioning of AES habitat creation depends on the extent of SNH in the surrounding landscape as well as the ecology and life history of species being conserved.

Reproductive isolation of diverging populations is a critical step at the onset of speciation. An excellent example for exploring the extent of reproductive isolation at early stages of speciation is provided by Heliosperma pusillum and H. veselskyi (Caryophyllaceae), two reciprocally non-monophyletic, ecologically differentiated species from the Alps. Interspecific gene flow-as revealed by recent genetic studies-is rare even between geographically close populations. Cross pollinations and fitness experiments revealed no evidence of intrinsic reproductive barriers, since fitness parameters measured under uniform conditions were not lower in inter- than in intraspecific crosses. Further, morphometric analyses of the offspring clearly showed that the differentiation of parental species is heritable. As parental phenotypes are likely adaptive, the intermediate morphology of hybrids may lead to reduced hybrid fitness in parental habitats. Altogether, H. pusillum and H. veselskyi provide an increasingly well characterised model system offering exciting insights into early stages of ecological speciation.",2016

Although the literature area has expanded rapidly, there remains ongoing debate about the usefulness of such exercises. Reviewing the methods and findings of the current body of literature, this review highlights three major trends: (i) estimated benefits are heterogeneous, even when using the same method, due to several often neglected factors. (ii) The current body of literature focuses heavily on the developed world, neglecting the effects on developing countries. (iii) Very few studies are suitable for informing management and policy. The review highlights the need for fully interdisciplinary work that embeds stakeholders and economic impacts into primary ecological research.",2016
Genetic structure and diversity of populations of polyploid Tibouchina pulchra Cogn.

Several factors may influence genetic variation, such as mutations, selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic structure and diversity of populations of Tibouchina pulchra Cogn. (Melastomataceae) trees in two extremes of an elevational gradient experiencing different environmental conditions. Nine polymorphic micro-satellite loci were used to measure the genetic diversity of 14 adult populations, whose structure was evaluated using frequentist and Bayesian analyses. We also carried out progeny structure and paternity analyses comparing the number of fathers of each progeny and the probability of the progeny genotypes to be the result of selfing in order to evaluate the possible current processes leading to such genetic structure. Genetic structure analyses indicated the existence of genetic differentiation between populations in adults and progenies, but with a contact interface between them. The population from the higher region showed smaller genetic diversity when compared to the population at the lower region. However, the pollen variability delivered to the stigmas at the higher region was not different from that of the lower region. These results may be explained by the dynamics of gene flow mediated by pollen, especially by the different amounts of pollination events in each region, as well as local adaptation, distribution, and reproduction characteristics of T. pulchra.",2016

At the same time, they raise new questions and challenges. Here, I highlight the most important problems and outline how network tools can be effectively used in mycorrhizal ecology. Network-based tools can be used to explore and visualize mycorrhizal interaction patterns: this can pave the way towards further empirical work and hypothesis testing. However, network-based tools cannot, by themselves alone, provide much insight about the ecological mechanisms driving the establishment of mycorrhizal interactions, because many mechanisms can yield a given network-level pattern. They also cannot help predicting the future dynamics of mycorrhizal communities, because modelling studies need to be conducted using parameters and rules that are relevant to the mycorrhizal symbiosis, which is not currently done. Also, drawing analogies between mycorrhizal networks and other types of networks must be made with caution, taking into account all the potential similarities, but also discrepancies, between these kinds of unrelated networks. I think that keeping the above issues in mind will be critical to keep the network-based approach viable and useful in mycorrhizal ecology. ",2016
"Beekeeping practices and geographic distance, not land use, drive gene flow across tropical bees",beekeeping; dispersal; land use; landscape genetics; pollination; stingless bees,ATLANTIC RAIN-FOREST; STINGLESS BEE; TETRAGONISCA-ANGUSTULA; POLLINATOR DECLINE; WILD POLLINATORS; MODEL SELECTION; APIDAE; POPULATIONS; LANDSCAPE; CONSERVATION,"Across the globe, wild bees are threatened by ongoing natural habitat loss, risking the maintenance of plant biodiversity and agricultural production. Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability.",2016

To investigate the species-specificity between figs and fig pollinators and to further understand the speciation process in obligate mutualisms, we examined the genetic differentiation and phylogenetic relationships of four closely related fig-pollinating wasp species (Blastophaga nipponica, Blastophaga taiwanensis, Blastophaga tannoensis and Blastophaga yeni) in Japan and Taiwan using genome-wide sequence data, including mitochondrial DNA sequences. In addition, population structure was analysed for the fig wasps and their host species using microsatellite data. The results suggest that the three Taiwanese fig wasp species are a single panmictic population that pollinates three dioecious fig species, which are sympatrically distributed, have large differences in morphology and ecology and are also genetically differentiated. Our results illustrate the first case of pollinator sharing by host shift in the subgenus Ficus. On the other hand, there are strict genetic codivergences between allopatric populations of the two host-pollinator pairs. The possible processes that produce these pollinator-sharing events are discussed based on the level and pattern of genetic differentiation in these figs and fig wasps.",2016
"Reproductive resource partitioning in two sympatric Goniothalamus species (Annonaceae) from Borneo: floral biology, pollinator trapping and plant breeding system",,INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER; HONEYBEE APIS-MELLIFERA; BEETLE AETHINA-TUMIDA; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS; RHYNCHOPHORUS-PALMARUM; DIPTEROCARP FOREST; VOLATILES; INTERFERENCE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION,"The floral phenology, pollination ecology and breeding systems of two sympatric early-divergent angiosperms, Goniothalamus tapisoides and G. suaveolens (Annonaceae) are compared. The flowers are protogynous and morphologically similar, with anthesis over 23-25 h. Both species are predominantly xenogamous and pollinated by small beetles: G. tapisoides mainly by Curculionidae and G. suaveolens mainly by Nitidulidae. Coevolution and reproductive resource partitioning, reducing interspecific pollen transfer, is achieved by temporal isolation, due to contrasting floral phenologies; and ethological isolation, due to contrasting floral scents that contain attractants specific to the two beetle families. Analysis of floral scents revealed three volatiles (3-methylbutyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and 2-phenylethanol) that are known to be nitidulid attractants in the floral scent of G. suaveolens, but absent from that of G. tapisoides. An effective pollinator trapping mechanism is demonstrated for both species, representing the first such report for the family. Trapping is achieved by the compression of the outer petals against the apertures between the inner petals. This trapping mechanism is likely to be a key evolutionary innovation for Goniothalamus, increasing pollination efficiency by increasing pollen loading on beetles during the staminate phase, promoting effective interfloral pollinator movements, and increasing seed-set by enabling rapid turn-over of flowers.",2016
Phenology of the multi-use tree species Carapa guianensis in a floodplain forest of the Amazon Estuary,Amazon; Carapa guianensis; crabwood tree ecology; Florestam; Meliaceae; phenology; phenophases; sustainable forest management,SEED; GROWTH,"Carapa guianensis is a multi-use tree species that is used for the production of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that are used and sold by rural Amazonian populations. Here we aimed to evaluate the phenophases of C. guianensis in varzea forest and relate them to climatic seasonality. Phenophases of flowering (flower buds and open flowers), fruiting (unripe and ripe fruits), and leaf flush and leaf fall were recorded for 30 individual trees during a 25 month period. Relationships between rainfall and the proportion of trees in each phenophase were tested using Generalised Linear Models with quasi-binomial errors. Flowering was found to peak in the driest months of the year (September to December), while fruiting peaked during the wettest months of the year when river levels are at their highest (January to May). Leaf flush and leaf fall occurred simultaneously throughout the year, regardless of seasonality. Strong seasonality in flowering and fruiting of C. guianensis likely represents a reproductive strategy that maximizes pollination and hydrochorous seed dispersal. This study has the potential to aid in planning the timing of seed collection and oil extraction activities, thus contributing to the sustainable exploitation of this tree.",2016

It is less well appreciated that pollen morphology may vary within and among populations of the same species as well as within individual plants. In some species, individual plants produce multiple types of fertile pollen grains (called pollen heteromorphism). Aspects of pollen morphology, such as aperture number, are likely to affect fertilization success with different morphologies favored in different local competitive and ecological environments. This study surveys variation in pollen grain morphology among species throughout the genus Thalictrum. Pollen from individuals of 36 species was rehydrated from herbarium specimens, and light microscopy was used to quantify pollen grain aperture number and size. I find that pollen aperture-number heteromorphism is present within all Thalictrum species studied, and distributions of aperture-number morphs vary both within and among species. This study provides an example of significant pollen heteromorphism within a genus that also varies widely for pollination mode and sexual system.",2016
Spatial structure and scaling of agricultural networks,Scaling; Rank-size; Agriculture; Power law; Network,LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; PERSPECTIVE; CLIMATE,"Considering agricultural landscapes as networks can provide information about spatial connectivity relevant for a wide range of applications including pollination, pest management, and ecology. At global scales, spatial networks of agricultural land use inferred from land cover products are well-described by power law rank-size distributions. However, regional analyses of agricultural land use typically focus on subsets of the total global network. In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? Does the observed scale-free structure persist as agricultural networks evolve over the growing season? We analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial variability - but generally still possess similar scaling properties to the global distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results when comparing Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery for 3 agricultural regions in Europe, as well as in an IKONOS image of an agricultural region of China. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity and evolution of complex spatial distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.",2016

Remote sensing may help to quantify and map the resulting patterns for a better understanding of ecosystem functioning. This task is challenging because the signal measured by sensors is dominated by leaf and canopy optical traits that determine the vegetation spectrum. No direct influence of pollination types (i.e. wind, insect and self pollination) can be expected. We limits ask: (1) lion strongly are pollination types at the community level linked with optical traits; and (2) do these links allow us to map spatial patterns of pollination types with remote sensing data? Location: Mires arid Molinia grasslar, southern C.ernmany. Methods: We sampled vascular plant species composition, as well as traits related to optical spectral signals, for 100 plots. Information on pollination types and additional optical traits were compiled from established plant trait databases. Simultaneously with the field sampling, image data of the study site were acquired using the airborne sensor ABA. Dual. We tested for correlations between-pollination types and optical traits. Based on these results, we regressed the plot-based information on pollination types against the corresponding spectral signal extracted.from the image data. We inverted the models using the image in order to obtain maps of the pollination type distribution across the study site. Results: In our study site, pollination types and optical traits were significantly correlated, up to R = 0.813 in the case of wind pollination and leaf dry matter content. These relations are, however, not.necessarily transferable to other ecosystems, phenological stages and spatial scales, and their physical interpretation requires careful consideration. We were able to statistically model the spatial distribution of pollination types with a RMSE < 10.5%. The resulting maps provide detailed insights into the spatial distribution of pollination types at the community level. Conclusions: The results show that pollination types are indeed related to canopy reflectance in a way that allows their mapping using remote sensing. More research is needed in order to improve our knowledge about transferable relations between pollination types and plant traits in other ecosystems and at different phenological stages.",2016
Pesticide seed dressings can affect the activity of various soil organisms and reduce decomposition of plant material,Agricultural intensification; Agroecosystems; Belowground; Difenoconazole; Ecotoxicology; Fludioxonil; Imidacloprid; Pesticides; Prothioconazole; Soil ecology,SINELLA-CURVISETA COLLEMBOLA; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; FOLSOMIA-CANDIDA; EARTHWORMS; PROTOZOA; ECOSYSTEM; BEHAVIOR; BIODIVERSITY,"Background: Seed dressing with pesticides is widely used to protect crop seeds from pest insects and fungal diseases. While there is mounting evidence that especially neonicotinoid seed dressings detrimentally affect insect pollinators, surprisingly little is known on potential side effects on soil biota. We hypothesized that soil organisms would be particularly susceptible to pesticide seed dressings as they get in direct contact with these chemicals. Using microcosms with field soil we investigated, whether seeds treated either with neonicotinoid insecticides or fungicides influence the activity and interaction of earthworms, collembola, protozoa and microorganisms. The full-factorial design consisted of the factor Seed dressing (control vs. insecticide vs. fungicide), Earthworm (no earthworms vs. addition Lumbricus terrestris L.) and collembola (no collembola vs. addition Sinella curviseta Brook). We used commercially available wheat seed material (Triticum aesticum L. cf. Lukullus) at a recommended seeding density of 367 m(-2). Results: Seed dressings (particularly fungicides) increased collembola surface activity, increased the number of protozoa and reduced plant decomposition rate but did not affect earthworm activity. Seed dressings had no influence on wheat growth. Earthworms interactively affected the influence of seed dressings on collembola activity, whereas collembola increased earthworm surface activity but reduced soil basal respiration. Earthworms also decreased wheat growth, reduced soil basal respiration and microbial biomass but increased soil water content and electrical conductivity. Conclusions: The reported non-target effects of seed dressings and their interactions with soil organisms are remarkable because they were observed after a one-time application of only 18 pesticide treated seeds per experimental pot. Because of the increasing use of seed dressing in agriculture and the fundamental role of soil organisms in agro-ecosystems these ecological interactions should receive more attention.",2016
An energetics-based honeybee nectar-foraging model used to assess the potential for landscape-level pesticide exposure dilution,Honeybee; Foraging; Landscape ecology; Pesticide exposure; Energetic efficiency; Flower strips; Semi-natural habitats; Resource selection; Depletion; Nectar content,MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS L; OILSEED RAPE; INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR; POLLINATOR DILUTION; SELF-ORGANIZATION; BRASSICA-NAPUS; BEE; COLONIES; FORAGERS,"Estimating the exposure of honeybees to pesticides on a landscape scale requires models of their spatial foraging behaviour. For this purpose, we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only, net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a small number of patches.",2016

Grassland invertebrate communities are heavily dependent on the plant diversity and production within a given system. Climate change models predict alterations in precipitation patterns, both in terms of the amount of total inputs and the frequency, seasonality and intensity with which these inputs occur, which will impact grassland productivity. Given the ecological, economic and biodiversity value of grasslands, and their importance globally as areas of carbon storage and agricultural development, it is in our interest to understand how predicted alterations in precipitation patterns will affect grasslands and the invertebrate communities they contain. Here, we review the findings from manipulative and observational studies which have examined invertebrate responses to altered rainfall, with a particular focus on large-scale field experiments employing precipitation manipulations. Given the tight associations between invertebrate communities and their underlying plant communities, invertebrate responses to altered precipitation generally mirror those of the plants in the system. However, there is evidence that species responses to future precipitation changes will be idiosyncratic and context dependent across trophic levels, challenging our ability to make reliable predictions about how grassland communities will respond to future climatic changes, without further investigation. Thus, moving forward, we recommend increased consideration of invertebrate communities in current and future rainfall manipulation platforms, as well as the adoption of new technologies to aid such studies.",2016
Floral colour change as a potential signal to pollinators,,WEIGELA-MIDDENDORFFIANA; BUMBLE-BEES; ANTHOCYANINS; ATTRACTION; TRANSITION; FLOWERS,"Colour change in flowers (with age and/or after pollination) is taxonomically widespread, has evolved repeatedly, and has a range of putative selective benefits linked to modifying pollinator behaviour; however, this phenomenon seems paradoxically uncommon. We explore this paradox by reviewing the empirical evidence and argue that the evolution and maintenance of floral colour change as a signal to modify pollinator behaviour require special ecological circumstances that will often not be met across a plant population for a sustained number of generations, which potentially explains the scarcity of this phenomenon. We discuss alternative explanations for floral colour change and potentially fruitful lines of future research.",2016
Flower diversity and bee reproduction in an arid ecosystem,Pollination; Bee fitness; Flower diversity,SOLITARY BEES; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; PLANT; BIODIVERSITY; STABILITY; GRASSLAND; PRODUCTIVITY; POLLINATORS; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION,"Background: Diverse flower communities are more stable in floral resource production along the flowering season, but the question about how the diversity and stability of resources affect pollinator reproduction remains open. High plant diversity could favor short foraging trips, which in turn would enhance bee fitness. In addition to plant diversity, greater temporal stability of floral resources in diverse communities could favor pollinator fitness because such communities are likely to occupy the phenological space more broadly, increasing floral availability for pollinators throughout the season. In addition, this potential effect of flower diversity on bee reproduction could be stronger for generalist pollinators because they can use a broader floral spectrum. Based on above arguments we predicted that pollinator reproduction would be positively correlated to flower diversity, and to temporal stability in flower production, and that this relationship would be stronger for the most generalized pollinator species. Materials and Methods: Using structural equation models, we evaluated the effect of these variables and other ecological factors on three estimates of bee reproduction (average number of brood cells per nest per site, total number of brood cells per site, and total number of nests per site), and whether such effects were modulated by bee generalization on floral resources. Results: Contrary to our expectations, flower diversity had no effect on bee reproduction, stability in flower production had a weakly negative effect on one of the bee reproductive variables, and the strength of the fitness-diversity relationship was unrelated to bee generalization. In contrast, elevation had a negative effect on bee reproduction, despite the narrow elevation range encompassed by our sites. Discussion: Flower diversity did not affect the reproduction of the solitary bees studied here. This result could stem from the context dependence of the diversity-stability relationship, given that elevation had a positive effect on flower diversity but a negative effect on bee reproduction. Although high temporal stability in flower production is expected to enhance pollinator reproduction, in our study it had a weakly negative-instead of positive-effect on the average number of brood cells per nest. Other environmental factors that vary with elevation could influence bee reproduction. Our study focused on a small group of closely-related bee species, which cautions against generalization of our findings to other groups of pollinators. More studies are clearly needed to assess the extent to which pollinator demography is influenced by the diversity of floral resources.",2016
Recent mating-system evolution in Eichhornia is accompanied by cis-regulatory divergence,allele-specific expression (ASE); deleterious mutations; Eichhornia paniculata; evolution of selfing; outcrossing bias; transcriptomes,ALLELE-SPECIFIC EXPRESSION; RNA-SEQ DATA; SELF-FERTILIZATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; PANICULATA PONTEDERIACEAE; ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; GENOMIC CONSEQUENCES; FLOWERING PLANTS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; SEQUENCING DATA,"The evolution of predominant self-fertilization from cross-fertilization in plants is accompanied by diverse changes to morphology, ecology and genetics, some of which likely result from regulatory changes in gene expression. We examined changes in gene expression during early stages in the transition to selfing in populations of animal-pollinated Eichhornia paniculata with contrasting mating patterns. We crossed plants from outcrossing and selfing populations and tested for the presence of allele-specific expression (ASE) in floral buds and leaf tissue of F-1 offspring, indicative of cis-regulatory changes. We identified 1365 genes exhibiting ASE in floral buds and leaf tissue. These genes preferentially expressed alleles from outcrossing parents. Moreover, we found evidence that genes exhibiting ASE had a greater nonsynonymous diversity compared to synonymous diversity in the selfing parents. Our results suggest that the transition from outcrossing to high rates of self-fertilization may have the potential to shape the cis-regulatory genomic landscape of angiosperm species, but that the changes in ASE may be moderate, particularly during the early stages of this transition.",2016

The species is threatened with extinction because of its small number of individuals and the impediments to its reproduction (a combination of protogyny, a short period of stigma receptivity, and a lack of efficient pollinators). To reduce the risk of extinction we conducted two conservation translocation trials: one to augment the sole extant population, and the other 202 km north of the current range. The latter trial was a conservation introduction in which the goals were to increase the population and to buffer against the effects of climate change. We used emerged and grafted seedlings as translocation materials. We compared the survival, growth, and eco-physiological properties of emerged and grafted seedlings at the two sites. The survival rate and growth were higher for grafted seedlings than for emerged seedlings at both sites. Eco-physiological data indicated that grafted seedlings at both sites were as efficient or more so in light and water usage than wild individuals, whereas emerged seedlings were less efficient. Grafted seedlings attained the flowering stage sooner than emerged seedlings. Our study suggests that grafting can facilitate the augmentation and establishment of new populations of M. longipedunculata and perhaps of new populations of other threatened species facing reproductive difficulties and climate change.",2016

We propose the conceptual design and implementation of a database to store, manage, and manipulate phenological time series and associated ecological information and environmental data. The database was developed in the context of the e-phenology project and integrates ground-based conventional plant phenology direct observations with near-surface remote phenology using repeated images from digital cameras. It also includes site-base information, sensor derived data from the study site weather station and plant ecological traits (e.g., pollination and dispersal syndrome, flower and fruit color, and leaf exchange strategy) at individual and species level. We validated the database design through the implementation of a Web application that generates the time series based on queries, exemplified in two case studies investigating: the relationship between flowering phenology and local weather; and the consistency between leafing patterns derived from ground-based phenology on leaf flush and from vegetation image indices (%Green). The database will store all the information produced in the e-phenology project, monitoring of 12 sites from cerrado savanna to rainforest, and will aggregate the legacy information of other studies developed in the Phenology Laboratory (UNESP, Rio Claro, Brazil) over the last 20 years. We demonstrate that our database is a powerful tool that can be widely used to manage complex temporal datasets, integrating legacy and live phenological information from diverse sources (e.g., conventional, digital cameras, seed traps) and temporal scales, improving our capability of producing scientific and applied information on tropical phenology.

Leaf Fertilizers Affect Survival and Behavior of the Neotropical Stingless Bee Friesella schrottkyi (Meliponini: Apidae: Hymenoptera),heavy metal; native pollinator; fertilizer toxicity; risk assessment; nontarget effect,REDUCED-RISK INSECTICIDES; HONEY-BEE; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE BEES; QUADRIFASCIATA; HORMESIS; METALS; ACCUMULATION; PERSPECTIVES; POPULATIONS,"The ongoing concern about bee decline has largely focused on honey bees and neonicotinoid insecticides, while native pollinators such as Neotropical stingless bees and agrochemicals such as other insecticide groups, pesticides in general, and fertilizers-especially leaf fertilizers-remain neglected as potential contributors to pollination decline. In an effort to explore this knowledge gap, we assessed the lethal and sublethal behavioral impact of heavy metal-containing leaf fertilizers in a native pollinator of ecological importance in the Neotropics: the stingless bee Friesella schrottkyi (Friese). Two leaf fertilizers-copper sulfate (24% Cu) and a micronutrient mix (Arrank L: 5% S, 5% Zn, 3% Mn, 0.6% Cu, 0.5% B, and 0.06% Mo)-were used in oral and contact exposure bioassays. The biopesticide spinosad and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Copper sulfate compromised the survival of stingless bee workers, particularly with oral exposure, although less than spinosad under contact exposure. Sublethal exposure to both leaf fertilizers at their field rates also caused significant effects in exposed workers. Copper sulfate enhanced flight take-off on stingless bee workers, unlike workers exposed to the micronutrient mix. There was no significant effect of leaf fertilizers on the overall activity and walking behavior of worker bees. No significant effect was observed for the respiration rate of worker bees under contact exposure, but workers orally exposed to the micronutrient mix exhibited a reduced respiration rate. Therefore, leaf fertilizers do affect F. schrottkyi, what may also occur with other stingless bees, potentially compromising their pollination activity deserving attention.",2016

Asclepiads (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadoideae subtribe Asclepiadinae) represent a diverse group in South African grasslands, but the scents of most species remain unexplored and few genera are sufficiently sampled to allow comparisons between congeners. I used dynamic headspace extraction methods and coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine the scent chemistry of three unusually scented asclepiads in the genus Xysmalobium and then combined these data with previously published data to explore inter-and intraspecific variation in the genus. A total of 74 compounds (33-44 per species) from various compound classes were detected in the species examined here. The sweet but faintly foetid scent of Xysmalobium asperum was dominated by epoxy oxoisophorone in combination with various other terpenoids and aromatics, and small amounts of p-cresol. The sweat-like scent of Xysmalobium tysonianum was dominated by a few aromatics in combination with isovaleric acid and several aliphatic compounds normally associated with microbial degradation or fermentation. The semen-like scent of Xysmalobium parviflorum flowers examined here contained large relative amounts of 1-pyrroline, and comparison with previously published data for dung-scented flowers from a different population revealed clear divergence in the relative amounts of this compound and p-cresol. I also detected 25 compounds that were not shared between the two X. parviflorum populations. Comparison of scent data for eight Xysmalobium species revealed very distinct chemical profiles with limited overlap between species. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of these volatiles as pollinator attractants and the evolution of floral scents within the genus.  ",2016

Starting from the Neogene, the European climate was subjected to severe alterations. Nevertheless, several genera, including Berardia, survived these climatic changes. Despite the numerous studies performed about the relationship between climate change and plant reproductive biology, equivalent studies on ancient species are lacking, even though they may furnish crucial information on the strategies that allowed them to survive drastic climatic fluctuations. We investigated floral and reproductive features in Berardia subacaulis (Asteraceae), describing pollen vectors, capitulum and florets phenology, evaluating reproductive efficiency and defining the reproductive mode of the plant with bagging experiments and test of apomixis. B. subacaulis grows in habitats with low pollination services; it is self-compatible, but many typical features favouring cross-pollination are still present: florets are characterized by incomplete protandry, capitulum protogyny and high pollen-ovule ratio. The plant is not apomictic and self-fertilization is allowed within each capitulum. Similarly to other European Alpine endemics supposed to belong to the Mediterranean ancient tropical flora, the reproductive mode observed in the monospecific genus Berardia assured reproduction also under a pollinator decline. Differently from the other endemics, it took advantage of its spontaneous self-pollination and compatibility and its generalist pollination service, common both among high altitude plants and in the Asteraceae.",2016

However, until now, their micromorphology, anatomy and ultrastructure have not been investigated, nor have the natures and possible functions of their exudates. Our aim was to investigate distribution, ontogenesis, structure, and secretion mechanisms of glands of Barbacenia flava and Vellozia intermedia and to discuss their possible ecological functions. Samples were prepared according to standard methods for investigations of plant anatomy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Histochemical tests were performed, and focal field observations were made in the study site. The capitate stalked glands on the pedicel, tepals and hypanthium are covered by a sticky secretion that is released in the gland head through the outer periclinal cell walls and cuticle. Secretions are produced in the epidermal and subepidermal cells that contain structural components typical of mixed, mainly lipophilic secretions. Bacteria were found inside the oil-resin gland cells of both species. The Meliponina bees Trigona spinipes and Tetragonisca angustula were observed collecting resin from both species, but were not involved in pollination. Our observations clearly indicate that flower glands of B. flava and V. intermedia are oil-resin secreting and remain active in secretion from very young buds, through to immature fruit. New, smaller glands replace senescent glands by divisions near the base of the original stalk cells. Oil-resin glands have a number of different, but important functions, including the interaction with Meliponina bees, protection against water loss and high temperatures by ultraviolet screening, and anti-desiccant properties.",2016

The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is the most important pollinator in agriculture worldwide. However, the number of honey bees has fallen significantly since 2006, becoming a huge ecological problem nowadays. The principal cause is CCD, or Colony Collapse Disorder, characterized by the seemingly spontaneous abandonment of hives by their workers. One of the characteristics of CCD in honey bees is the alteration of the bacterial communities in their gastrointestinal tract, mainly due to the decrease of Firimicutes populations, such as the Lactobacilli. At this time, the causes of these alterations remain unknown. We recently isolated a strain of Lactobacillus kunkeei (L. kunkeei strain MP2) from the gut of Chilean honey bees. L. kunkeei, is f the most commonly isolated bacterium from highly,' the honey bee gut and is high one oversatile in different ecological niches. In this study, we aimed to elucidate in detail, the L. kurikeei genetic background and perform a comparative genome analysis with other Lactobacillus species. Methods. L. kunkeei MP2 was originally isolated from the guts of Chilean A. mellifera individuals. Genome sequencing was done using Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing technology. De novo assembly was performed using Celera assembler. The genome was annotated using Prold(a, and functional information was added using the EggNOG 3.1 database. In addition, genomic islands were predicted using IslandViewer, and pro-phage sequences using PHAST. Comparisons between L. kunkeei MP2 with other L. kunkeei, and Lactobacillus strains were done using Roary. Results. The complete genorne of L. kunkeei MP2 comprises one circular chromosome of 1,614,522 rit. with a GC content of 36,9%. Pangenome analysis with 16 L. kunkeei strains, identified 113 unique genes, most of them related to phage insertions. A large and unique region of L. kunkeei MP2 genome contains several genes that encode for phage structural protein and replication components. Comparative analysis of MP2' with other Lactobacillus species, identified several unique genes of L. kunkeei MP2 related with metabolism, biofilm generation, survival under stress conditions, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Discussion. The presence of multiple mobile genetic elements, including phage sequences, suggest a high degree of genetic variability in L. kunkeei. Its versatility and ability to survive in different ecological niches L (bee guts, flowers, fruits among others) could be given by its genetic capacity to change and adapt to different environments L. kunkeei could be a new source of Lactobacillus with beneficial properties. Indeed, L. kunkeei MP2 could play an important role in synthesis of components as isoprenoids.",2016

Whether T.sinensis is functionally androdioecious is unknown. In this study, we compare the male fitness between male and hermaphrodite individuals and perform pollination experiments in different habitats, identify the ability of actual siring of pollen from hermaphrodites and males under natural pollination, and discuss the evolution and maintenance of androdioecy in T.sinensis. Research suggests that flowers and fruits grow synchronously on hermaphrodite plants of T.sinensis from April to June. The males of T.sinensis had more than twice the genetic contribution of hermaphrodites through their male function and the fruit set from male pollination and cross-pollination was the highest in all of the treatments, whereas that from self-pollination was the lowest. Additionally, paternity analysis showed that the hermaphroditic pollen could result in siring success under natural pollination. The results showed that T.sinensis is a functionally androdioecious tree, that male individuals might evolve from a hermaphroditic ancestor and that the synchronous growth of flowers and fruit in hermaphrodites might facilitate the evolution and maintenance of androdioecy in T.sinensis.",2016

A large number of hybrids and open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] have been released and/or commercialized in India. Eighteen OPVs and 15 high-Fe candidate hybrids were evaluated in multi-location trials for Fe and Zn density to identify those with high density of these micronutrients. The Fe density in OPVs varied from 42 mg/kg to 67 mg/kg, and Zn density from 37 mg/kg to 52 mg/kg with ICTP 8203 having the highest Fe density (67 mg/kg) followed by ICMV 221 (61 mg/kg) and AIMP 92901 (56 mg/kg). While ICTP 8203 had also the highest level of Zn density (52 mg/kg), ICMV 221 and AIMP 92901 had 45-46 mg/kg Zn density. The Fe density in hybrids varied from 46 mg/kg to 56 mg/kg and Zn density from 37 mg/kg to 44 mg/kg. Four hybrids, viz.

To determine these indirect interactions and understand better community dynamics, ecologists focused on the interactions within small sets of species or modules. Thanks to their analytical tractability, modules bring insights on the mechanisms occurring in complex interaction networks. So far, most studies have considered modules with a single type of interaction although numerous species are involved in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions simultaneously. In this study, we analyse the dynamics of a diamond-shaped module with multiple interaction types: two resource species sharing a mutualist and a consumer. We describe the different types of indirect interaction occurring between the resource species and the conditions for a stable coexistence of all species. We show that the nature of indirect interactions between resource species (i.e. apparent facilitation, competition or antagonism), as well as stable coexistence, depend on the species generalism and asymmetry of interactions, or in other words, on the distribution of interaction strengths among species. We further unveil that a balance between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions at the level of resource species favours stable coexistence, and that species are more likely to coexist stably if there is apparent facilitation between the two resource species rather than apparent competition. Our results echo existing knowledge on the trophic diamond-shaped module, and confirm that our understanding of communities combining different interaction types can gain from module analyses.",2016

Attributes of resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural establishment of both F-1 hybrids (n = 3) and advanced generation hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi. Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F-1 trees at the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of a seed crop from one F-1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F-1 in some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C henryi parent is favoured (60%), whereas selfing (10%) and crossing with other F-1 (30%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably accounted for long distance dispersal from C torelliana, but this mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from the F-1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour, controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the planted F-1 hybrid. If large sources of F-1 pollen become available to compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival inhibits on-going gene flow.    ",2016

Hybrids may resemble the parental species in their ecology, leading to competition and/or gene introgression; alternatively, they may diverge from the parental phenotypes, possibly leading to the colonisation of new ecological niches and to speciation. Here, we describe inflorescence morphology, ploidy levels, pollinator attractive scents, and pollinator guilds of natural hybrids of Arum italicum and A. maculatum (Araceae) from a site with sympatric parental populations in southern France to determine how these traits affect the hybrid pollination ecology. Hybrids were characterised by inflorescences with a size and a number of flowers more similar to A. italicum than to A. maculatum. In most cases, hybrid stamens were purple, as in A. maculatum, and spadix appendices yellow, as in A. italicum. Hybrid floral scent was closer to that of A. italicum, but shared some compounds with A. maculatum and comprised unique compounds. Also, the pollinator guild of the hybrids was similar to that of A. italicum. Nevertheless, the hybrids attracted a high proportion of individuals of the main pollinator of A. maculatum. We discuss the effects of hybridisation in sympatric parental zones in which hybrids exhibit low levels of reproductive success, the establishment of reproductive barriers between parental species, the role of the composition of floral attractive scents in the differential attraction of pollinators and in the competition between hybrids and their parental species, and the potential of hybridisation to give rise to new independent lineages.",2016

For instance, wavelength discrimination thresholds have been determined in two species only: the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the butterfly Papilio xuthus. Here, we present the wavelength discrimination thresholds (Delta lambda) for the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. We compared the data with those found for the honeybee, the butterfly P. xuthus and the predictions of a colour discrimination model. After training moths to feed from a rewarded disc illuminated with a monochromatic light, we tested them in a dual-choice situation, in which they had to choose between light of the training wavelength and a novel unrewarded wavelength. To characterise the Delta lambda function, we decreased the difference between wavelengths in subsequent tests. We also varied the light intensity to test its effect on the discrimination capacity. In agreement with the predictions of the model, we found two expected minima of discrimination where photoreceptor sensitivities overlap, as well as a third, minor, unpredicted minimum around the peak of the blue photoreceptor. Macroglossum stellatarum is capable of discriminating between lights with a wavelength difference of 1-2 nm. These discrimination minima are similar to those found for the tetrachromatic P. xuthus, and are better than those of the honeybee. The moth is also capable of using achromatic information to discriminate between lights of long wavelengths.",2016

Contrasting patterns of genetic variation in core and peripheral populations of highly outcrossing and wind pollinated forest tree species,Demographic history; genetic structure; glacial refugia; phylogeography; Pinus sylvestris; population history; recolonization,PINUS-SYLVESTRIS L.; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; SCOTS PINE; GLACIAL REFUGIA; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; DIFFERENTIATION; CONSEQUENCES; DIVERSITY,"Gene flow tends to have a homogenising effect on a species' background genetic variation over large geographical areas. However, it is usually unknown to what extent the genetic structure of populations is influenced by gene exchange between core and peripheral populations that may represent stands of different evolutionary and demographic history. In this study, we looked at the patterns of population differentiation in Scots pine-a highly outcrossing and wind pollinated conifer species that forms large ecosystems of great ecological and economic importance in Europe and Asia. A set of 13 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci was analysed to infer the genetic relationships among 24 populations (676 individuals) from Europe and Asia Minor. The study included specimens from the primary continuous range and from isolated, marginal stands that are considered to be autochthonous populations representative of the species' putative refugial areas. Despite their presumably different histories, a similar level of genetic variation and no evidence of a population bottleneck was found across the populations. Differentiation among populations was relatively low (average F-ST = 0.035); however, the population structure was not homogenous, which was clearly evident from the allelic frequency spectra and Bayesian assignment analysis. Significant differentiation over short geographical distances was observed between isolated populations within the Iberian and Anatolian Peninsulas (Asia Minor), which contrasted with the absence of genetic differentiation observed between distant populations e.g., between central and northern Europe. The analysed populations were assigned to several groups that corresponded to the geographical regions of their occurrence. These results will be useful in genetics studies in Scots pine that aim to link nucleotide and phenotypic variation across the species distribution range and for development of sustainable breeding and management programs.",2016

However, increasing model sophistication and accuracyand therefore complexity-may trade-off with ease of use and applicability to real-world decision-making contexts, so it is vital to incorporate the lessons learned from implementation efforts into new model development. Using successful implementation efforts for guidance, we developed an integrated ES modelling system to quantify several ecosystem services: forest timber production and carbon storage, water purification, pollination, and biodiversity. The system is designed to facilitate uptake of ES information into land-use decisions through three principal considerations: (1) using relatively straightforward models that can be readily deployed and interpreted without specialized expertise; (2) using an agent-based modelling framework to enable the incorporation of human decision-making directly within the model; and (3) integration among all ES models to simultaneously demonstrate the effects of a single land-use decision on multiple ES. We present an implementation of the model for a major watershed in Alberta, Canada, and highlight the system's capabilities to assess a suite of ES under future management decisions, including forestry activities under two alternative timber harvest strategies, and through a scenario modelling analysis exploring different intensities of hypothetical agricultural expansion. By using a modular approach, the modelling system can be readily expanded to evaluate additional ecosystem services or management questions of interest in order to guide land-use decisions to achieve socioeconomic and environmental objectives.",2016
Few Ant Species Play a Central Role Linking Different Plant Resources in a Network in Rupestrian Grasslands,,RAIN-FOREST; EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; POLLINATION NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; COMPLEX COMMUNITIES; NEOTROPICAL SAVANNA; HONEYDEW; SPECIALIZATION; NECTAR,"Ant-plant associations are an outstanding model to study the entangled ecological interactions that structure communities. However, most studies of plant-animal networks focus on only one type of resource that mediates these interactions (e.g, nectar or fruits), leading to a biased understanding of community structure. New approaches, however, have made possible to study several interaction types simultaneously through multilayer networks models. Here, we use this approach to ask whether the structural patterns described to date for ant plant networks hold when multiple interactions with plant-derived food rewards are considered. We tested whether networks characterized by different resource types differ in specialization and resource partitioning among ants, and whether the identity of the core ant species is similar among resource types. We monitored ant interactions with extrafloral nectaries, flowers, and fruits, as well as trophobiont hemipterans feeding on plants, for one year, in seven rupestrian grassland (campo rupestre) sites in southeastern Brazil. We found a highly tangled ant-plant network in which plants offering different resource types are connected by a few central ant species. The multilayer network had low modularity and specialization, but ant specialization and niche overlap differed according to the type of resource used. Beyond detecting structural differences across networks, our study demonstrates empirically that the core of most central ant species is similar across them. We suggest that foraging strategies of ant species, such as massive recruitment, may determine specialization and resource partitioning in ant-plant interactions. As this core of ant species is involved in multiple ecosystem functions, it may drive the diversity and evolution of the entire campo rupestre community.",2016

Recent agricultural land expansion, however, not only causes its dwindling population size, but also poses a severe threat to its long-term persistence. Since our knowledge of the reproductive biology of P. delavayi is very limited, and some management misconceptions have further exacerbated the already worrisome situation, the aim of the present study is to provide some scientific evidence regarding habitat preference and breeding system of P. delavayi, and to help correct some management misconceptions. Specifically, morphological traits of P. delavayi populations growing in two different habitats (i.e., the open area versus forest understory), including basal stem diameter, plant height and flower numbers per plant, were measured and compared with each other. A range of floral manipulation experiments was further conducted to study the extent of self-compatibility and pollen limitation. The results showed that P. delavayi preferred the open habitat over forest understory as it generally grew bigger with thicker stems, and produced a higher number of flowers in the former habitat. Therefore, the open habitat should receive immediate priority for conservation action instead of being converted to agricultural land; also, P. delavayi is pollen limited, as evidenced by the fact that experimental flowers receiving supplemental non-self pollen generally displayed elevated seed production than flowers subjected to other treatments (e.g., non-supplemental self pollen, non-supplemental non-self pollen and supplemental self pollen), which is consistent with reported observations that alpine plants are more likely to be pollen-limited than lowland plants. We suggest that human intervention might be necessary to guarantee the long-term persistence of P. delavayi as harsh alpine environment, intense competition for pollinators and different anthropogenic perturbations co-limit its reproductive success.",2016

The main objective of this work was to study five Tetrapus morphotypes, whose females have two mandibular appendages and the males are hexapodous, their fig host association and phylogenetic position to the family Agaonidae. The question of which group of fig pollinating wasps and associated figs are the sister to the rest of the pollinating agaonids, and figs respectively remain open. I report a group of New World extant Tetrapus morphotypes (Agaonidae: Agaoninae) provisionally assigned to Hexapus subg. nov. in preparation. Currently, Tetrapus appears as the sister taxon to all other fig pollinating taxa. Howeveer, morphologically, ecologically, geographically and historically Hexapus seems to be the ancestral Glade of the extant Agaoninae. Hexapus morphotypes develop in fig species of subsection Petenenses (section Pharmacosycea). In the known extant Tetrapus, the females have one mandibular appendage and the males have reduced one or two short-lobe atrophied non-functional midlegs (tetrapodous). Hexapus females have two free mandibular appendages, and the males have five segmented functional mid-legs (hexapodous). Molecularly Hexapus seems to be the ancestral Glade of extant Agaoninae; e.g., a Tetrapus sp. of Ficus crassivenosa was placed by other author as the ancestral Glade of 101 wasp species, representing 19 worldwide Agaoninae genera, including four Tetrapus species. In Tetrapus sp. of Ficus crassivenosa, the female has two mandibular appendages and the male is hexapodous. The females of T apopnus and T deklosi, preserved in Early to mid-Miocene amber from the Dominican Republic, also have two mandibular appendages and the general morphology of extant Hexapus. I suggest that Hexapus stands up as a living fossil and the sister Glade of Tetrapus s.s. The presence of extant Hexapus; as well as extant Tetrapus and their fig host species, especially in South America supports a Southern Gondwanaland origin for both of them, but not a trans-Pacific migrating connection with tropical America for section Pharmacosycea (the host of Tetrapus and Hexapus), a long oceanic dispersal, high levels of stem extinction of Tetrapus or Atlantic land connections, as proposed by other authors. However, lastly it has been assumed that figs and their pollinators arose simultaneously in Eurasia during early Tertiary and spread southwards from it. Most of the morphological and molecular studies of the fig biology of Agaoninae and Ficus, did not include Hexapus morphotypes and their fig hosts, and assumed that Tetrapus is the most ancestral Glade of the extant fig pollinating wasps.",2016
Bumble bee species exhibit divergent responses to urbanisation in a Southern California landscape,Apoidea; Bombus; GIS; pollinator; spatial scale,BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; COLONY GROWTH; HABITAT FRAGMENTS; HONEY-BEE; HYMENOPTERA; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; APIDAE; SCALE; DECLINE,"1. Bees are ecologically important pollinators that are threatened by disease, habitat degradation, and habitat loss. Bee species that share ecological traits (e.g. body size, diet breadth, and sociality) may often respond similarly to environmental disturbance; however, few studies have examined the extent to which closely related, ecologically similar species exhibit divergent responses to the same forms of disturbance. 2. In the present study, the responses of bumble bees (Apidae: genus Bombus) to urbanization are examined by combining field surveys with the quantification of localand landscape-level variables using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). During the spring and summer of 2012 and 2013, 57, bumble bees were surveyed in 1-ha plots in San Diego County, California that spanned a gradient of urbanisation. Species-level, occurrence (presence/absence) data and logistic regressions were then used to identify determinants of Bombus occurrence across this landscape. 3. Approximately 1000 Bombus individuals belonging to three species were observed: B. californicus Smith, B. melanopygus Cresson, and B. vosnesenskii Radoszkowski. The occurrence of all Bombus species was negatively related to impermeable surface cover within study plots, but species responded uniquely to other plot-scale variables and exhibited distinctive patterns of scale-dependency with respect to impermeable surface cover surrounding plots. 4. Urbanisation negatively affected all three focal bumble bee species in this study. Species-specific responses to plot-scale and landscape-scale variables presumably reflect interspecific trait differences (e.g. body size, tongue length, and foraging behaviour). Unique responses to urbanisation caution against pooling species into functional groups based merely on taxonomic relationships or perceived ecological similarities.",2016
Potential mechanisms of coexistence in closely related forbs,,LIMITING SIMILARITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; LONG-TERM; MORPHOPHYSIOLOGICAL DORMANCY; INTRASPECIFIC FACILITATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; PLANT COMMUNITY; DESERT ANNUALS; COMPETITION; ENVIRONMENTS,"The stable coexistence of very similar species has perplexed ecologists for decades and has been central to the development of coexistence theory. According to modern coexistence theory, species can coexist stably (i.e. persist indefinitely with no long-term density trends) as long as species' niche differences exceed competitive ability differences, even if these differences are very small. Recent studies have directly quantified niche and competitive ability differences in experimental communities at small spatial scales, but provide limited information about stable coexistence across spatial scales in heterogeneous natural communities. In this study, we use experimental and observational approaches to explore evidence for niche and competitive ability differences between two closely related, ecologically similar and widely coexisting annual forbs: Trachymene cyanopetala and T. ornata. We experimentally tested for stabilizing niche differences and competitive ability differences between these species by manipulating species' frequencies, under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. We considered these experimental results in light of extensive field observations to explore evidence of niche segregation at a range of spatial scales. We found little evidence of intra-specific stabilization or competitive ability differences in laboratory experiments while observational studies suggested niche segregation across pollinator assemblages and small-scale microclimate heterogeneity. Though we did not quantify long-term stabilization of coexisting populations of these species, results are consistent with expectations for stable coexistence of similar species via a spatial storage effect allowing niche differences to overcome even small (to absent) competitive ability differences.",2016
"Selection for predation, not female fecundity, explains sexual size dimorphism in the orchid mantises",,PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; POLLINATOR DECEPTION; HYMENOPUS-CORONATUS; TROPHIC MORPHOLOGY; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; ECOLOGICAL CAUSES; CHEMICAL MIMICRY; HUNTING TACTICS; SPIDERS ARANEAE; EVOLUTION,"Here we reconstruct the evolutionary shift towards floral simulation in orchid mantises and suggest female predatory selection as the likely driving force behind the development of extreme sexual size dimorphism. Through analysis of body size data and phylogenetic modelling of trait evolution, we recovered an ancestral shift towards sexual dimorphisms in both size and appearance in a lineage of flower-associated praying mantises. Sedentary female flower mantises dramatically increased in size prior to a transition from camouflaged, ambush predation to a floral simulation strategy, gaining access to, and visually attracting, a novel resource: large pollinating insects. Male flower mantises, however, remained small and mobile to facilitate mate-finding and reproductive success, consistent with ancestral male life strategy. Although moderate sexual size dimorphisms are common in many arthropod lineages, the predominant explanation is female size increase for increased fecundity. However, sex-dependent selective pressures acting outside of female fecundity have been suggested as mechanisms behind niche dimorphisms. Our hypothesised role of predatory selection acting on females to generate both extreme sexual size dimorphism coupled with niche dimorphism is novel among arthropods.",2016

The floral organization, breeding system and pollination ecology of Ferula jaeschkeana Vatke, being unclear, were investigated for the first time with a conservation perspective. Our investigation revealed the andromonoecious nature of Ferula jaeschkeana. The pollen-ovule ratio of the species suggests that the species is an outbreeder. The pollen grains were prolate in shape with few striations. A bagging experiment designed to check the nature of the breeding system and mode of pollination revealed the occurrence of a mixed-mating system with both xenogamous and geitonogamous modes of pollination with no indication of agamospermy. The self-incompatibility rate values suggested that the species is self-compatible. Our observations also indicate the occurrence of ambophily in the species, with both insects (entomophily) and wind (anemophily) acting as the agents of pollination. The formation of aborted ovules resulted in poor fruit set in upper branches. Some of these fruits were hollow or with aborted seeds. In lower branches, completely nonfunctional female structures were present and thus no fruit set was observed. The endangered status and restricted distribution of this species may be partly due to the monocarpy, abortion of ovules, formation of lower nonfunctional central umbels, low seed viability and harsh environmental conditions negatively impacting reproduction in natural populations. Our results present a detailed account on reproductive biology of this valuable medicinal plant species, which may in turn help in its conservation and management.",2016
Past changes in the vegetation density of the Chinese Loess Plateau revealed by variations in the size of Artemisia pollen grains,Pollen size; Biological change; Loess; Artemisia; Climate change,OVULE RATIO; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; NUMBER; MECHANISMS; RECORDS; SYSTEM; SEEDS; AREA,"We reconstructed paleovegetation changes on the Chinese Loess Plateau by applying concepts in palynology and pollination biology to the statistical analysis of the size of Artemisia pollen grains from 26 surface samples, four loess paleosoil profiles, and extant Artemisia species. We found that the size of Artemisia pollen grains varied in different plant communities, and was positively correlated with local habitat quality and population density of local Artemisia communities. The Mean Artemisia Pollen Size (MAPS), which has changed significantly since Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3), reflects integrated ecological changes, including compositional changes and shifts in population density. During MIS3, the high MAPS values indicate that high population densities of Artemisia grassland covered the northern and southern Loess Plateau. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), with much less favorable growing conditions, a low MAPS value indicates that lower-density short grass steppe covered the Loess Plateau at that time. Overall, the results demonstrate that a statistical analysis of the size of fossil pollen grains at genus level can provide useful ecological information, e.g., on changes in the composition and population density of local communities, and thus can lead to a better understanding of the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems.

High Correlated Paternity Leads to Negative Effects on Progeny Performance in Two Mediterranean Shrub Species,,ECOLOGICAL MATERNAL NEIGHBORHOOD; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; PISTACIA-LENTISCUS; MATING PATTERNS; MYRTUS-COMMUNIS; FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; POLLEN LIMITATION; DISPERSAL,"Anthropogenic habitat deterioration can promote changes in plant mating systems that subsequently may affect progeny performance, thereby conditioning plant recruitment for the next generation. However, very few studies yet tested mating system parameters other than outcrossing rates; and the direct effects of the genetic diversity of the pollen received by maternal plants (i.e. correlated paternity) has often been overlooked. In this study, we investigated the relation between correlated paternity and progeny performance in two common Mediterranean shrubs, Myrtus communis and Pistacia lentiscus. To do so, we collected open-pollinated progeny from selected maternal plants, calculated mating system parameters using microsatellite genotyping and conducted sowing experiments under greenhouse and field conditions. Our results showed that some progeny fitness components were negatively affected by the high correlated paternity of maternal plants. In Myrtus communis, high correlated paternity had a negative effect on the proportion and timing of seedling emergence in the natural field conditions and in the greenhouse sowing experiment, respectively. In Pistacia lentiscus, seedling emergence time under field conditions was also negatively influenced by high correlated paternity and a progeny survival analysis in the field experiment showed greater mortality of seedlings from maternal plants with high correlated paternity. Overall, we found effects of correlated paternity on the progeny performance of Myrtus communis, a self-compatible species. Further, we also detected effects of correlated paternity on the progeny emergence time and survival in Pistacia lentiscus, an obligate out-crossed species. This study represents one of the few existing empirical examples which highlight the influence that correlated paternity may exert on progeny performance in multiple stages during early seedling growth.",2016

Here we present the first study of P. montana in South Africa. We found only seven P. montana populations covering an estimated condensed area of 74 hectares during the height of the growing season. Based on a species distribution model, it appears that large parts of the globe are suitable, including parts of the eastern escarpment of South Africa (where most populations occur). South African populations of P. montana appear to have a similar ecology to populations in the USA: high growth rates, low seed germination, no natural long-distance dispersal, little herbivory and vigorous post-fire resprouting. In contrast to the USA, most South African populations do flower and flowers are capable of producing seed in the absence of pollinators. However, P. montana appears to have never been widely planted in South Africa, and the incursion was for many years restricted to a single introduction site. The comparison between the invasions of P. montana in the USA and South Africa highlights the often overriding importance of human-assisted dispersal and cultivation in creating widespread invasions, and should serve as a warning to people who have proposed to utilize the species in Africa.",2016

Although the possible ecological impacts of this invasive species have been intensely discussed with respect to hybridization, we know little about the consequences of this nearly 30-year period of commercialization. We examined and compared the developmental characteristics of native and commercial colonies and their first-generation hybrids under the same laboratory conditions. Young queens and males produced in both native and commercial colonies were mated to generate four genotype groups: Native x Native (N-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N-), Native x Commercial (N-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C-), Commercial x Commercial (C-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C-), and Commercial x Native (C-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N-). The commercial genotype produced significantly more gynes and workers than did the native genotype. However, average gyne number of N-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N- was not significantly different from the pooled N-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C- and C-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N-. The commercial genotype constructed more egg cells in the first brood and commenced egg laying earlier. Hybridization between commercial and native genotypes generally resulted in intermediate expression of the colony traits. Our data suggest that the maternal genotype primarily determines these colony traits. Our results imply that hybridization with the commercial genotype affected some colony traits of native B. terrestris colonies.",2016

The last comprehensive analysis of threats facing rare plants in the United States was conducted nearly 20 years ago. Here we systematically analyze the threats facing 2733 rare and vulnerable plants in the US using textual analysis of the most comprehensive database available. In the continental US plants are most commonly threatened by outdoor recreation (affecting 35% of species), especially from off-road vehicles (19%) and hiking and related activities (13%). The next-most common threats are from livestock (33%), residential development (28%), non-native invasives (27%), and roads (21%). In Hawaii invasives threaten 95% of species followed by increases in fire intensity/frequency (26%) then livestock (19%). Multivariate analyses indicate threats do not form distinct ""syndromes"" (clusters of threats) but rather a single ""mega-syndrome"" with high degrees of overlap between most threats. We also compared the prevalence of threats to the distribution of research effort. Nearly 75% of threats are understudied relative to their prevalence, including five of the six most common threats while a few rare threats (missing species like pollinators; pathogens; logging; climate-induced ecosystem movement; and crop-based agriculture) receive most of the attention. In comparison to a benchmark assessment from 1998 (Wilcove et al. BioScience 48:607-615) we find little difference in threat prevalence, though temporal trends suggest increasing frequency of nearly all threats. Overall rare plants in the US are affected by a dense network of threats across which research attention is disproportionately directed.  ",2016
Natural history matters: how biological constraints shape diversified interactions in pollination networks,,FLOWERS; EVOLUTION,"Species-specific traits and life-history characteristics constrain the ways organisms interact in nature. For example, gape-limited predators are constrained in the sizes of prey they can handle and efficiently consume. When we consider the ubiquity of such constrains, it is evident how hard it can be to be a generalist partner in ecological interactions: a free-living animal or plant cannot simply interact with every available partner it encounters. Some pairwise interactions among coexisting species simply do not occur; they are impossible to observe despite the fact that partners coexist in the same place. Sazatornil et al. (2016) explore the nature of such constraints in the mutualisms among hawkmoths and the plants they pollinate. In this iconic interaction, used by Darwin and Wallace to vividly illustrate the power of natural selection in shaping evolutionary change, both pollinators and plants are sharply constrained in their interaction modes and outcomes.",2016

We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1.5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement of the apiary to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two of the six apiaries showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one of these apiaries showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average number of viruses. These results highlight the importance of environmental factors and good sanitary practices to maximize apiary health and honey productivity.",2016
Spatial Distribution of Flower Color Induced by Interspecific Sexual Interaction,,REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE; GENE FLOW; POLLINATION; COMPETITION; IRIDACEAE; SELECTION; POLLEN; PLANT; DIFFERENTIATION; POLYMORPHISM,"Understanding the mechanisms shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of species has long been a central concern of ecology and evolutionary biology. Contemporary patterns of plant assemblies suggest that sexual interactions among species, i.e., reproductive interference, lead to the exclusive distributions of closely related species that share pollinators. However, the fitness consequences and the initial ecological/evolutionary responses to reproductive interference remain unclear in nature, since reproductive isolation or allopatric distribution has already been achieved in the natural community. In Japan, three species of blue-eyed grasses (Sisyrinchium) with incomplete reproductive isolation have recently colonized and occur sympatrically. Two of them are monomorphic with white flowers, whereas the other exhibits heritable color polymorphism (white and purple morphs). Here we investigated the effects of the presence of two monomorphic species on the distribution and reproductive success of color morphs. The frequency and reproductive success of white morphs decreased in area where monomorphic species were abundant, while those of purple morphs did not. The rate of hybridization between species was higher in white morphs than in the purple ones. Resource competition and habitat preference seemed not to contribute to the spatial distribution and reproductive success of two morphs. Our results supported that color-dependent reproductive interference determines the distribution of flower color polymorphism in a habitat, implying ecological sorting promoted by pollinator-mediated reproductive interference. Our study helps us to understand the evolution and spatial structure of flower color in a community.",2016

We present a pollen flow model for maize (Zea mays), a major staple crop in Africa. We use spatial properties of fields (size, position) in three small-scale maize farming communities in Zambia and estimate rates of cross-fertilisation between fields sown with different maize varieties (e.g. conventional and transgene). As an additional factor contributing to gene flow, we present data on seed saving and sharing among farmers that live in the same communities. Our results show that: i) maize fields were small and located in immediate vicinity of neighboring fields; ii) a majority of farmers saved and shared seed; iii) modeled rates of pollen-mediated gene flow showed extensive mixing of germplasm between fields and farms and iv) as a result, segregation of GM and non-GM varieties is not likely to be an option in these systems. We conclude that the overall genetic composition of maize, in this and similar agricultural contexts, will be strongly influenced both by self-organised ecological factors (pollen flow), and by socially mediated intervention (seed recycling and sharing).",2016
Food Chain Restoration for Pollinators: Regional Habitat Recovery Strategies Involving Protected Areas of the Southwest,climate change; food web restoration; phenological mismatch; pollinators,FLOWERING TIMES; CLIMATE; CONSERVATION; PHENOLOGY; MUTUALISMS; COMMUNITY; NETWORKS; DECLINES; DRIVERS; SHIFTS,"The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral resources along ""nectar corridors"" accessible to pollinators involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago, leaving ""phenological gaps"" in nectar resource availability for certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have termed ""food web collapse,"" a range of groups have initiated ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a) assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b) hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts, catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We recommend ""bottom-up food chain restoration"" strategies for restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.",2016

Questions: We studied the flowering phenology of a population of the dioecious epiphytic bromeliad, Catopsis compacta, in an oak forest in Oaxaca, Mexico, to answer the following questions: 1) what type of flowering period is exhibited by this population of C. compacta? 2) what is the degree of synchrony between the male and female flowering periods? and 3) what is the flowering synchrony index of the population? Methods: In February 2006, in a 20 m x 20 m plot, we marked and measured 151 individuals of C. compacta >= 10 cm in height (minimum reproductive size). We recorded the number of flowers and fruits present in each individual every month for one year. Results: Our results showed that the flowering period in both sexes lasted for three months (May July). Only 23 marked individuals flowered (15.23 %): of these 12 (52.17 %) were female and 11 (47.83 %) were male. The index of synchrony between females and males was 0.958 +/- 0.013 and the flowering synchrony index of the population was 0.833 +/- 0.189. Conclusions: The high flowering synchrony between the sexes, together with a flowering season that coincided with the period of highest rainfall when the number of arthropods (potential pollinators) is the highest, could favor breeding and, therefore, reproductive success.",2016
Genetic variation in the reduction of attractive floral traits of an annual tarweed in response to drought and apical damage,flower; genetic variation; herbivory; phenotypic plasticity; water availability,PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; MADIA-SATIVA; WILD RADISH; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; WATER AVAILABILITY; PERIANTH REMOVAL; RAPHANUS-SATIVUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE,"Foliar herbivory and water stress may affect floral traits attractive to pollinators. Plant genotypes may differ in their responses to the interplay between these factors, and evolution of phenotypic plasticity could be expected, particularly in heterogeneous environments. We aimed at evaluating the effects of simulated herbivory and experimental drought on floral traits attractive to pollinators in genetic families of the annual tarweed Madia sativa, which inhabits heterogeneous environments in terms of water availability, herbivore abundance and pollinator abundance. In a greenhouse experiment with 15 inbred lines from a M. sativa population located in central Chile (Mediterranean-type climate), we measured the effects of apical bud damage and reduced water availability on: number of ray florets per flower head, length of ray florets, flower head diameter, number of open flower heads per plant, flowering plant height and flowering time. Apical damage and water shortage reduced phenotypic expression of floral traits attractive to pollinators via additive and non-additive effects. Plants in low water showed decreased height and had fewer and shorter ray florets, and fewer and smaller flower heads. Damaged plants showed delayed flowering, were less tall, and showed shorter ray florets and smaller flower heads. The number of ray florets was reduced by damage only in the low water treatment. Plant height, flowering time and number of flower heads showed among-family variation. These traits also showed genetic variation for plasticity to water availability. Ray floret length, flower head size and time to flowering showed genetic variation for plastic responses to apical damage. Plasticity in flowering time may allow M. sativa to adjust to the increased aridity foreseen for its habitat. Because genetic variation for plastic responses was detected, conditions are given for evolutionary responses to selective forces acting on plastic traits. We suggest that the evolution of adaptive floral plasticity in M. sativa in this ecological scenario (heterogeneous environments) would result from selective forces that include not only pollinators but also resource availability and herbivore damage.",2016
Cantharidin world on islands: Species diversity of canthariphilous arthropods in the Izu-Ogasawara Arc,Anthicidae; Ceratopogonidae; chemical attractant; defense chemical; island biogeography; Izu Islands; Ogasawara Islands,NEOPYROCHROA FLABELLATA CANTHARIDIN; CHEMICAL BASIS; POLLINATION; CERATOPOGONIDAE; DIPTERA; COURTSHIP; INSECTS; ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY; PLANT,"Cantharidin is a defense chemical produced by only two beetle families, Meloidae and Oedemeridae. This compound also functions as an attractant for certain groups of arthropods (canthariphilous arthropods). Cantharidin-producing beetles and canthariphilous arthropods build a cantharidin-mediated community, called cantharidin world. In this study, to clarify the canthariphilous arthropod community formed on small islands, the arthropods were collected by cantharidin-baited traps and compared among the mainland, peninsula and 11 small islands of the Izu-Ogasawara Arc, Japan. Control traps without cantharidin were also used to collect non-canthariphilous arthropods. Cantharidin-producing beetles were distributed across the study area, but the number of species was reduced on islands. We identified 10 species of five families as canthariphilous arthropods in this study area: two species of Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae (Coleoptera), four species of Ceratopogonidae (Diptera), three species of Formicidae (Hymenoptera) and one species of Podoctidae (Opiliones). The number of canthariphilous species was not correlated with island size (area) but was negatively correlated with the distance of island from the mainland. These tendencies were also seen in non-canthariphilous fauna. The canthariphilous arthropods increased with the number of cantharidin-producing beetle species, but the non-canthariphilous fauna did not. Thus, the cantharidin world on islands seems to be affected not only by the geographic characteristics of islands, particularly the degree of isolation from the mainland, but also by the diversity of cantharidin-producing members within it.",2016
Integrative taxonomy of the fly orchid group: insights from chemical ecology,Orchidaceae; Ophrys; Integrative taxonomy; Pollination; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS; POLLINATION; SPECIATION; OPHRYS,"Several authors have recently stressed the need to develop an integrative approach in taxonomy, but studies applying such an approach to Mediterranean orchids are scarce. In sexually deceptive orchids from the taxonomically difficult genus Ophrys, pollination is specific and performed by male insects attracted to the flowers by sex pheromone-mimicking floral scents. Floral compounds are therefore of primary importance for reproductive isolation and species delimitations in this genus. In the fly orchid group, molecular, morphological, and ecological characters have been extensively studied, but a comprehensive survey of floral scents is still lacking. In the present study, the blends of floral compounds of its three members, Ophrys insectifera, Ophrys aymoninii, and Ophrys subinsectifera, were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 107 compounds were found, with a majority of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Significant differentiation, both qualitative and quantitative, was found among the three taxa. This result, pooled with those from the literature, forms a comprehensive and congruent dataset that allows us to elucidate the taxonomic rank of the three members of the fly orchid group.",2016
Effect of Synthetic Auxin Herbicides on Seed Development and Viability in Genetically Engineered Glyphosate-Resistant Alfalfa,Adventitious presence; feral; gene flow; genetically engineered; glyphosate resistant; synthetic auxin herbicides,"MEDICAGO-SATIVA L.; NO-TILLAGE CORN; GENE FLOW; MANAGEMENT; FECUNDITY; ECOLOGY; PROGENY; TRAITS; GROWTH; 2,4-D","Feral populations of cultivated crops have the potential to function as bridges and reservoirs that contribute to the unwanted movement of novel genetically engineered (GE) traits. Recognizing that feral alfalfa has the potential to lower genetic purity in alfalfa seed production fields when it is growing in the vicinity of foraging pollinators in alfalfa seed fields, industry has established production standards to control feral plants. However, with the commercialization of GE glyphosate-resistant (GR) alfalfa and the need to support the coexistence of both GE and conventional production, effective methods to control transgenic feral alfalfa need to be developed. Therefore, a study was conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2014 to determine the effect of several synthetic auxin herbicides on seed development in GR alfalfa. GR alfalfa, var. Genuity (R44BD16), was treated with dicamba, 2,4-D, triclopyr, and aminopyralid when alfalfa plants contained green seed pods. Two weeks after herbicide application, plants were harvested, air dried, and seed yield, seed germination, and seedling emergence from the soil were determined. In 2013, dicamba, triclopyr, and 2,4-D decreased alfalfa seed yield per plant compared wih nontreated plants, whereas in 2014, all four herbicides decreased alfalfa seed yield per plant 24 to 49% (by weight) compared with nontreated plants. The same trend was evident in 2012, but seed yield was variable and was not significantly different among treatments. Seed germination averaged 43, 50, and 72% in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, and was not affected by the four herbicides applied at early pod-fill stage. However, seeds harvested from plants treated with dicamba, 2,4-D, and triclopyr often produced deformed and abnormal seedlings, and when planted in soil, frequently failed to emerge. The combined effects of dicamba, 2,4-D, and triclopyr in reducing seed yield, seedling emergence, and seedling growth could contribute to managing feral alfalfa populations.",2016
Diet and Pollinator Role of the Long-Snouted Bat Platalina genovensium in Lomas Ecosystem of Peru,ecology; Haageocereus; Lachay; nectar-bat; pollination,NORTHERN CHILE; 1928 CHIROPTERA; COLUMNAR CACTI; PHYLLOSTOMIDAE; FORESTS; THOMAS; VALLEY; DESERT,"The long-snouted bat (Platalina genovensium) is an endemic nectar-feeding bat from arid regions in western Peru and Chile. In certain areas of its distribution, it is likely the only bat pollinator and seed disperser of plants, and it is currently highly endangered. However, some aspects of its ecology, diet, and pollinator role remain unknown, especially in the unique and endangered lomas ecosystem. We conducted monthly evaluations of bats and plants over 15 months in the lomas of the National Reserve of Lachay (Peru) by sampling in three different plant communities along the Guayabito gorge. We collected fecal and pollen fur samples from 16 individuals of P. genovensium and recorded the phenology of its potential plant food resources. We differentiated fecal sample components and then identified and counted all pollen morphotypes in order to estimate their frequency and abundance in the samples. We also analyzed the niche breadth. Our results showed that the dietary components of P. genovensium included nectar, pollen, fruits, and insects, and that it utilized the cacti community for feeding. Pollen of the genus Haageocereus (Cactaceae) was the most frequent and abundant resource recorded, which was available all year long; moreover, the niche breadth analysis revealed that P. genovensium has a specialized diet on the Haageocereus cactus in Lachay. Finally, we suggest that P. genovensium could serve as a pollinator for Haageocereus acranthus, Haageocereus pseudomelanostele, and Puya ferruginea (Bromeliaceae) due to the large pollen loads it carries and the specific placement of pollen on different body zones.",2016

Small populations may therefore experience greater rates of selfing/intramorph crosses leading to skewed morph ratios and reduced seed production. For the distylous species Houstonia longifolia Gaertn. (""imperiled"" at its northwestern range limit in Alberta), we examined whether small populations were morph-biased and whether seed production was affected by population size, local density, plant size, morph type, and surrounding morph ratio. For focal plants in several populations, we measured size (height, number of stems) and local density (1 m(2)) of pins and thrums, with the focal plants collected for seed counts. Population size was estimated from densities in systematically located quadrats in each population. Morph ratios were pin-biased in small populations but were even to slightly thrum-biased in large populations. The critical population size for maintaining an equal morph ratio was similar to 726 plants. Seed production was most influenced by the interaction between morph type and surrounding morph ratio, which were themselves influenced by population size (Allee effect). Seed production increased for thrums but decreased for pins as the proportion of surrounding pins increased, suggesting strong incompatibility. These results provide guidance on population size and morph ratios for conservation actions.",2016

Nevertheless, polyploids often also exhibit ecological divergence that could contribute to reproductive isolation from diploid ancestors. In this study, we disentangled the contribution of different forms of reproductive isolation between sympatric diploid and autotetraploid individuals of the food-deceptive orchid Anacamptis pyramidalis by quantifying the strength of seven reproductive barriers: three prepollination, one post-pollination prezygotic and three post-zygotic. The overall reproductive isolation between the two cytotypes was found very high, with a preponderant contribution of two prepollination barriers, that is phenological and microhabitat differences. Although the contribution of post-zygotic isolation (triploid sterility) is confirmed in our study, these results highlight that prepollination isolation, not necessarily involving pollinator preference, can represent a strong component of reproductive isolation between different cytotypes. Thus, in the context of polyploidy as quantum speciation, that generates reproductive isolation via triploid sterility, ecological divergence can strengthen the reproductive isolation between cytotypes, reducing the waste of gametes in low fitness interploidy crosses and thus favouring the initial establishment of the polyploid lineage. Under this light, speciation by polyploidy involves ecological processes and should not be strictly considered as a nonecological form of speciation.",2016

Schott as a community and evaluate the community's development. The results showed that C. sclerophylla had strong root turion capacity, of which type Re2 was the most frequent, accounting for 32.4 and 82.4 % of the seedlings under the stock plant were from within-community mating; the 6 pairs of SSR primers chosen yielded high resolution with 97.6 % polymorphic sites; the within-community genetic diversity was over 88.9 % with stock plants (0.49) > seedling plants (0.45). Apparently, C. scerophyllan on Laoshan Island, propagating mainly by root turions, has developed high genetic diversity within a short period, keeping the community in a stage of stable growth and moving toward a climax community. The tillers, however, aggravate closing of the community so that it receives less pollen from outside. Within-community mating is thus reaching seriously high levels, which can lead to lower within-community genetic variation, a decline in DNA genetic diversity, and is bad for its development. Therefore, human interference should be taken to expand genetic exchange among communities.",2016

We needed a quick, cost-efficient and effective way to determine how best to decrease vehicle-caused mortality while maintaining habitat connectivity for the federally listed Oregon silverspot butterfly, Speyeria zerene hippolyta. Therefore, we gathered targeted ecological information that informed selection of a mitigation option prior to implementation. We sampled butterfly behavior and environmental conditions along a highway and conducted a small-scale experiment along a decommissioned road corridor used by these butterflies. Using our findings, we recommended vegetation management and helped managers eliminate options they were considering that would be ineffective such as increasing shade or wind in the road, and installing fencing or hedgerows aimed at directing flight above traffic. This quick and inexpensive approach of using ecological observations and small-scale experiments to evaluate the likely success of each available mitigation option can be used to determine effective, species-specific solutions for reducing traffic impacts on pollinators and other small, flying organisms of conservation concern.",2016

Silene latifolia, a dioecious, short-lived, flowering perennial, grows in both of these climates in Europe. Question: Is variation in traits seen among populations with divergent climates a result of genetic changes in response to local environmental conditions, differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism, or phenotypic plasticity? Hypothesis: Traits will differ between populations in a common garden as a result of genetic divergence, and exhibit a pattern of variation that is congruent with adaptation to climate. Methods: Morphological and phenological measurements were taken during two flowering seasons on plants growing in Croatia (relatively wet and cool) and Spain (hot and dry). Seeds from both regions were grown to flowering in the greenhouse and several traits were measured. Results: Significant divergence in traits existed between Croatia and Spain that persisted in the common garden (greenhouse), indicating that populations in these two regions likely represent different ecotypes. Plants from Spain flowered earlier in the field, made thicker leaves, and produced fewer flowers than plants from Croatia. Plants from Spain also showed greater sexual dimorphism than those from Croatia.",2016
"Honey bees: the queens of mass media, despite minority rule among insect pollinators",Australia; ecosystem services; pollination; science communication,CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION; NEWS; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPES; AUSTRALIA,"1. Pollination is a critical ecosystem function with high ecological and economic value. Conservation initiatives aimed at protecting diverse pollinator communities in natural and agricultural habitats are essential, but the implementation and success of such initiatives often depends on public support. 2. Mass media play an important role in building public awareness around environmental issues, and biased coverage can have damaging effects. Here, we present the first analysis of how Australian mainstream media present the 'pollinator' paradigm. We gathered insect pollinator and pollination related articles from major Australian online newspapers published over a period of 9 years, and performed a qualitative content analysis using deductive coding to record information on the pollinator species or groups discussed in the story. 3. We found 151 stories, and demonstrate that within these, there was a disproportionate focus on introduced European honey bees as the most important, or only, pollinator insect relevant to Australia. Only 15% of stories mentioned native bees as pollinators and 17% mentioned non-bee pollinators. 4. There is potential that the trend we report here for pollinators may be indicative of a larger overall simplification and neglect of biodiversity concepts in mainstream media, both in Australia and globally. As public awareness of science and environmental issues partly depend on disseminating accurate information beyond the scholar network, it is imperative that the broader effects of inaccurate science communication are fully understood.",2016

Biotic interactions, environmental filtering and neutral processes are among the main mechanisms evoked to explain species co-occurrence. However, they are most often studied separately or even considered as mutually exclusive. This likely hampers a more global understanding of species assembly. Here, we investigate the general hypothesis that the structure of co-occurrence networks results from multiple assembly rules and its potential implications for grassland ecosystems. We surveyed orthopteran and plant communities in 48 permanent grasslands of the French Jura Mountains and gathered functional and phylogenetic data for all species. We constructed a network of plant and orthopteran species co-occurrences and verified whether its structure was modular or nested. We investigated the role of all species in the structure of the network (modularity and nestedness). We also investigated the assembly rules driving the structure of the plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network by using null models on species functional traits, phylogenetic relatedness and environmental conditions. We finally compared our results to abundance-based approaches. We found that the plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network had a modular organization. Community assembly rules differed among modules for plants while interactions with plants best explained the distribution of orthopterans into modules. Few species had a disproportionately high positive contribution to this modular organization and are likely to have a key importance to modulate future changes. The impact of agricultural practices was restricted to some modules (3 out of 5) suggesting that shifts in agricultural practices might not impact the entire plant-orthopteran co-occurrence network. These findings support our hypothesis that multiple assembly rules drive the modular structure of the plant-orthopteran network. This modular structure is likely to play a key role in the response of grassland ecosystems to future changes by limiting the impact of changes in agricultural practices such as intensification to some modules leaving species from other modules poorly impacted. The next step is to understand the importance of this modular structure for the long-term maintenance of grassland ecosystem structure and functions as well as to develop tools to integrate network structure into models to improve their capacity to predict future changes.",2016

Further, it has been hypothesized that the presence of heterospecific pollen on flower stigmas adversely affects plant reproduction with increasing effect in closely related species. Using two pairs of co-occurring buzz-pollinated Thysanotus spp. in the Mediterranean climate region of Perth, Western Australia, we quantified the effect of heterospecific pollen on fruit and seed set. We first determined the mating systems of the two focal species using self- and outcross pollen, followed by separate treatments with heterospecific pollen within each species pair. Of the two species receiving pollen, Thysanotus triandrus had a mixed mating system, but with significantly lower fruit and seed set from self-pollen relative to outcross pollen. Thysanotus tenellus was autogamous with no difference in fruit or seed set between autogamous, self- or outcross pollinations. Heterospecific pollen had no effect on fruit or seed set of either focal species. These outcomes point to post-pollination reproductive isolation, consistent with a floral morphology that causes low specificity of pollen placement and thus a poor capacity for pre-pollination discrimination. Negative effects of heterospecific pollen, therefore, do not appear to play a role in the reproduction in this group of buzz-pollinated flowers.",2016

The settling velocities of moss spores were measured and it was determined whether settling velocities can be derived from spore diameter using Stokes' Law or if specific traits of spore ornamentation cause departures from theoretical expectations. Methods A fall tower design combined with a high-speed camera was used to document spore settling velocities in nine moss species selected to cover the range of spore diameters within the group. Linear mixed effect models were employed to determine whether settling velocity can be predicted from spore diameter, taking specific variation in shape and surface roughness into account. Key Results Average settling velocity of moss spores ranged from 0 center dot 49 to 8 center dot 52 cm s(-1). There was a significant positive relationship between spore settling velocity and size, but the inclusion of variables of shape and texture of spores in the best-fit models provides evidence for their role in shaping spore settling velocities. Conclusions Settling velocities in mosses can significantly depart from expectations derived from Stokes' Law. We suggest that variation in spore shape and ornamentation affects the balance between density and drag, and results in different dispersal capacities, which may be correlated with different life-history traits or ecological requirements. Further studies on spore ultrastructure would be necessary to determine the role of complex spore ornamentation patterns in the drag-to-mass ratio and ultimately identify what is the still poorly understood function of the striking and highly variable ornamentation patterns of the perine layer on moss spores.",2016

The results showed that osteoderm-based skeletochronology was unreliable, since within any specimen examined the number of lines of arrested growth (LAG) varied among and even within osteoderms. On the contrary, skeletochronology was to some degree applicable to the neural arch of the caudal vertebrae, as the LAG number was roughly stable in all neural arches per animal studied. Assuming that one LAG is formed per year, the oldest individual in the present study was nine years old. However, age underestimation due to bone remodeling that completely destroyed the LAGs cannot be ruled out. Therefore, cautious interpretation is required in the skeletochronological age estimation of Anguis if caudal vertebrae are analyzed.",2016

Yet, past research has largely failed to examine multiple interactions that can have opposing impacts on agricultural production in a given context. We collected data on arthropod communities and yield quality and quantity parameters (fruit set, yield loss and net outcomes) in three major apple-growing regions in south-eastern Australia. We quantified the net yield outcome (accounting for positive and negative interactions) of multiple animal activities (pollination, fruit damage, biological control) across the entire growing season on netted branches, which excluded vertebrate predators of arthropods, and open branches. Net outcome was calculated as the number of undamaged fruit at harvest as a proportion of the number of blossoms (i.e., potential fruit yield). Vertebrate exclusion resulted in lower levels of fruit set and higher levels of arthropod damage to apples, but did not affect net outcomes. Yield quality and quantity parameters (fruit set, yield loss, net outcomes) were not directly associated with arthropod functional groups. Model variance and significant differences between the ratio of pest to beneficial arthropods between regions indicated that complex relationships between environmental factors and multiple animal interactions have a combined effect on yield. Our results show that focusing on a single crop stage, species group or ecosystem function/service can overlook important complexity in ecological processes within the system. Accounting for this complexity and quantifying the net outcome of ecological interactions within the system, is more informative for research and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.",2016

In order to broaden the genetic resource of Larix kaempferi, an effort was made in 1996 to introduce 128 families from seven seed orchards in Japan, with which to establish two progeny trials in climatically different environments. The experiment was aimed to determine the strategy of early selection, particularly important for long-rotated Japanese larch, and the optimal breeding program for specific environments. Result: Growth trajectories revealed different growth performances of stem height (HGT) and diameter at breast height (DBH) in two different environments, Hubei and Liaoning. In both sites, there were marked variabilities in HGT, DBH and volume (VOL) among families at each year. The trends of individual and family heritability and age-age correlations were found to follow a certain dynamic pattern. Based on these trends, the optimum selection age was determined at four years for HGT and five years for DBH in Hubei and Liaoning. Genetic gains for VOL were 34.4 and 6.04 % in Hubei and Liaoning respectively when selection ratio was 10 % at age 16. Type-B correlations were less than 0.67 and rank correlations of breeding value were less than 0.4 for HGT, DBH and VOL between the two sites, revealing that there exist pronounced family-by-site interactions for the growth traits of Larix kaempferi. Conclusions: Early selection for Larix kaempferi is an effective strategy to overcome its long rotation age. In early selection, dual growth trait selection is more effective than single one. Regionalization deployment should be considered in Larix. kaempferi breeding program based on different environmental factors.",2016
Orchid conservation: further links,Conservation biology; fungi; mycorrhizas; Orchidaceae; orchids; pollination ecology; taxonomy,POLLINATION; PLANTS; FUNGI,"Background: Due in great part to their often complex interactions with mycorrhizal fungi, pollinators and host trees, Orchidaceae present particular challenges for conservation. Furthermore, orchids, as potentially the largest family of angiosperms with > 26000 species, species complexes and frequent hybrid formation, are complex to catalogue. Following a highlight in 2015, a further seven papers focusing on orchids, their interactions with beneficial organisms, pollinators and mycorrhiza, and other factors relating to their conservation, including threats from human utilization and changing land use, are presented here. Conclusions: The production of an online flora of all known plants and an assessment of the conservation status of all known plant species as far as possible, to guide conservation action are the first two targets of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation. Without knowing how many species there are and how they should be circumscribed, neither of these targets is achievable. Orchids are a fascinating subject for fundamental research with rapid species evolution, specific organ structure and development, but they also suffer from high levels of threat. Effective orchid conservation must take account of the beneficial interactions with fungi and pollinators and the potentially detrimental effects of over-collection and changes in land use.",2016

The nonnative succulent plant Kalanchoe pinnata, reported as invasive in some countries, is widespread in remnants of seasonally dry tropical forest on a volcanic outcrop with high conservation value in east-central Mexico where we assessed its mating system and demographic growth and identified management strategies. To understand its local mating system, we conducted hand-pollination treatments, germination, and survival experiments. Based on the experimental data, we constructed a life-stage population matrix, identified the key traits for population growth, weighted the contributions of vegetative and sexual reproduction, and evaluated management scenarios. Hand-pollination treatments had slight effects on fruit and seed setting, as well as on germination. With natural pollination treatment, the successful germination of seeds from only 2/39 fruit suggests occasional effective natural cross-pollination. The ratios of the metrics for self-and cross-pollinated flowers suggest that K. pinnata is partially self-compatible. Most of the pollinated flowers developed into fruit, but the seed germination and seedling survival rates were low. Thus, vegetative propagation and juvenile survival are the main drivers of population growth. Simulations of a virtual K. pinnata population suggest that an intense and sustained weeding campaign will reduce the population within at least 10 years. Synthesis and applications. The study population is partially self-compatible, but sexual reproduction by K. pinnata is limited at the study site, and population growth is supported by vegetative propagation and juvenile survival. Demographic modeling provides key insights and realistic forecasts on invasion process and therefore is useful to design management strategies.",2016
Development of Multiple Polymorphic Microsatellite Markers for Ceratina calcarata (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Using Genome-Wide Analysis,Ceratina calcarata; microsatellite marker; Illumina,EASTERN NORTH-AMERICA; SMALL CARPENTER BEE; EUSOCIAL SWEAT BEE; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; BUMBLE BEES; LOCI; BIOLOGY; ORGANIZATION; POLLINATORS; POPULATIONS,"The small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata (Robertson), is a widespread native pollinator across eastern North America. The behavioral ecology and nesting biology of C. calcarata has been relatively well-studied and the species is emerging as a model organism for both native pollinator and social evolution research. C. calcarata is subsocial: reproductively mature females provide extended maternal care to their brood. As such, studies of C. calcarata may also reveal patterns of relatedness and demography unique to primitively social Hymenoptera. Here, we present 21 microsatellite loci, isolated from the recently completed C. calcarata genome. Screening in 39 individuals across their distribution revealed that no loci were in linkage disequilibrium, nor did any deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg following sequential Bonferroni correction. Allele count ranged from 2 to 14, and observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.08 to 0.82 (mean 0.47) and 0.26 to 0.88 (mean 0.56), respectively. These markers will enable studies of population-wide genetic structuring across C. calcarata's distribution. Such tools will also allow for exploration of between and within-colony relatedness in this subsocial native pollinator.",2016

As ecological succession can represent community assembly in action, understanding how successional time affects the functional and phylogenetic structure of communities can reveal the influence of different factors on the assembly process. We analysed functional patterns of multiple traits related to the succession of tropical forests to answer if there are trait convergence and/or divergence with regeneration age, and if functional and phylogenetic diversity can be predicted by forest age. We compiled checklists from studies of 23 successional forests in Brazilian Atlantic Forest, ranging from 4 to 120 years old. We also compiled functional traits for a total of 355 species. We analysed the data by a method that includes scaling-up trait-based data to the community level and matrix correlations of multiple traits. We built linear models to show the relationship between each trait and diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) with successional time. We found no phylogenetic signal at the species pool and metacommunity levels, but significant trait divergence (tree guild, leaf slenderness, leaf area, pollination entomo-philous generalist and pollination by vertebrate) and trait convergence (arboreal habitus, tree guild, leaf compoundness, pollination entomophilous generalist) patterns related to the successional gradient. Also, functional diversity increased during succession, with a significant increase in leaf slenderness and zoochoric dispersal and decrease in tree guild. Phylogenetic diversity also increased along the successional gradient. We found that the communities in the studied successional gradient are structured by both environmental (measured by trait convergence) and biotic (measured by trait divergence) filtering. The species turnover and diversification at taxonomic level are followed by well-defined patterns of trait turnover, revealing that community assembly is constrained by environmental filters at the beginning and by limiting similarity at the advanced stages of the succession.",2016

(an endemic Himalayan medicinal herb) collected from 11 different populations of West Himalaya using ISSR markers. Of the total 130 ISSR primers screened, only ten ISSR primers generated 94 clear and reproducible banding patterns, of which 89 bands (94.68 %) were polymorphic. Based on the percentage of polymorphic loci (94.68 %), Nei's gene diversity (0.198) and Shannon's information index (0.329), high genetic diversity was detected at the species level. Genetic differentiation (G(ST) = 0.202) was also recorded as moderate level due to high gene flow (Nm = 1.976) among populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variation (90 %) resided within the populations (Phi(ST) = 0.10). STRUCTURE analysis revealed two ancestral groups of the species, which were further supported by neighbour-joining cluster analysis. Among the different ecological habitats, high genetic diversity in populations under open grassy land showed suitability and preferred habitat conditions. High genetic diversity within population suggests in situ and ex situ conservation of selected populations for conserving and maintaining wide genetic pool of the species.",2016

The majority of species interact with few partner species, while a small number are highly connected to form network hubs that are proposed to play an important role in community stability. It has not been investigated, however, if or how the degree distributions vary among types of mutualisms or communities, or between plants and animals in the same network. Here, we evaluate the degree distributions of pollination and seed-dispersal networks, which are two major types of mutualistic networks that have often been discussed in parallel, using an index based on Pielou's evenness. Among 56 pollination networks we found strong negative correlation of the heterogeneity between plants and animals, and geographical shifts of network hubs from plants in temperate regions to animals in the tropics. For 28 seed-dispersal networks, by contrast, the correlation was positive, and there is no comparable geographical pattern. These results may be explained by evolution towards specialization in the presence of context-dependent costs that occur if plants share the animal species as interaction partner. How the identity of network hubs affects the stability and resilience of the community is an important question for future studies.",2016
Absence of postmating barriers between a selfing vs. outcrossing Chilean Mimulus species pair,allopatric hybridization; evolution of self-fertilization; floral anthocyanins; hybrid fitness; mating system; Phrymaceae; pre-mating barriers; stress tolerance; sympatric hybridization,REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; FLOWER COLOR; MATING SYSTEM; MODEL SYSTEM; PATTERNS; PLANTS; EVOLUTION; DIVERGENCE; PHRYMACEAE,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Reproductive isolation between sympatric species pairs may be maintained by both pre- and postmating barriers. Here we evaluate potential barriers to mating between the outcrossing Mimulus luteus and its more highly selfing sympatric congener, M. cupreus, two members of the South American luteus complex of Mimulus. METHODS: Seed set was compared following autonomous self-pollination, manual pollination, conspecific outcrossing, and sympatric and allopatric hybridization, for laboratory-maintained inbred lines and wild-collected accessions. Survival and reproductive fitness of hybrids relative to parental species were examined across environments that differed with respect to temperature and soil nutrients, two factors that vary across the ranges of M. luteus and M. cupreus. KEY RESULTS: Mimulus luteus was minimally capable of autonomous self-fertilization, consistent with reliance on an animal pollinator, whereas M. cupreus was a successful selfer across all tested accessions. Postmating barriers to hybridization are negligible, in both low-and high-stress environments, across multiple sympatric and allopatric populations. CONCLUSION: As in the North American M. guttatus-M.nasutus species pair, postmating barriers contribute little to isolation between M. luteus and M. cupreus. This result reinforces the importance of premating barriers, specifically species differences in reliance on, and accessibility to, animal pollinators. A unique aspect of the M. luteus-M. cupreus pair is the recent gain of red floral anthocyanin pigmentation in M. cupreus. On the basis of species differences in vegetative anthocyanin production, a facultative stress-protective response, we propose a potential stress-protective role for the constitutive floral anthocyanins of M. cupreus.",2016

All plant parts are of medicinal importance whereas the fruit known as magic berry, miracle berry, or sweet berry is consumed fresh. Surprisingly, very little is known on the species in terms of flower morphology and flower development. In this study, an observation on the flower morphology and flower development of miracle fruit has been made with the aid of microscopic techniques. Miracle fruit flower requires 100 days to develop from reproductive meristem to full anthesis. The flower development can be divided into six stages based on the size and appearance of the flower bud. The fruit with persistent style developed and ripened 90 days after anthesis. Heavy fruit drop was observed at 40-60 days after anthesis which contributed to the final fruit set of average of 5.06% per plant. Through this study, miracle fruit is strongly insect pollinated and prevents self-fertilization. A study on pollination ecology is needed to identify the pollinator for miracle fruit, as this is important in manipulating fruit loading in the future.",2016
Development of ten microsatellite markers from the keystone mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae) using 454 next generation sequencing and their applicability to population genetic structure studies,Genetic diversity; Genetic marker; Microsatellites; Tristerix corymbosus,SEED DISPERSAL; POLLINATION; PLANT,"Tristerix corymbosus (Loranthaceae) is a keystone mistletoe from the South American temperate rainforests. As most mistletoes, T. corymbosus relies on biotic pollination and seed dispersal, which may cause population structure. For a better understanding of its ecology, we isolated and characterized ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for this species. We used 454 Next Generation Sequencing to build a microsatellite library from a high quality DNA sample. We tested 90 sequences from which we obtained ten polymorphic markers. In order to assess their variability, the novel markers were tested in 48 individuals from three locations of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve in Chile. We also estimated genetic differences between pairs of populations using the F-ST statistic. The mean number of alleles per locus in the 48 individuals studied was 7.1 (2-17 alleles per locus). The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.298 to 0.634 and from 0.310 to 0.881, respectively. There were genetic differences among the three populations assessed, according to the F-ST values (ranging from 0.048 to 0.100, all significant) and, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 3.9 to 5.1. These are the first microsatellite markers developed for T. corymbosus, and they arise as a powerful tool for studying population structure, genetic diversity and gene flow at the landscape scale, along its distribution.",2016

Here, we examine the contribution of two key traits-assortative mating and self-fertilization-to reinforcement and (by extension) cascade speciation. First, using a population genetic model of reinforcement we find that both assortative mating and self-fertilization can make independent contributions to increased reproductive isolation, consistent with reinforcement. Self-fertilization primarily evolves due to its 2-fold transmission advantage when inbreeding depression (d) is lower (d<0.45) but evolves as a function of the cost of hybridization under higher inbreeding depression (0.45<d<0.48). When both traits can evolve simultaneously, increased self-fertilization often prohibits the evolution of assortative mating. We infer that, under specific conditions, mating system transitions are more likely to lead to increased reproductive isolation and initiate cascade speciation, than assortative mating. Based on the results of our simulations, we hypothesized that transitions to self-fertilization could contribute to clade-wide diversification if reinforcement or cascade speciation is common. We tested this hypothesis with comparative data from two different groups. Consistent with our hypothesis, there was a trend towards uniparental reproduction being associated with increased diversification rate in the Nematode phylum. For the plant genus Mimulus, however, self-fertilization was associated with reduced diversification. Reinforcement driving speciation via transitions to self-fertilization might be short lived or unsustainable across macroevolutionary scales in some systems (some plants), but not others (such as nematodes), potentially due to differences in susceptibility to inbreeding depression and/or the ability to transition between reproductive modes.",2016

Automated modified Pennsylvania light traps were used to sample macro-moth assemblages for three consecutive nights at each of 24 sites ranging from 200m asl to 1200m asl within continuous tropical rainforest at Eungella, Queensland, Australia (21 degrees S, 148 degrees E). A total of 13861 individual moths representing approximately 713 morphospecies and 10045 individuals belonging to approximately 607 morphospecies where sampled during November 2013 and March 2014 respectively. Moth assemblages exhibited a strong elevational signal during both sampling seasons; we grouped these into lowland and upland assemblages. The dispersal pattern of moth assemblages across the landscape reflected the stratification of vegetation communities across elevation and correlated with shifts in eco-physical variables, most notably temperature and substrate organic matter. Regional historical biogeographical events likely contributed to the observed patterns. The analysis presented here identifies a set of statistically defined elevationally restricted moths which may be of use as part of a multi-taxon predictor set for monitoring future ecosystem level changes associated with elevation and, by implication, with climate.",2016

Understanding the biology and ecology of bees in poorly studied regions is the first step towards conservation. Detailed surveys in New Hampshire reveal a broad diversity of 118 species of wild bees in different guilds and habitats including 17 bee species representing new state records. Network analyses reveal a complex community structure and relatively poorly connected plant-pollinator associations, thus species may be susceptible to disturbance. Phenological analyses document that at least one representative of five native bee families was present throughout the foraging season and both abundance and diversity were highest in June and July. This study provides important baseline information on bee abundance, diversity, phenology, and host plant associations necessary for future conservation efforts.",2016
Interspecies Interactions of Fig Wasp Species and Their Association with the Fig Tree Ficus schwarzii Koord.,Ficus schwarzii Koord; fig wasp species; host utilisation; interspecies interaction; path diagram,POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY,"The interspecies interactions of fig wasps found in male figs, Ficus schwarzii Koord., including the influences of the fig diameter, the number of florets, and the wall thickness and focusing on the pollinator species were documented. The total number of individuals of the three non-pollinator species (Apocryptophagus sp., Philotrypesis sp., Apocrypta sp.) showed a significant negative correlation with the number of pollinators (Ceratosolen vetustus). The results from a path analysis indicated that Apocyptophagus sp. was an important non-pollinator species that competed for the same niche as the pollinator. The Philotrypesis sp. acted as a parasitoid of the pollinator, whereas Apocrypta sp. was considered to be a generalist for host selection. From the path model, an increase of pollinator numbers generally related to the bigger size of fig and the more plentiful florets that also favoured the pollinators. The wall thickness had a negative effect on the population number of the pollinators.",2016

The importance of the plant pollinator interplay (PPI), in flowering crops such as legumes lies in a combination of the importance of pollination for the production service and breeding strategies, plus the increasing urgency in mitigating the decline of pollinators through the development and implementation of conservation measures. To realize the full potential of the PPI, a multidisciplinary approach is required. This article assembles an international team of genebank managers, geneticists, plant breeders, experts on environmental governance and agro-ecology, and comprises several sections. The contributions in these sections outline both the state of the art of knowledge in the field and the novel aspects under development, and encompass a range of reviews, opinions and perspectives. The first three sections explore the role of PPI in legume breeding strategies. PPI based approaches to crop improvement can make it possible to adapt and re-design breeding strategies to meet both goals of: (1) optimal productivity, based on an efficient use of pollinators, and (2) biodiversity conservation. The next section deals with entomological aspects and focuses on the protection of the ""pest control service"" and pollinators in legume crops. The final section addresses general approaches to encourage the synergy between food production and pollination services at farmer field level.

Here, we combine field observations and a dynamic model to understand how spatial processes may affect a network composed of the flowering plant Antirrhinum majus, its cohort of pollinators, and a specialist seed-predator and its parasitoid. The interactions taking place within this system were investigated by determining the fate of flowers and fruits on flowering and fruiting stems at 16 study sites. We then used this information to estimate spatial and temporal variation in the pollination rate, parasitism rate and hyperparasitism rate. We found that the plants were pollinator-limited, with relatively variable fruit-to-flower ratios across sites. On almost all sites, plants were both parasitized and hyperparasitized, at a low to moderate rate. Comparing our field observations with a tritrophic Nicholson-Bailey model, we found that empirical data are not always consistent with the conditions for local tritrophic persistence. This suggests that other mechanisms such as random disturbances and recolonizations (patch dynamics) or inter-site migration through metacommunity dynamics (source-sink dynamics) play a role in this system. Model simulations showed that dispersal could contribute to increasing tritrophic persistence in this system, and that source-sink structure, not just environmental stochasticity, may cause the observed pattern of spatial variation.Synthesis. We defined and measured metrics related to species interactions and densities. This led us to suggest that the functioning of the A.majus metacommunity is more consistent with source-sink than patch metacommunity dynamics, highlighting the extent to which dispersal explains the persistence of the system.",2016
A fluorescent method for visualization of Nosema infection in whole-mount honey bee tissues,Nosema; Microsporidia; Honey bee; Infection; Cell biology,APIS-MELLIFERA; CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; COLONY COLLAPSE; PATHOGEN; INSIGHTS,"Honey bees are critical pollinators in both agricultural and ecological settings. The Nosema species, ceranae and apis, are microsporidian parasites that are pathogenic to honey bees. While current methods for detecting Nosema infection have key merits, additional techniques with novel properties for studying the cell biology of Nosema infection are highly desirable. We demonstrate that whole-mount staining of honey bee midgut tissue with chitin-binding agent Fluorescent Brightener 28 and DNA dye Propidium Iodide allows for observation of Nosema infection in structurally intact tissue, providing a new tool for increasing our understanding of Nosema infection at the cellular and tissue level.

When the introduced and the native species are congeners, interference in pollination can also lead to hybridization. We aimed to understand the ecological aspects of Euterpe oleracea introduction in the Atlantic forest and the possible consequences for the conservation of the native congener Euterpe edulis. We analysed the population structure of palm populations, including hybrids, and observed the interaction with frugivorous birds of both palm species after E. oleracea introduction. We observed that E. edulis had significantly lower density and a smaller number of seedlings when occurring with E. oleracea. Native and introduced Euterpe species shared nine frugivorous bird species. E. oleracea and hybrids had dispersed outside the original planting area. Consequently, the risks of introduction of E. oleracea may mostly be related to the disruption of interactions between E. edulis and frugivorous birds and the spontaneous production of hybrids. Finally, the cultivation of E. oleracea and hybrids in Atlantic rainforest could affect the conservation of the already endangered E. edulis.",2016

We examined the role of intraspecific interactions, both competitive and facilitative, in structuring populations of Spartina alterniflora, a foundational salt marsh plant known to influence community structure and function throughout its native distribution in eastern North America. We conducted a transplantation experiment at a created site in southwestern Louisiana, USA, by growing five S. alterniflora genotypes, or clones, for two years in all possible combinations, and monitored their interactions using morphological measurements and molecular marker genotyping. Using stem densities as a proxy for above-ground biomass, we found support for our hypothesis that interactions have a mutually limiting effect on growth, although we were unable to find statistical support for competitive asymmetries between specific clone pairs, which would have explained earlier observations of declining genotypic diversity in aging marshes. Using proportions of stems flowering as a proxy for reproductive effort, we also found support for our hypothesis that interactions can have a stimulatory effect on flowering, which could promote genotypic diversity through the recruitment of out crossed seedlings in a species known for severe inbreeding depression. Reproductive interactions were at times mutually inhibitory or stimulatory, as evidenced by positive correlations of flowering responses between clones. To our knowledge, ours is one of the first studies to evaluate the outcome of one-on-one interactions among genotypes of a foundational clonal plant.  ",2016

In this study, trials with colored sticky traps (white, yellow, blue and green) in mandarin cv Okitsu (Satsuma) trees were carried out during 2011 and 2012 in Adana Province, Turkey. Colored plates were hung, at about 1.7 m above ground level, from the exterior canopy of the selected trees and were positioned to the four cardinal directions. A total of 15 beneficial insect species were captured on various colored plates. Yellow and green traps were more attractive to the coccinellid, Oenopia conglobata (L., 1758), than the other colored traps. Significantly more of the predaceous hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer, 1776) and the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., 1758 were obtained on white traps. Green and blue traps were the least attractive to A. mellifera. The yellow, blue and green traps hung on the west side of the trees captured significantly more beneficial insects, but white traps hung on the south sides of outer branches trapped considerable numbers of E. balteatus and 0. conglobata.

"Temperature Rise and Its Influence on the Cessation of Diapause in Plebeia droryana, a Eusocial Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae)",Apidae; beneficial arthropod; climate change; diapause; physiological ecology,CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSECT PHOTOPERIODISM; POLLINATION; INDUCTION; EVOLUTION; MODELS,"Climate warming in the coming decades may affect diapause in insect species which use it to survive unfavorable winter conditions. Plebeia droryana (Friese) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) is a highly eusocial bee species that exhibits reproductive diapause and inhabits southern South America where winter temperatures may fall below 10A degrees C, or even below 0A degrees C in extreme years. In this paper, we evaluate whether P. droryana might terminate diapause during winter under laboratory conditions. We initially kept colonies of P. droryana at 8A degrees C in a biochemical oxygen demand chamber, and then raised the temperature by 2A degrees C every 3 d until the cessation of diapause was detected, as indicated by the onset of brood cell building and subsequent egg-laying by queens. We found that the termination of diapause in P. droryana could be achieved at temperatures between 16A degrees C and 22A degrees C, resulting in typical postdiapause brood cell building and egg-laying rates. Our binomial generalized linear mixed model indicated that only temperature, but no time or temperature-time interaction, explained the probability of termination of diapause in P. droryana. Again, only temperature, but no time or temperature-time interaction, significantly affected amount of brood cell built postdiapause in this species. These data suggest that the levels of predicted climate warming in the geographic range of P. droryana over the coming decades will probably result in these populations abandoning diapause behavior. These results have important implications regarding the ecological service of crop and wild plant pollination provided by this species.",2016

Past studies have focussed on population dynamics and allelopathic effects associated with the species, but little is known about its seed ecology. To address this dearth of information, this study aimed to investigate: (i) the effect of various stress factors (temperature, light, osmotic potential, salt stress, heat-shock, a combination of heat-shock and smoke, pH buffer, and burial depth of seed) on seed germination and seedling emergence, and (ii) factors affecting the fate of seedlings. The results show that N. glauca was able to germinate over a broad range of temperatures with highest seed germination occurring at 30/20 degrees C with 12h of light and 12h of dark conditions. Seed germination was greatest (89%) when seeds were placed on the soil surface and emergence decreased considerably as planting depth increased from 0.5 to 1.5cm. Water stress greatly reduced seed germination (58% germination at osmotic potentials below -0.2MPa) and germination was completely inhibited at water potentials of -0.4 to -0.6MPa. Although increasing salinity reduced the seed germination of this invasive species, N. glauca seed was able to germinate in both alkaline (81% at pH 10) and acidic (80% at pH 4) conditions. The trial on the effect of seed age and field seed burial on seed germination showed a slight decline in seed germination after 120 days of burial compared with non-buried seeds. Further, the combined effect of heat-shock and smoke effectively inhibited the germination of N. glauca seeds; however, our study shows that seedlings of N. glauca can withstand heat-shock of up to 130 degrees C. Studies such as this will assist in the development of control strategies to prevent the spread of this invasive species into arid landscapes.",2016
"Circular distribution of three species of epiphytic orchids in shade coffee plantations, in Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico",Cardinal orientation; Lepanthes acuminata; Oncidium guatemalenoides; Oncidium poikilostalix; phorophyte,IONOPSIS-UTRICULARIOIDES ORCHIDACEAE; ONCIDIUM-POIKILOSTALIX ORCHIDACEAE; SEED DISPERSAL; RECRUITMENT; SPECIFICITY; FOREST; POPULATIONS; POLLINATION; COMMUNITY; CUBA,"Background and aims - Cardinal orientation of individuals is one of the least known and understood ecological or demographic factor governing the dynamics of epiphytic orchid populations. The circular distribution of three epiphytic orchids, Oncidium poikilostalix, Oncidium guatemalenoides and Lepanthes acuminata, was studied in shaded coffee plantations in the region of Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico. A preference for a certain cardinal orientation on the phorophytes was analyzed, using circular statistics. Methods - Circular distribution tendencies were compared between the three species, two life stages (immatures and adults), and between the microsites (trunk, branch forks, branches, twigs) in which the individual orchids were distributed on the phorophytes. Results - Oncidium poikilostalix was the most abundant species (1,056 individuals). The three orchid species were found growing mainly on twigs of the coffee bushes. For populations in general, and for the life stages and microsites in particular, individuals of O. poikilostalix and O. guatemalenoides showed a preference for occupying the combination of the cardinal orientations south-southwest-west. Individuals of L. acuminata were orientated towards all eight cardinal points, with a slight numerical preference for east. Conclusions - Cardinal orientation of orchid species can be driven by specific climatic or ecological factors (e.g. direction and speed of prevailing winds; O. poikilostalix and O. guatemalenoides). These species may show clearer preferences for growing facing certain cardinal orientations. However, many species can be affected by a combination of microclimatic and ecological factors (e.g. humidity in the microenvironments, proximity to water sources, insolation, shade, competition or wind speed and direction; L. acuminata), which may influence at such a limited and local scale that orientation patterns may be difficult to detect.",2016

This species is on the verge of extinction due to over-exploitation and habitat destruction and needs immediate preventive measures. Despite being essential for domestication, there have been few studies of the natural variation, breeding and genetic system of this species possibly due to its remote location and sparse populations. The present study has revealed that N. grandiflora, which is restricted to specific ecological niches in high alpine regions 3000-5000 m asl, is under stress due to its infrequent flowering nature, which limits generation of new variation, although some intra-population variability with regard to lamina margin (dentate and wavy) and type of stigma (capitate and trilobed) were observed. This limited variability prevents the species from colonizing new niches, as it mostly multiplies through rhizome ramets. Several interesting features have also been revealed, e.g. presence of bicolpate, tricolpate, tetracolpate and pentacolpate pollen grains as well as isobilateral, decussate and tetrahedral types of tetrad within the same or in different flowers. This study also establishes a new diploid chromosome number (2n = 78), the plant's genomic allohexaploidy, up to 58% cross pollination; protoandry, its infrequent flowering nature, a high pollen ovule ratio of 6135 +/- 327.86 per flower and poor seed set.",2016

We supposed that each (especially characteristic) chemical in floral scents may play a specific role in mediating pollinator behaviours and tested this supposition in a fig-fig wasp mutualism. Ficus curtipes is obligately pollinated by an undescribed Eupristina species. In the scent of F. curtipes receptive figs, over 50 compounds have been identified, and the scent is dominated by two compounds, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (OL) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (NE). We therefore tested the roles of the two major chemicals in mediating the pollinator behaviours. Our results show that OL and NE, respectively, act as a long-distance attractant and a fig-entry behaviour stimulant to the obligate pollinator wasp. Namely, OL attracts the wasps to the figs and NE guides the wasps into the figs. This finding on the work division of floral scent compounds partially explains the maintenance mechanism of the fig-fig wasp mutualism and the significance of the chemical diversity of floral scent in plant-pollinator interactions, especially in specialised pollination systems.",2016
DEVELOPMENT OF PINUS SYLVESTRIS L. MALE GAMETOPHYTE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENT,pollen; Pinus silvestris L; viability; pollen tube; active peroxidase; urban environment; environmental stress,POLLEN; NO2,"The peculiarities of the development of the male gametophyte of Pinus silvestris L. in the urban environment were studied. Quality of pollen was evaluated by laboratory experiments through germination at the nutrient medium and by histochemical staining to determine the presence of redox enzymes. It was shown that pollen viability is closely linked to climatic and weather conditions during the period of microsporogenesis and mass pollination. Atmospheric pollution affected the pollen significantly. Low temperatures and high humidity in the background of the weak capacity of self-purification of the atmosphere led to a reduction of the potential pollen viability. The ability of the pollen grains to germinate was reduced, the number of abnormal pollen tubes was increased, and the proportion of cells containing active peroxidase was decreased. We revealed a close positive correlation between the frequency of germinated pollen grains and the presence of active peroxidase, as well as a negative correlation between the percentage of colored pollen and the frequency of pollen tube anomalies, which confirmed the role of peroxidase activity not only in the induction of pollen germination, but also the formation of pollen tubes. A ranking of the urban territory on the strength of unfavorable environmental factors has been carried out. The reaction of male gametophyte of pine allowed us to consider it as a biological indicator of unfavorable ecological situation in the urban environment.",2016

Far less work has investigated bioinspired adhesion that is tuned to micro- and nano-scale sizes and forces. However, such adhesive forces are extremely important in the adhesion of micro-and nanoparticles to surfaces, relevant to a wide range of industrial and biological systems. Pollens, whose adhesion is critical to plant reproduction, are an evolutionary-optimized system for biomimicry to engineer tunable adhesion between particles and micro-patterned soft matter surfaces. In addition, the adhesion of pollen particles is relevant to topics as varied as pollinator ecology, transport of allergens, and atmospheric phenomena. We report the first observation of structurally-derived pressure-sensitive adhesion of a microparticle by using the sunflower pollen and stigma surfaces as a model. This strong, pressure-sensitive adhesion results from interlocking between the pollen's conical spines and the stigma's receptive papillae. Inspired by this behavior, we fabricated synthetic polymeric patterned surfaces that mimic the stigma surface's receptivity to pollen. These soft mimics allow the magnitude of the pressure-sensitive response to be tuned by adjusting the size and spacing of surface features. These results provide an important new insight for soft material adhesion based on bio-inspired principles, namely that ornamented microparticles and micro-patterned surfaces can be designed with complementarity that enable a tunable, pressure-sensitive adhesion on the microparticle size and length scale.",2016

In spite of its ecological and economic importance, natural populations of M. mandacaia have been depleted because of deforestation. In order to evaluate the interpopulation morphometric structure of remaining populations, we carried out geometric morphometric studies based on fore wing shape in this native bee species. The grouping analysis by UPGMA revealed three distinct clusters and significant differences in fore wing size were observed (p<0.001) among populations. The three groups were also reflected in the first two principal components explaining about 60% of the total variation. These results indicate differentiation among populations, which can be regarded as unique management units. Therefore, efforts should be directed to the conservation of local populations of M. mandacaia to avoid the negative impacts of loss in pollination over plant species and environmental services.",2016

We compiled data on pollination and dispersal syndromes of 406 plant species distributed among different elevations in Area de Protecao Ambiental da Serra de Baturite (APASB) in northeastern Brazil. We aim to determine how the dispersal and pollination of the flora in the mountainous rainforest of APASB are affected by climate, relief and growth form. We hypothesized that plant community is comprised of different ecological groups based on biotic and abiotic syndromes. Melittophily was the most common (57%) pollination syndrome followed by non-specialized and ornithophily (7%). We found that 64% of species exhibited zoochory, 19% exhibited anemochory and 17% exhibited autochory. Pollination syndromes differed significantly only between types of growth form. Dispersal syndromes differed between topology, growth form and elevation. Six ecological groups were formed based on the interaction between dispersal-pollination and growth form, with predominantly zoochory in woody and anemochory in non-woody plants. Water availability may be the principal factor responsible for variation among dispersal syndromes. The proportion of ruderal species in the non-woody component explains the differences in syndromes between growth forms.",2016

Only small quantitative differences have been found between the chemical composition of leaves and stems essential oil, being 1,8-cineole the most representative compound of this essences. However, the essential oil obtained from flowers showed also qualitative differences, with a chemical composition very close to the described for some Lavandula species which share habitat with Spanish sage and whose essential oils are basically obtained from their inflorescences (L. angustifolia, L. latifolia and L. x intermedia).

An improved method for pollen release from anther: a case study with mangroves,pollen production; mangrove community; ultrasonic treatment; pollen rupture,POACEAE FAMILY; PERFORMANCE; TREES,"The estimation of pollen production is widely used in pollination and reproductive ecology, aerobiology and pollen-vegetation relationship studies. Pollen release is the key step in estimating pollen production and therefore, the technique used to release pollen is critical. Three methods, the drying method (DM), mechanical method (MM) and chemical method (CM), are used to determine the amount of pollen released from anthers. Few studies have compared the results obtained from each method, making it difficult to determine which method is most appropriate in a given situation. In this study, we compared existing methods with a new method that increases the amount of pollen released from anthers. Eight species of mangrove trees from the Neilingding-Futian National Nature Reserve were selected for study. We combined the MM and CM to produce a new method (the ultrasonic method, UM). To determine the best ultrasonic treatment time using the UM, different durations were tested and the various responses were analysed. The relationships between pollen rupture and the ultrasonic treatment time, pollen size, exine thickness and aperture size were analysed. Finally, four methods for pollen release from anthers were compared. The results indicated that the UM could be an efficient method to release pollen from the anther. To avoid pollen rupture, ultrasonic treatment times in the UM should be less than 30s. The pollen rupture rate was significantly correlated with the ultrasonic treatment time (r=0.618, p<0.001) and the aperture size (r=0.248, p=0.036). This comparative experiment indicated that the UM can generate a greater pollen yield than other methods while causing less pollen rupture than the MM. Therefore, the UM may be suitable for more plant species and more accurate for pollen production estimates than the existing three methods, particularly when estimating pollen production in all community plants.",2016

This study focuses on the manner in which bees adapt their foraging behavior as a function of variation in tree coverage on a landscape scale. Study sites were characterized by satellite images and categorized according to percentage of tree cover: low (50-62%), medium (63-77%), and high (77-83%). Honey samples were collected from several apiaries in each landscape. In order to identify resources used by Apis mellifera, samples were analyzed according to melissopalynology. A random forest model analysis performed to compare different honeys did not show significant differences between honeys in any given landscape. Nevertheless, percentage of tree cover was positively correlated, in a significant manner, with the relative proportion of pollen from trees and from shrubs present in honey samples. These analyses, along with physical-chemical and sensory analyses were used to develop a first standard of reference for coffee garden honey.",2016

A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section ""other invertebrates"" review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats.",2015

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators, and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology, including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats. Results: We report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera, we identify deeply conserved similarities, as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees, indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees, and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization, including development and behavior, show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction, and striking differences in microRNAs, potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits. Conclusions: These two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies. Overall, gene repertoires suggest that the route to advanced eusociality in bees was mediated by many small changes in many genes and processes, and not by notable expansion or depauperation.",2015

However, a missed component of biodiversity loss that often accompanies or even precedes species disappearance is the extinction of ecological interactions. Here, we propose a novel model that (i) relates the diversity of both species and interactions along a gradient of environmental deterioration and (ii) explores how the rate of loss of ecological functions, and consequently of ecosystem services, can be accelerated or restrained depending on how the rate of species loss covaries with the rate of interactions loss. We find that the loss of species and interactions are decoupled, such that ecological interactions are often lost at a higher rate. This implies that the loss of ecological interactions may occur well before species disappearance, affecting species functionality and ecosystems services at a faster rate than species extinctions. We provide a number of empirical case studies illustrating these points. Our approach emphasizes the importance of focusing on species interactions as the major biodiversity component from which the health' of ecosystems depends.",2015

The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials, benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity, but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees) and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystemfunctions regulating soil and water quality, pest control, pollination, ecosystem resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes, invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators, consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and / invertebrate populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling, were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and/ or fipronil at environmentally relevant concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish do not appear to be as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall, we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem services that humans fundamentally depend on.",2015

Tests of hypotheses to account for such diversity have been stymied by the lack of a fully resolved broad-scale phylogeny. Here, we provide such a phylogeny, based on 75 chloroplast genes for 39 species representing all orchid subfamilies and 16 of 17 tribes, time-calibrated against 17 angiosperm fossils. A supermatrix analysis places an additional 144 species based on three plastid genes. Orchids appear to have arisen roughly 112 million years ago (Mya); the subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae diverged from each other at the end of the Cretaceous; and the eight tribes and three previously unplaced subtribes of the upper epidendroids diverged rapidly from each other between 37.9 and 30.8 Mya. Orchids appear to have undergone one significant acceleration of net species diversification in the orchidoids, and two accelerations and one deceleration in the upper epidendroids. Consistent with theory, such accelerations were correlated with the evolution of pollinia, the epiphytic habit, CAM photosynthesis, tropical distribution (especially in extensive cordilleras), and pollination via Lepidoptera or euglossine bees. Deceit pollination appears to have elevated the number of orchid species by one-half but not via acceleration of the rate of net diversification. The highest rate of net species diversification within the orchids (0.382 sp sp 1 My-1) is 6.8 times that at the Asparagales crown.",2015

There is, however, little direct evidence of yield benefits from ecological intensification on commercial farms growing globally important foodstuffs (grains, oilseeds and pulses). We replicated two treatments removing 3 or 8% of land at the field edge from production to create wildlife habitat in 50-60 ha patches over a 900 ha commercial arable farm in central England, and compared these to a business as usual control (no land removed). In the control fields, crop yields were reduced by as much as 38% at the field edge. Habitat creation in these lower yielding areas led to increased yield in the cropped areas of the fields, and this positive effect became more pronounced over 6 years. As a consequence, yields at the field scale were maintained-and, indeed, enhanced for some crops-despite the loss of cropland for habitat creation. These results suggested that over a 5-year crop rotation, there would be no adverse impact on overall yield in terms of monetary value or nutritional energy. This study provides a clear demonstration that wildlife-friendly management which supports ecosystem services is compatible with, and can even increase, crop yields.",2015

The potential for infectious pathogens to spillover and emerge from managed populations to wildlife communities is poorly understood, but ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors are all likely to influence the initial exposure and subsequent infection, spread and impact of disease. Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. 2. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. 3. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within-and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. 4. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. 5. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity.

A review,Agro-ecology; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Competition; Crop production; Trophic network,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; APIS-MELLIFERA L.; HONEY-BEES; LAND-USE; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; OILSEED RAPE,"Agricultural intensification has led to the decrease of the diversity of wild and domestic pollinators. For instance, honeybees declined by 59 % in 61 years in the USA. About 35 % of major crops in the world depend on pollination services, and 3-8 % of world crop production will disappear without pollinators. Indeed, pollination provides several ecosystem services such as enabling crop and honey productions, regulating weeds and other cultural services. Agricultural intensification has also decreased weed diversity by about 50 % in 70 years because massive herbicide sprays have reduced the competition between weeds and crops. Nevertheless, weeds are at the basis of agricultural foodwebs, providing food to many living organisms. In particular, weeds provide flowers for pollinating insects including honey and wild bees. Here, we review the decline of weeds and bees. We discuss the effect of bees and pollination on crop production. We describe the complex interactions between bee pollinators, e.g. honey and wild bees, and landscape habitats such as crop fields and semi-natural elements. For that, we focus on spatial and temporal effects on flower resources. We show that weed abundance can reduce crop yields, thus inducing conflict with farmers. But weed abundance enhances regulating services by ensuring the survival of honeybees in the absence of oil seed crops. Weed abundance also enhances pollination services and, in turn, honey yield for the benefit of beekeepers. Weed abundance has also improved the survival of wild flora and the socio-cultural value of landscapes, a major request from the public. From those findings, we present a conceptual framework allowing to define ecological engineering options based upon ecosystem services of weeds and pollinators.",2015
Neonicotinoid Insecticides and Their Impacts on Bees: A Systematic Review of Research Approaches and Identification of Knowledge Gaps,,APIS-MELLIFERA L; BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; DECREASES FORAGING SUCCESS; PESTICIDE RISK-ASSESSMENT; COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; SEED-TREATED CANOLA; HONEY-BEES; NATIVE BEES; POTENTIAL EXPOSURE,"It has been suggested that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82%), involved the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (78%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines.",2015
Increased efficiency in identifying mixed pollen samples by meta-barcoding with a dual-indexing approach,DNA barcoding; High throughput sequencing; Illumina MiSeq platform; ITS2; Next generation sequencing; NGS; Osmia; Palynology; Pollination ecology,RESOLUTION POLLEN; DNA; SEQUENCES; HONEY; MIXTURES; SEARCH; RECORD; DIET; BEES,"Background: Meta-barcoding of mixed pollen samples constitutes a suitable alternative to conventional pollen identification via light microscopy. Current approaches however have limitations in practicability due to low sample throughput and/or inefficient processing methods, e.g. separate steps for amplification and sample indexing. Results: We thus developed a new primer-adapter design for high throughput sequencing with the Illumina technology that remedies these issues. It uses a dual-indexing strategy, where sample-specific combinations of forward and reverse identifiers attached to the barcode marker allow high sample throughput with a single sequencing run. It does not require further adapter ligation steps after amplification. We applied this protocol to 384 pollen samples collected by solitary bees and sequenced all samples together on a single Illumina MiSeq v2 flow cell. According to rarefaction curves, 2,000-3,000 high quality reads per sample were sufficient to assess the complete diversity of 95% of the samples. We were able to detect 650 different plant taxa in total, of which 95% were classified at the species level. Together with the laboratory protocol, we also present an update of the reference database used by the classifier software, which increases the total number of covered global plant species included in the database from 37,403 to 72,325 (93% increase). Conclusions: This study thus offers improvements for the laboratory and bioinformatical workflow to existing approaches regarding data quantity and quality as well as processing effort and cost-effectiveness. Although only tested for pollen samples, it is furthermore applicable to other research questions requiring plant identification in mixed and challenging samples.",2015
Integrating network ecology with applied conservation: a synthesis and guide to implementation,Adaptive management; biodiversity conservation; ecological integrity; ecosystem functions; indicators; interaction networks; islands; pollination,PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS; ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SPECIES INTERACTION NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; ALIEN PLANTS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FLOWER-VISITORS; SEED DISPERSAL; BIODIVERSITY; SPECIALIZATION,"Ecological networks are a useful tool to study the complexity of biotic interactions at a community level. Advances in the understanding of network patterns encourage the application of a network approach in other disciplines than theoretical ecology, such as biodiversity conservation. So far, however, practical applications have been meagre. Here we present a framework for network analysis to be harnessed to advance conservation management by using plant-pollinator networks and islands as model systems. Conservation practitioners require indicators to monitor and assess management effectiveness and validate overall conservation goals. By distinguishing between two network attributes, the 'diversity' and 'distribution' of interactions, on three hierarchical levels (species, guild/group and network) we identify seven quantitative metrics to describe changes in network patterns that have implications for conservation. Diversity metrics are partner diversity, vulnerability/generality, interaction diversity and interaction evenness, and distribution metrics are the specialization indices d' and H'(2), and modularity. Distribution metrics account for sampling bias and may therefore be suitable indicators to detect human-induced changes to plant-pollinator communities, thus indirectly assessing the structural and functional robustness and integrity of ecosystems. We propose an implementation pathway that outlines the stages that are required to successfully embed a network approach in biodiversity conservation. Most importantly, only if conservation action and study design are aligned by practitioners and ecologists through joint experiments, are the findings of a conservation network approach equally beneficial for advancing adaptive management and ecological network theory. We list potential obstacles to the framework, highlight the shortfall in empirical, mostly experimental, network data and discuss possible solutions.",2015
Functional mismatch in a bumble bee pollination mutualism under climate change,,COROLLA TUBES; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; SHIFTS; COMPETITION; PHENOLOGY; DENSITY; DECLINE,"Ecological partnerships, or mutualisms, are globally widespread, sustaining agriculture and biodiversity. Mutualisms evolve through the matching of functional traits between partners, such as tongue length of pollinators and flower tube depth of plants. Long-tongued pollinators specialize on flowers with deep corolla tubes, whereas shorter-tongued pollinators generalize across tube lengths. Losses of functional guilds because of shifts in global climate may disrupt mutualisms and threaten partner species. We found that in two alpine bumble bee species, decreases in tongue length have evolved over 40 years. Co-occurring flowers have not become shallower, nor are small-flowered plants more prolific. We argue that declining floral resources because of warmer summers have favored generalist foraging, leading to a mismatch between shorter-tongued bees and the longer-tubed plants they once pollinated.",2015

High annual losses of honey bee colonies in North America and in some parts of Europe have profound ecological and economic implications. Colony losses have been attributed to multiple factors including RNA viruses, thus understanding bee antiviral defense mechanisms may result in the development of strategies that mitigate colony losses. Honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms include RNA-interference, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered signal transduction cascades, and reactive oxygen species generation. However, the relative importance of these and other pathways is largely uncharacterized. Herein we review the current understanding of honey bee antiviral defense mechanisms and suggest important avenues for future investigation.",2015
Breeding Annual Grain Legumes for Sustainable Agriculture: New Methods to Approach Complex Traits and Target New Cultivar Ideotypes,breeding; forage; ideotype; ecosystem service; food; grain legumes,BEAN PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS; PEA PISUM-SATIVUM; CICER-ARIETINUM L.; VICIA-FABA L; SOYBEAN/PIGEONPEA INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; MEDITERRANEAN-TYPE ENVIRONMENTS; HOST-BACTERIA INTERACTIONS; NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; LENTIL LENS-CULINARIS; LATHYRUS-SATIVUS,"Although yield and total biomass produced by annual legumes remain major objectives for breeders, other issues such as environment-friendly, resource use efficiency including symbiotic performance, resilient production in the context of climate change, adaptation to sustainable cropping systems (reducing leaching, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide residues), adaptation to diverse uses (seeds for feed, food, non-food, forage or green manure) and finally new ecological services such as pollinator protection, imply the need for definition of new ideotypes and development of innovative genotypes to enhance their commercialization. Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for the ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, water). Shoot architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic constraint protection (parasitic weeds, diseases or insects) reducing pesticide use. Variable maturity periods and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are key features for the introduction of annual legumes to low input cropping systems and for enlarging cultivated area. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific cultivars and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield. A holistic approach in legume breeding is important for defining objectives with farmers, processors and consumers. The cultivar structures are likely to be more complex, combining genotypes, plant species and associated symbionts. New tools to build and evaluate them are important if legumes are to deliver their exciting potential in terms of agricultural productivity and sustainability as well as for feed and food.",2015

Here we synthesize the available literature on their population ecology in an attempt to find patterns that may characterize them. Epiphytes tend to have specialized pollination systems frequently involving animal vectors, resulting in a mixture of selfing and outcrossing that ensures abundant seed production. Seed dispersal is anemochorous in 84 % of the species and is pivotal for the establishment of new local populations within metapopulation. Seed germination is highly dependent on specific environmental conditions, resulting in seedling establishment in particular microhabitats on phorophytes. Individual growth rates are slow and limited by the low water and nutrient availability characteristic of the epiphytic habitat. Population growth rates (X) are close to unity and depend mostly on the survival of adults. This plant group is highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.",2015

Therefore, the raging debate regarding honey bee decline has surpassed the realm of beekeepers, academia, industry and regulatory agencies and now also encompasses non-governmental agencies, media, fiction writers and the general public. The early interest and concern about honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) soon shifted to the bigger issue of pollinator decline, with a focus on the potential involvement of pesticides in such a phenomenon. Pesticides were previously recognised as the potential culprits of the reported declines, particularly the neonicotinoid insecticides owing to their widespread and peculiar use in agriculture. However, the evidence for the potential pivotal role of these neonicotinoids in honey bee decline remains a matter of debate, with an increased recognition of the multifactorial nature of the problem and the lack of a direct association between the noted decline and neonicotinoid use. The focus on the decline of honey bee populations subsequently spread to other species, and bumblebees became another matter of concern, particularly in Europe and the United States. Other bee species, ones that are particularly important in other regions of the world, remain the object of little concern (unjustifiably so). Furthermore, the continuous focus on neonicotinoids is also in need of revision, as the current evidence suggests that a broad spectrum of compounds deserve attention. Here we address both shortcomings.",2015
A simple stochastic model for complex coextinctions in mutualistic networks: robustness decreases with connectance,Complexity-stability; extinction cascades; horizontal cascades; seed dispersal; network disassembly; network robustness; pollination; simulation model; stochastic coextinction model; topological coextinction model,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; FOOD WEBS; SECONDARY EXTINCTIONS; CASCADING EXTINCTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; STABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; DISRUPTION; TOLERANCE,"Understanding and predicting species extinctions and coextinctions is a major goal of ecological research in the face of a biodiversity crisis. Typically, models based on network topology are used to simulate coextinctions in mutualistic networks. However, such topological models neglect two key biological features of species interactions: variation in the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism, and variation in the relative importance of each interacting partner. By incorporating both types of variation, we developed a stochastic coextinction model capable of simulating extinction cascades far more complex than those observed in previous topological models. Using a set of empirical mutualistic networks, we show that the traditional topological model may either underestimate or overestimate the number and likelihood of coextinctions, depending on the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism. More importantly, contrary to topological models, our stochastic model predicts extinction cascades to be more likely in highly connected mutualistic communities.",2015
Keystone species in seed dispersal networks are mainly determined by dietary specialization,,BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; FRUGIVOROUS BATS; OIL-FLOWERS; FRUIT BATS; BODY-SIZE; PLANTS; PHYLLOSTOMIDAE,"A central issue in ecology is the definition and identification of keystone species, i.e. species that are relatively more important than others for maintaining community structure and ecosystem functioning. Network theory has been pointed out as a robust theoretical framework to enhance the operationality of the keystone species concept. We used the concept of centrality as a proxy for a species 'relative importance for the structure of seed dispersal networks composed of either frugivorous bats or birds and their food-plants. Centrality was expected to be determined mainly by dietary specialization, but also by body mass and geographic range size. Across 15 Neotropical datasets, only specialized frugivore species reached the highest values of centrality. Furthermore, the centrality of specialized frugivores varied widely within and among networks, whereas that of secondary and opportunistic frugivores was consistently low. A mixed-effects model showed that centrality was best explained by dietary specialization, but not by body mass or range size. Furthermore, the relationship between centrality and those three ecological correlates differed between bat-and bird-fruit networks. Our findings suggest that dietary specialization is key to understand what makes a frugivore species a keystone in seed dispersal networks, and that taxonomic identity also plays a significant role. Specialized frugivores may play a central role in network structuring and ecosystem functioning, which has important implications for conservation and restoration.",2015
Three R2R3-MYB Transcription Factors Regulate Distinct Floral Pigmentation Patterning in Phalaenopsis spp.,,ANTHOCYANIN BIOSYNTHESIS; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; GENE-EXPRESSION; PETUNIA ENCODES; REPEAT PROTEIN; SPOT FORMATION; FLOWER TEPALS; MYB; ORCHID,"Orchidaceae are well known for their fascinating floral morphologic features, specialized pollination, and distinctive ecological strategies. With their long-lasting flowers of various colors and pigmentation patterning, Phalaenopsis spp. have become important ornamental plants worldwide. In this study, we identified three R2R3-MYB transcription factors PeMYB2, PeMYB11, and PeMYB12. Their expression profiles were concomitant with red color formation in Phalaenopsis spp. flowers. Transient assay of overexpression of three PeMYBs verified that PeMYB2 resulted in anthocyanin accumulation, and these PeMYBs could activate the expression of three downstream structural genes Phalaenopsis spp. Flavanone 3-hydroxylase5, Phalaenopsis spp. Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase1, and Phalaenopsis spp. Anthocyanidin synthase3. In addition, these three PeMYBs participated in the distinct pigmentation patterning in a single flower, which was revealed by virus-induced gene silencing. In the sepals/petals, silencing of PeMYB2, PeMYB11, and PeMYB12 resulted in the loss of the full-red pigmentation, red spots, and venation patterns, respectively. Moreover, different pigmentation patterning was regulated by PeMYBs in the sepals/petals and lip. PeMYB11 was responsive to the red spots in the callus of the lip, and PeMYB12 participated in the full pigmentation in the central lobe of the lip. The differential pigmentation patterning was validated by RNA in situ hybridization. Additional assessment was performed in six Phalaenopsis spp. cultivars with different color patterns. The combined expression of these three PeMYBs in different ratios leads to a wealth of complicated floral pigmentation patterning in Phalaenopsis spp.",2015

Thus, quantifying such strength is crucial to understand how species interactions shape communities and ecosystems. Although the concepts and measurement of interaction strength in food webs have received much attention, there has been comparatively little progress in the context of mutualism. We propose a conceptual scheme for studying the strength of plant-animal mutualistic interactions. We first review the interaction strength concepts developed for food webs, and explore how these concepts have been applied to mutualistic interactions. We then outline and explain a conceptual framework for defining ecological effects in plant-animal mutualisms. We give recommendations for measuring interaction strength from data collected in field studies based on a proposed approach for the assessment of interaction strength in plant-animal mutualisms. This approach is conceptually integrative and methodologically feasible, as it focuses on two key variables usually measured in field studies: the frequency of interactions and the fitness components influenced by the interactions.",2015

Here, we examine beta-diversity of ecological networks by using pollination networks sampled across the Canary Islands. We show that adjacent and distant communities are more and less similar, respectively, in their composition of plants, pollinators and interactions than expected from random distributions. We further show that replacement of species is the major driver of interaction turnover and that this contribution increases with distance. Finally, we quantify that species-specific partner compositions (here called partner fidelity) deviate from random partner use, but vary as a result of ecological and geographical variables. In particular, breakdown of partner fidelity was facilitated by increasing geographical distance, changing abundances and changing linkage levels, but was not related to the geographical distribution of the species. This highlights the importance of space when comparing communities of interacting species and may stimulate a rethinking of the spatial interpretation of interaction networks. Moreover, geographical interaction dynamics and its causes are important in our efforts to anticipate effects of large-scale changes, such as anthropogenic disturbances.",2015

These barriers are often divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization (premating isolation), and those that occur after mating (postmating isolation), and much debate has surrounded the relative importance of these categories. Within the species Mimulus aurantiacus, red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes occur in the southwest corner of California, and a hybrid zone occurs where their ranges overlap. We show that premating barriers are exclusively responsible for isolation in this system, with both ecogeographic and pollinator isolation contributing significantly to total isolation. Postmating forms of reproductive isolation have little or no impact on gene flow, indicating that hybrids likely contribute to introgression at neutral loci. Analysis of molecular variation across thousands of restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) markers reveals that the genomes of these taxa are largely undifferentiated. However, structure analysis shows that these taxa are distinguishable genetically, likely due to the impact of loci underlying differentiated adaptive phenotypes. These data exhibit the power of divergent natural selection to maintain highly differentiated phenotypes in the face of gene flow during the early stages of speciation.",2015

Birds devour pests, pollinate flowers, disperse seeds, scavenge carrion, cycle nutrients, and modify the environment in ways that benefit other species. Investigation of these ecosystem functions directly as ecosystem services has grown immensely over the last two decades and the ecological relevance of birds is well established. Birds are also observed, fed, and used as artistic and spiritual inspiration by millions of people around the globe. Yet the economic relevance of birds is not widely appreciated and the economic relevance to human society of birds' ecological roles is even less understood. Quantifying the services provided by birds is crucial to understand their importance for ecosystems and for the people that benefit from them. In this paper, we briefly review the rise and fall of economic ornithology and call for a new economic ornithology with heightened standards and a holistic focus within the ecosystem services approach. Birds' ecological roles, and therefore, ecosystem services, are critical to the health of many ecosystems and to human well-being. By understanding and valuing bird services and disservices through careful natural history research, we can better assess the environmental consequences of bird declines and extinctions and communicate these findings to the public and policy makers, thereby increasing public support for the conservation of birds and their habitats.",2015

Yet, the specific stimuli used by the bees to locate their host flowers have remained elusive. This study identifies diacetin, a volatile acetylated glycerol, as a floral signal compound shared by unrelated oil plants from around the globe. Electrophysiological measurements of antennae and behavioural assays identified diacetin as the key volatile used by oil-collecting bees to locate their host flowers. Furthermore, electrophysiological measurements indicate that only oil-collecting bees are capable of detecting diacetin. The structural and obvious biosynthetic similarity between diacetin and associated floral oils make it a reliable cue for oil-collecting bees. It is easily perceived by oil bees, but can't be detected by other potential pollinators. Therefore, diacetin represents the first demonstrated private communication channel in a pollination system.",2015

Moths (Lepidoptera) are the major nocturnal pollinators of flowers. However, their importance and contribution to the provision of pollination ecosystem services may have been under-appreciated. Evidence was identified that moths are important pollinators of a diverse range of plant species in diverse ecosystems across the world. 2. Moth populations are known to be undergoing significant declines in several European countries. Among the potential drivers of this decline is increasing light pollution. The known and possible effects of artificial night lighting upon moths were reviewed, and suggest how artificial night lighting might in turn affect the provision of pollination by moths. The need for studies of the effects of artificial night lighting upon whole communities of moths was highlighted. 3. An ecological network approach is one valuable method to consider the effects of artificial night lighting upon the provision of pollination by moths, as it provides useful insights into ecosystem functioning and stability, and may help elucidate the indirect effects of artificial light upon communities of moths and the plants they pollinate. 4. It was concluded that nocturnal pollination is an ecosystem process that may potentially be disrupted by increasing light pollution, although the nature of this disruption remains to be tested.",2015

Possible harm to bees has resulted in the European Commission imposing a precautionary two-year moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids on bee-attractive crops from 2013. Recent laboratory and semi-field studies on colony-level effects of neonicotinoids assumed exclusive or near-exclusive levels of colony foraging on a treated crop. But is this a realistic assumption? Six honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies were monitored over two springs (April-May 2011/12) in two neighbouring locations (urban and rural) in and near Brighton, UK, to quantify foraging on oilseed rape, the most widespread beeattractive crop in the UK, by decoding waggle dances and trapping pollen. The study area was representative of the UK agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the national average (3.3-3.9% vs 3.1%). The amount of foraging on oilseed rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low, 0-0.02% for the urban and 2-26% for the rural location. Almost all foraging, 91-99%, was within 2 km, even though honey bees can forage at distances of over 10 km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14% of pollen pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4% from urban hives. The results of this study have implications for policy as they cast doubt on the generality of some previous studies on colony-level effects on social bees conducted in laboratory and semi-field settings.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Schistonchus s.l. is polyphyletic, and the composition of the three major clades is outlined, together with information on nematode morphology, plant host species, associated pollinating wasp species, and distribution. Biological information and collection data is presented for Schistonchus s.l. from Ficus sycones (Moracea) in Africa, Australia, Asia and Central America, and its putative phylogeny is discussed based on molecular and morphological evidence. Both wasps and figs are millions of years old and have worldwide distribution in tropical areas, i.e., opportunities for Schistonchus s.l.-like nematodes to have evolved could have occurred more than once. In addition, figs and their pollinating wasps have variable life histories, which could have provided opportunities for Schistonchus s.l. to also develop different life histories. However, these histories occur inside fig sycones and in association with wasps, which has apparently led to evolutionary convergence and extreme morphological conservatism. Diagnostic characters and their states, derived from examination of described species and morphospecies of Schistonchus s.l. and informed by molecular phylogenetic inferences, are discussed and illustrated. Schistonchus sensu stricto is redefined, and Ficophagus n. gen. and Martininema n. gen. are proposed. Schistonchus s. s. is morphologically characterised by having the excretory pore opening in the region of, or posterior to, the metacorpus; Ficophagus n. gen. by having the excretory pore opening very near the cephalic region; and Martininema n. gen. by having it opening at the anterior end of the metacorpus. Several species of Schistonchus s. s. have a labial disc, but there is no evidence of this in either Ficophagus n. gen. or Martininema n. gen.",2015

Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.",2015

Specifically, we tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) that areas with high habitat suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sustain higher effective population sizes, resulting in increased levels of genetic diversity; and (2) that populations from areas with lower habitat stability show higher levels of genetic admixture due to their recurrent colonization by individuals originating from genetically differentiated populations. Furthermore, we analysed the relative importance of past and current habitat suitability and their additive effects on contemporary patterns of genetic structure. Location California, USA. Methods We sampled 160 individuals from 33 localities across the distribution range of the canyon live oak in California and then combined information from 13 nuclear microsatellite DNA markers and climate niche modelling to study patterns of genetic variation in this species. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to analyse geographical patterns of genetic structure and admixture, and circuit theory to generate isolation-by-resistance (IBR) distance matrices. Results We found that the degree of genetic admixture was higher in localities with lower inferred population stability, but that genetic diversity was not associated with habitat suitability or stability. Landscape genetic analyses identified habitat stability as the primary driver of population genetic differentiation. Main conclusions This study shows that habitat stability can be a major factor shaping genetic variation in wind-pollinated trees and supports the idea that stable regions contribute to genetic connectivity across different climatic periods. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report an association between patterns of genetic admixture and stability of local habitat.",2015

Such processes include inter alia primary productivity, detritus decomposition, pollination, soil formation, and nutrient uptake and fixation. Insights into the abiotic, biotic, and spatial factors regulating these supporting ecosystem processes have arisen from within multiple fields of ecology which have not always been well integrated, including research on biodiversityecosystem functioning (B-EF) and biodiversityecosystem service (B-ES) relationships, meta-ecosystem ecology, and ecological resilience. Here, we draw together insights from these fields towards a framework suitable for addressing impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem processes and the services they support. We further discuss application of portfolio theory and a trait-based framework as unifying approaches in the assessment and management of ecosystem functioning and services, and identify a set of resilience attributes useful for assessing the resilience of ecosystem structure, functioning, and service delivery. Finally, we discuss future research challenges and opportunities, including uncertainties involved in linking species traits and interactions with ecosystem functioning and services. We conclude that the necessary theory and tools are already in place to begin the unification of B-EF, B-ES, meta-ecosystem, and resilience frameworks and to test their application in the assessment and management of ecosystem services.",2015

Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70056 records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and traitxland-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats.Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services. Our results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.

Yet, specialization is rarely quantified across several ecological niche axes and variables beyond the link between morphological and dietary specialization have received little attention. Here, we provide a quantitative evaluation of ecological specialization in a coral reef fish assemblage (f. Acanthuridae) along one fundamental and two realized niche axes. Specifically, we examined ecological specialization in 10 surgeonfish species with regards to morphology and two realized niche axes associated with diet and foraging microhabitat utilization using a recently developed multidimensional framework. We then investigated the potential relationships between morphological and behavioural specialization. These relationships differed markedly from the traditional ecomorphological paradigm. While morphological specialization showed no relationship with dietary specialization, it exhibited a strong relationship with foraging microhabitat specialization. However, this relationship was inverted: species with specialized morphologies were microhabitat generalists, whereas generalized morphotypes were microhabitat specialists. Interestingly, this mirrors relationships found in plant-pollinator communities and may also be applicable to other ecosystems, highlighting the potential importance of including niche axes beyond dietary specialization into ecomorphological frameworks. On coral reefs, it appears that morphotypes commonly perceived as most generalized may, in fact, be specialized in exploiting flat and easily accessible microhabitats.",2015

We test this hypothesis for the Chinese angiosperm flora and assess additional effects of growth form, deciduousness, pollination mode and fruit type. We further examine whether the phylogenetic conservatism of flowering phenology tends to increase from tropical to temperate latitudes. LocationChina. methods the midpoint of flowering time for 19,631 angiosperm species present in China was compiled. The phylogenetic signal for flowering time was evaluated for the whole country using the Blomberg K-value (adjusted for circular data). We then regressed the phylogenetic signal for 28 provinces as a function of their latitude. An analysis of variance for circular data was conducted to test the differences among growth forms. Watson-Williams tests for circular flowering data were used to compare flowering dates between deciduous and evergreen species, animal-pollinated and wind-pollinated species, and fleshy and non-fleshy fruits. results the results support the phylogenetic constraint hypothesis. The phylogenetic signal at the whole country scale was lower than that at the province scale. Phylogenetic signal was also lower at tropical latitudes than at temperate latitudes. Flowering dates were associated with biological traits, with growth form having the largest effect. Main conclusions flowering phenology was constrained by phylogeny, and so one should account for phylogeny when studying the underlying drivers of phenology. The strength of phylogenetic conservatism appears weaker at larger scales and becomes stronger towards temperate regions. Flowering phenology also varies predictably according to biological traits such as growth form, suggesting that both phylogeny and traits could be used to inform the flowering times of species for which no phenology data are available. It remains to be tested whether the phylogenetic signal for other functional traits putatively related with flowering time also increases with latitude.",2015

Biotic interactions between co-occurring species, however, are an important additional influence. We review the importance of interactions with food and nectar plants (as resources) in determining the distribution of phytophagous and pollinating insects (as consumers). We use biological recording datasets for seven taxonomic groups to quantify the relationship between the geographical distributions within Britain of 1265 phytophagous insects and their associated food plants, representing 9128 interactions in total. We find a consistent pattern across taxonomic groups in that individual phytophagous insect species rarely utilize the full range of their food plants and the relationship between the range sizes of insects and their food plants is not a simple linear one. For a small selection of phytophagous species where data are available, we highlight an association between changes in range and interactions with associated food plant species. Climate-driven range expansion may be constrained through disruption of trophic relationships between phytophagous insects and their food plants if they respond differently to abiotic drivers. By contrast, range expansion may be facilitated by temporary escape from natural enemies and/or exploitation of novel food plants that enable a broader set of habitats to be utilized. In a changing environment, some existing interactions will be disrupted but opportunities for novel interactions will also emerge, producing new assemblages and changes in distributions that will be dynamic yet hard to predict.",2015

In turn, many of these fauna are dependent on the flowering phenology of the plant species of such ecosystems. The impact of changes in climate, including climate extremes, on the interaction between these fauna and flora has not been identified or elucidated, yet influences on flowering phenology are already evident. These changes are well documented in the mid to high latitudes. However, there is emerging evidence that the flowering phenology, nectar/pollen production, and fruit production of long-lived trees in tropical and subtropical forests are also being impacted by changes in the frequency and severity of climate extremes. Here, we examine the implications of these changes for vertebrate fauna dependent on these resources. We review the literature to establish evidence for links between climate extremes and flowering phenology, elucidating the nature of relationships between different vertebrate taxa and flowering regimes. We combine this information with climate change projections to postulate about the likely impacts on nectar, pollen and fruit resource availability and the consequences for dependent vertebrate fauna. The most recent climate projections show that the frequency and intensity of climate extremes will increase during the 21st century. These changes are likely to significantly alter mass flowering and fruiting events in the tropics and subtropics, which are frequently cued by climate extremes, such as intensive rainfall events or rapid temperature shifts. We find that in these systems the abundance and duration of resource availability for vertebrate fauna is likely to fluctuate, and the time intervals between episodes of high resource availability to increase. The combined impact of these changes has the potential to result in cascading effects on ecosystems through changes in pollinator and seed dispersal ecology, and demands a focused research effort.",2015
Ontogenetic niche shifts matter in community ecology: a review and future perspectives,Alternative stable state; Metamorphosis; Ontogenetic development; Predator-prey mass ratio; Size-based approach,SIZE-STRUCTURED POPULATIONS; DENSITY-DEPENDENT DISPERSAL; COMPLEX LIFE-CYCLES; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; FOOD WEBS; BODY-SIZE; TROPHIC CASCADES; STABILITY; PREDATOR; ECOSYSTEMS,"Almost all organisms on Earth exhibit ontogenetic niche shifts, which causes great phenotypic variation among individuals and is thus considered to critically mediate community structure and dynamics. In contrast, community ecology has traditionally assumed that species are composed of identical individuals with invariant traits and ignored the potentially important ecological roles of ontogenetic niche shifts. To bridge the gap, here I briefly review ecologically relevant examples which show that basic insights of species-based community theories can be revised by including the ontogenetic perspective. Specifically, I focus on the most representative animals in the study of ontogenetic niche shifts, i.e., fish, insects, and amphibians. Notably, their ontogenetic niche shifts create novel views of community structure: (1) ontogenetic diet shifts of predatory fish couple pelagic and benthic food webs in aquatic systems, (2) ontogenetic shifts in interaction types of pollinating insects couple herbivory and pollination networks in terrestrial systems, and (3) ontogenetic habitat shifts of amphibians and aquatic insects couple aquatic and terrestrial metacommunities at interface areas. Dynamic models of such stage-structured communities suggest that their ontogenetic niche shifts may affect the community resilience and disturbance responses. Exploring more complex systems (e.g., where many species undergo ontogenetic niche shifts several times or continuously) is a future direction, for which describing body size relationships between interacting organisms would be a promising approach. I conclude that both theoretical and empirical advances are needed to facilitate the ontogenetic perspective for better understanding mechanisms underlying biodiversity and ecosystem functioning which are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance.",2015

Effective mangrove conservation requires the determination of species identity, management units, and genetic structure. Here, we investigate the genetic distinctiveness and genetic structure of an iconic but yet taxonomically confusing species complex Rhizophora mucronata and R. stylosa across their distributional range, by employing a suite of 20 informative nuclear SSR markers. Results: Our results demonstrated the general genetic distinctiveness of R. mucronata and R. stylosa, and potential hybridization or introgression between them. We investigated the population genetics of each species without the putative hybrids, and found strong genetic structure between oceanic regions in both R. mucronata and R. stylosa. In R. mucronata, a strong divergence was detected between populations from the Indian Ocean region (Indian Ocean and Andaman Sea) and the Pacific Ocean region (Malacca Strait, South China Sea and Northwest Pacific Ocean). In R. stylosa, the genetic break was located more eastward, between populations from South and East China Sea and populations from the Southwest Pacific Ocean. The location of these genetic breaks coincided with the boundaries of oceanic currents, thus suggesting that oceanic circulation patterns might have acted as a cryptic barrier to gene flow. Conclusions: Our findings have important implications on the conservation of mangroves, especially relating to replanting efforts and the definition of evolutionary significant units in Rhizophora species. We outlined the genetic structure and identified geographical areas that require further investigations for both R. mucronata and R. stylosa. These results serve as the foundation for the conservation genetics of R. mucronata and R. stylosa and highlighted the need to recognize the genetic distinctiveness of closely-related species, determine their respective genetic structure, and avoid artificially promoting hybridization in mangrove restoration programmes.",2015
Interplay between insects and plants: dynamic and complex interactions that have coevolved over millions of years but act in milliseconds,Chemical ecology; coevolution; herbivores; insect-plant interactions; pollinators; spatio-temporal dynamics,GREEN PEACH APHID; HOST-PLANT; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; VOLATILE EMISSIONS; MOLECULAR-PATTERNS; HERBIVORES DRIVE; ODOR PREFERENCE; ORAL SECRETIONS,"In an environment with changing availability and quality of host plants, phytophagous insects are under selection pressure to find quality hosts. They need to maximize their fitness by locating suitable plants and avoiding unsuitable ones. Thus, they have evolved a finely tuned sensory system, for detection of host cues, and a nervous system, capable of integrating inputs from sensory neurons with a high level of spatio-temporal resolution. Insect responses to cues are not fixed but depend on the context in which they are perceived, the physiological state of the insect, and prior learning experiences. However, there are examples of insects making 'mistakes' and being attracted to poor quality hosts. While insects have evolved ways of finding hosts, plants have been under selection pressure to do precisely the opposite and evade detection or defend themselves when attacked. Once on the plant, insect-associated molecules may trigger or suppress defence depending on whether the plant or the insect is ahead in evolutionary terms. Plant volatile emission is influenced by defence responses induced by insect feeding or oviposition which can attract natural enemies but repel herbivores. Conversely, plant reproductive fitness is increased by attraction of pollinators. Interactions can be altered by other organisms associated with the plant such as other insects, plant pathogens, or mycorrhizal fungi. Plant phenotype is plastic and can be changed by epigenetic factors in adaptation to periods of biotic stress. Space and time play crucial roles in influencing the outcome of interactions between insects and plants.",2015

Studies at community scale highlight variations in conservatism strength depending on the characteristics of the ecological interaction studied. However, the heterogeneity of datasets and methods used prevent to compare results between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here we perform such a comparison by taking plant-insect communities as a study case, with data on plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator networks. Our analysis reveals that plants acting as resources for herbivores exhibit the strongest conservatism in species interaction among the four interacting groups. Conservatism levels are similar for insect pollinators, insect herbivores and plants as interacting partners of pollinators, although insect pollinators tend to have a slightly higher conservatism than the two others. Our results thus clearly support the current view that within antagonistic networks, conservatism is stronger for species as resources than for species as consumer. Although the pattern tends to be opposite for plant-pollinator networks, our results suggest that asymmetry in conservatism is much less pronounced between the pollinators and the plant they interact with. We discuss these differences in conservatism strength in relation with the processes structuring plant-insect communities.",2015

In plants that attract pollinators with pollinator-specific chemical signals, geographical variation in pollinator species may indicate the presence of cryptic plant taxa. We investigated this phenomenon in the rare sexually deceptive orchid Drakaea elastica using a molecular phylogenetic analysis to resolve pollinator species boundaries, pollinator choice experiments and a population genetic study of the orchid. Pollinator choice experiments demonstrated the existence of two ecotypes within D.elastica, each attracting their own related but phylogenetically distinct pollinator species. Despite the presence of ecotypes, population genetic differentiation was low across populations at six microsatellite loci (F-ST=0.026). However, Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis revealed two genetic clusters, broadly congruent with the ecotype distributions. These ecotypes may represent adaptation to regional variation in pollinator availability and perhaps the early stages of speciation, with pronounced morphological and genetic differences yet to evolve. Resolution of the taxonomic status of the D.elastica ecotypes is required as this has implications for conservation efforts and allocation of management funding. Furthermore, any reintroduction programmes must incorporate knowledge of ecotype distribution and pollinator availability to ensure reproductive success in restored populations.",2015

Many bees collect both nectar (carbohydrates) and pollen (protein) on a single foraging bout, sometimes from different plant species. We tested whether individual bumblebees could learn colour associations with nectar and pollen rewards simultaneously in a foraging scenario where one floral type offered only nectar and the other only pollen. We found that bees readily learned multiple reward-colour associations, and when presented with novel floral targets generalized to colours similar to those trained for each reward type. These results expand the ecological significance of work on bee learning and raise new questions regarding the cognitive ecology of pollination.",2015

Multiple species interactions can lead to indirect ecological effects that have important fitness consequences and can cause nonadditive patterns of natural selection. Given that indirect ecological effects are common in nature, nonadditive selection may also be quite common. As a result, quantifying nonadditive selection resulting from indirect ecological effects may be critical for understanding adaptation in natural communities composed of many interacting species. We describe how to quantify the relative strength of nonadditive selection resulting from indirect ecological effects compared to the strength of pairwise selection. We develop a clear method for testing for nonadditive selection caused by indirect ecological effects and consider how it might affect adaptation in multispecies communities. We use two case studies to illustrate how our method can be applied to empirical data sets. Our results suggest that nonadditive selection caused by indirect ecological effects may be common in nature. Our hope is that trait-based approaches, combined with multifactorial experiments, will result in more estimates of nonadditive selection that reveal the relative importance of indirect ecological effects for evolution in a community context.",2015
Bats Are Acoustically Attracted to Mutualistic Carnivorous Plants,,ECHOLOCATION CALLS; SEXUAL SELECTION; PITCHER PLANTS; FRUIT BATS; PREY; PHYLLOSTOMIDAE; EXPLOITATION; PERCEPTION; FLOWER; ECHOES,"Mutualisms between plants and animals shape the world's ecosystems [1, 2]. In such interactions, achieving contact with the partner species is imperative. Plants regularly advertise themselves with signals that specifically appeal to the partner's perceptual preferences [3-5]. For example, many plants have acquired traits such as brightly colored, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators with visual, olfactory, or in the case of a few bat-pollinated flowers even acoustic stimuli in the form of echo-reflecting structures [6-9]. However, acoustic attraction in plants is rare compared to other advertisements and has never been found outside the pollination context and only in the Neotropics. We hypothesized that this phenomenon is more widespread and more diverse as plant-bat interactions also occur in the Paleotropics. In Borneo, mutualistic bats fertilize a carnivorous pitcher plant while roosting in its pitchers [10, 11]. The pitcher's orifice features a prolonged concave structure, which we predicted to distinctively reflect the bats' echolocation calls for a wide range of angles. This structure should facilitate the location and identification of pitchers even within highly cluttered surroundings. Pitchers lacking this structure should be less attractive for the bats. Ensonifications of the pitchers around their orifice revealed that this structure indeed acts as a multidirectional ultrasound reflector. In behavioral experiments where bats were confronted with differently modified pitchers, the reflector's presence clearly facilitated the finding and identification of pitchers. These results suggest that plants have convergently acquired reflectors in the Paleotropics and the Neotropics to acoustically attract bats, albeit for completely different ecological reasons.",2015

Such mechanisms may be top-down (predator, parasite or grazer controlled), bottom-up (resource-controlled) or involve non-trophic processes, such as pollination, seed dispersal or competition. We present results from an experiment investigating both top-down and bottom-up effects of artificial light at night on the population density of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum in a diverse artificial grassland community in the presence and absence of predators and under low-level light of different spectral composition. We found no evidence for top-down control of A. pisum in this system, but did find evidence for bottom-up effects mediated through the impact of light on flower head density in a leguminous food plant. These results suggest that physiological effects of light on a plant species within a diverse plant community can have detectable demographic effects on a specialist herbivore.",2015

Since the availability of floral resources at the landscape scale is a function of landscape composition, apiculturists have long recognized that landscape composition is a critical determinant of honey bee colony success. Nevertheless, very few studies present quantitative data relating colony success metrics to local landscape composition. We employed a beekeeper survey in conjunction with GIS-based landscape analysis to model colony success as a function of landscape composition in the State of Ohio, USA, a region characterized by intensive cropland, urban development, deciduous forest, and grassland. We found that colony food accumulation and wax production were positively related to cropland and negatively related to forest and grassland, a pattern that may be driven by the abundance of dandelion and clovers in agricultural areas compared to forest or mature grassland. Colony food accumulation was also negatively correlated with urban land cover in sites dominated by urban and agricultural land use, which does not support the popular opinion that the urban environment is more favorable to honey bees than cropland.",2015

In contrast to specialized flowers, identifying pollination niches of generalist flowers is a challenge. Consequently, how generalist pollination niches evolve is largely unknown. We apply tools from network theory and comparative methods to investigate the evolution of pollination niches among generalist species belonging to the genus Erysimum. These species have similar flowers. We found that the studied species may be grouped in several multidimensional niches separated not by a shift of pollinators, but instead by quantitative variation in the relative abundance of pollinator functional groups. These pollination niches did not vary in generalization degree; we did not find any evolutionary trend toward specialization within the studied clade. Furthermore, the evolution of pollination niche fitted to a Brownian motion model without phylogenetic signal, and was characterized by frequent events of niche convergences and divergences. We presume that the evolution of Erysimum pollination niches has occurred mostly by recurrent shifts between slightly different generalized pollinator assemblages varying spatially as a mosaic and without any change in specialization degree. Most changes in pollination niches do not prompt floral divergence, a reason why adaptation to pollinators is uncommon in generalist plants.",2015

The identity and effect of these factors may vary among coexisting species that differ in leaf habit, potentially resulting in temporally asynchronous patterns of seed production. In this study, we aim to identify the proximate causes of mast-seeding using two oak species with contrasting leaf habit that coexist in southern Spain, the deciduous Quercus canariensis and the evergreen Q.suber. Simultaneously, we review the literature on environmental drivers of mast-seeding in Mediterranean oaks, distinguishing between evergreen and deciduous species. Our results indicate that Mediterranean oaks are primarily sensitive to weather, mast-seeding being strongly correlated with water availability and air temperature, mainly in the spring and summer. The two study oak species were affected by weather in quite different ways, most likely because of different abiotic requirements as well as contrasting functional strategies of resource use and biomass allocation. Specifically, annual seed production in Q.canariensis was more severely limited by drought than in Q.suber, but responded positively to warmer spring temperatures.Q.canariensis showed a large interannual variability, whereas Q.suber exhibited much more constant seed production. These two species also exhibited a very low level of synchrony in their temporal patterns of seed crop size, most likely due to phenological differences in the processes of flowering and seed maturation.Synthesis. Our results indicate that weather plays a crucial role as a proximate driver of mast-seeding in Mediterranean oaks. We hypothesize that the current abundance of co-occurring species that differ in leaf habit could be altered under future climate change scenarios. The decline of seed production with drier conditions will be potentially greater in deciduous species, particularly those inhabiting wetter sites. Alternatively, the expected warmer temperatures could negatively affect evergreen species as a consequence of their more conservative strategy of biomass allocation. Our findings suggest that understanding how species with different functional or phenological attributes adjust their reproductive abilities to weather may enable us to infer the effects of ongoing environmental changes on population recruitment and dynamics.",2015

One or more participating mutualists may alter their host's phenotype, resulting in a shift in the host's ecological interactions with all other mutualists involved. Understanding the functional interplay of mutualists associated with the same host remains an important challenge in biology. Here, we show belowground nitrogen-fixing rhizobia on lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) alter their host plant's defensive mutualism with aboveground ants. We induced extrafloral nectar (EFN), an indirect defense acting through ant attraction. We also measured various nutritive and defensive plant traits, biomass, and counted ants on rhizobial and rhizobia-free plants. Rhizobia increased plant protein as well as cyanogenesis, a direct chemical defense against herbivores, but decreased EFN. Ants were significantly more attracted to rhizobia-free plants, and our structural equation model shows a strong link between rhizobia and reduced EFN as well as between EFN and ants: the sole path to ant recruitment. The rhizobia-mediated effects on simultaneously expressed defensive plant traits indicate rhizobia can have significant bottom-up effects on higher trophic levels. Our results show belowground symbionts play a critical and underestimated role in determining aboveground mutualistic interactions.",2015
The incidence and pattern of copollinator diversification in dioecious and monoecious figs,Breeding system; cospeciation; Ficus; fig-pollinating wasp; host specificity; host switching,KEYSTONE PLANT RESOURCE; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; POLLINATING WASPS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MIXED MODELS; FICUS; EVOLUTION; MORACEAE; MUTUALISM; HYBRIDIZATION,"Differences in breeding system are associated with correlated ecological and morphological changes in plants. In Ficus, dioecy and monoecy are strongly associated with different suites of traits (tree height, population density, fruiting frequency, pollinator dispersal ecology). Although approximately 30% of fig species are pollinated by multiple species of fig-pollinating wasps, it has been suggested that copollinators are rare in dioecious figs. Here, we test whether there is a connection between the fig breeding system and copollinator incidence and diversification by conducting a meta-analysis of molecular data from pollinators of 119 fig species that includes new data from 15 Asian fig species. We find that the incidence of copollinators is not significantly different between monoecious and dioecious Ficus. Surprisingly, while all copollinators in dioecious figs are sister taxa, only 32.1% in monoecious figs are sister taxa. We present hypotheses to explain those patterns and discuss their consequences on the evolution of this mutualism.",2015

Yet despite their importance, many aspects of bumble bee biology have remained enigmatic until the rise of the genetic and, more recently, genomic eras. Here, we review and synthesize new insights into the ecology, evolution and behaviour of bumble bees that have been gained using modern genetic and genomic techniques. Special emphasis is placed on four areas of bumble bee biology: the evolution of eusociality in this group, population-level processes, large-scale evolutionary relationships and patterns, and immunity and resistance to pesticides. We close with a prospective on the future of bumble bee genomics research, as this rapidly advancing field has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of bumble bees, particularly in regard to adaptation and resilience. Worldwide, many bumble bee populations are in decline. As such, throughout the review, connections are drawn between new molecular insights into bumble bees and our understanding of the causal factors involved in their decline. Ongoing and potential applications to bumble bee management and conservation are also included to demonstrate how genetics- and genomics-enabled research aids in the preservation of this threatened group.",2015

Here, we investigate potential and realized patterns of mating in distylous Luculia pinceana (Rubiaceae), a species with intramorph compatibility. Our analysis provides an opportunity to test Darwin's hypothesis that reciprocal herkogamy promotes disassortative pollen transfer. We combined measurements of sex-organ reciprocity and pollen production to predict potential pollen transfer and mating patterns in a population from SW China. Marker-based paternity analysis was then used to estimate realized patterns of disassortative and assortative mating at the individual and floral morph levels. Both potential and realized mating patterns indicated a significant component of disassortative mating, satisfying theoretical conditions for the maintenance of floral dimorphism. Levels of assortative mating (37.7%) were significantly lower than disassortative mating (62.3%), but numerous offspring resulting from intramorph mating were detected in the majority of maternal seed families in both floral morphs. Our results provide empirical support for Darwin's cross-promotion hypothesis on the function of reciprocal herkogamy, but indicate that in most heterostylous species strong diallelic incompatibility may be a general requirement for complete disassortative mating.

A hybrid behavioural rule of adaptation and drift explains the emergent architecture of antagonistic networks,adaptive behaviour; functional response; modularity; nestedness; node degree; optimal foraging,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FACILITATE BIODIVERSITY MAINTENANCE; FOOD-WEB COMPLEXITY; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NESTEDNESS; STABILITY; PERSISTENCE,"Ecological processes that can realistically account for network architectures are central to our understanding of how species assemble and function in ecosystems. Consumer species are constantly selecting and adjusting which resource species are to be exploited in an antagonistic network. Here we incorporate a hybrid behavioural rule of adaptive interaction switching and random drift into a bipartite network model. Predictions are insensitive to the model parameters and the initial network structures, and agree extremely well with the observed levels of modularity, nestedness and node-degree distributions for 61 real networks. Evolutionary and community assemblage histories only indirectly affect network structure by defining the size and complexity of ecological networks, whereas adaptive interaction switching and random drift carve out the details of network architecture at the faster ecological time scale. The hybrid behavioural rule of both adaptation and drift could well be the key processes for structure emergence in real ecological networks.",2015
Ecological Transition Predictably Associated with Gene Degeneration,parallel evolution; flower color; Penstemon; irreversibility,FLOWER COLOR EVOLUTION; PARALLEL EVOLUTION; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; FLORAL ANTHOCYANINS; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; MULTIPLE LEVELS; DOLLOS LAW; MUTATIONS; CONVERGENCE; PENSTEMON,"Gene degeneration or loss can significantly contribute to phenotypic diversification, but may generate genetic constraints on future evolutionary trajectories, potentially restricting phenotypic reversal. Such constraints may manifest as directional evolutionary trends when parallel phenotypic shifts consistently involve gene degeneration or loss. Here, we demonstrate that widespread parallel evolution in Penstemon from blue to red flowers predictably involves the functional inactivation and degeneration of the enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), an anthocyanin pathway enzyme required for the production of blue floral pigments. Other types of genetic mutations do not consistently accompany this phenotypic shift. This pattern may be driven by the relatively large mutational target size of degenerative mutations to this locus and the apparent lack of associated pleiotropic effects. The consistent degeneration of F3'5'H may provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed asymmetry in the direction of flower color evolution in Penstemon: Blue to red transitions are common, but reverse transitions have not been observed. Although phenotypic shifts in this system are likely driven by natural selection, internal constraints may generate predictable genetic outcomes and may restrict future evolutionary trajectories.",2015
The eco-evolutionary consequences of interspecific phenological asynchrony - a theoretical perspective,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; MIGRATORY BIRDS; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; POPULATION BIOLOGY; AVIAN REPRODUCTION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; BREEDING SEASONS; FLOWERING TIME,"The timing of biological events (phenology) is an important aspect of both a species' life cycle and how it interacts with other species and its environment. Patterns of phenological change have been given much scientific attention, particularly recently in relation to climate change. For pairs of interacting species, if their rates of phenological change differ, then this may lead to asynchrony between them and disruption of their ecological interactions. However it is often difficult to interpret differential rates of phenological change and to predict their ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review theoretical results regarding this topic, with special emphasis on those arising from life history theory, evolutionary game theory and population dynamic models. Much ecological research on phenological change builds upon the concept of match/mismatch, so we start by putting forward a simple but general model that captures essential elements of this concept. We then systematically compare the predictions of this baseline model with expectations from theory in which additional ecological mechanisms and features of species life cycles are taken into account. We discuss the ways in which the fitness consequences of interspecific phenological asynchrony may be weak, strong, or idiosyncratic. We discuss theory showing that synchrony is not necessarily an expected evolutionary outcome, and how population densities are not necessarily maximized by adaptation, and the implications of these findings. By bringing together theoretical developments regarding the eco-evolutionary consequences of phenological asynchrony, we provide an overview of available alternative hypotheses for interpreting empirical patterns as well as the starting point for the next generation of theory in this field.",2015
Road mortality potentially responsible for billions of pollinating insect deaths annually,Biodiversity; Diptera; Hymenoptera; Lepidoptera; Pollinator declines; Road ecology,NORTH-AMERICAN; CONSERVATION; DECLINES; BEES; BUTTERFLIES; FLOWERS; VERGES; PLANTS; FLIES; END,"Pollinating insects are vital to the survival of many primary producers in terrestrial ecosystems, as up to 80-85 % of the world's flowering plants require pollinators for reproduction. Over the last few decades however, numerous pollinating insect populations have declined substantially. The causes of these declines are multifaceted and synergistic, and include pesticides, herbicides, monoculture, urbanization, disease, parasites, and climate change. Here, we present evidence for a generally understudied yet potentially significant source of pollinator mortality, collisions with vehicles. Negative impacts from roads have been observed for the majority of vertebrate groups but studies of the effects on invertebrates have remained largely absent from the scientific literature. We documented road mortality of pollinating insects along a 2 km stretch of highway in Ontario, Canada and used our findings to extrapolate expected levels of road mortality across a number of landscape scales. Our extrapolations demonstrate the potential for loss of hundreds of thousands (on our studied highway) to hundreds of billions (generalised across North America) of Lepidopterans, Hymenopterans and pollinating Dipterans each summer. Our projections of such high levels of annual road mortality highlight the need for research to assess whether the mortality levels observed are contributing to the substantial declines of pollinating insects occurring on a global scale, thus putting the ecological functioning of natural areas and agricultural productivity in jeopardy.",2015

Only a small proportion of the diverse fauna of arthropods that can inhabit the orchard ecosystem are important pests, the majority of species being minor pests, beneficial or benign. In this paper, the interacting ecosystem services provided by five contrasting naturally occurring arthropod groups in cool temperate apple orchards are reviewed, and their economic benefits broadly quantified. These are: The roles of bees and other insects in apple pollination increasing yields and fruit quality, the economic value of which may be significantly underestimated. Naturally occurring, pesticide-resistant phytoseiid predatory mites and their role in regulating phytophagous mites. They eliminate the need for 1-2 acaricide sprays per annum and the risk of acaricide resistance. The earwig Forficula auricularia L. and its role in regulating several important apple pests. There is great variability in populations between orchards for reasons not fully understood. It is estimated that F. auricularia reduces insecticide applications by 2-3 per annum and reduces pest damage.

Proper pollination can increase the production and quality of fruit, nut, oil, and fiber crops. We reviewed crop dependence on pollinators and estimated the economic value of pollination per year for each crop in Brazil. We analyzed 141 crops and found that 85 depend on pollinators. Almost one-third of these crops have an essential or great dependence on pollinators. The economic contribution of pollinators totals similar to 30% (similar to US$12 billion) of the total annual agricultural income of the dependent crops (totalizing almost US$45 billion). However, half of these figures includes soybean crop (US$5.7 billion of pollinators' contribution and US$22 billion of annual income). Soybean was considered as having a modest dependence on pollinators, but this remains controversial because pollinator dependence might vary among different varieties cultivated in Brazil. Moreover, we have no information about pollinator dependence regarding some important crops, showing the urgent need for basic research into reproductive biology and pollination ecology.",2015
Ants vs. antlions: An insect model for studying the role of learned and hard-wired behavior in coevolution,Learning in insects; Coevolution; Rescue behavior; Predator vs. prey; Antlions; Ants,PRECISION RESCUE BEHAVIOR; LION LARVAE; PREY; MYRMELEONTIDAE; NEUROPTERA; PREDATOR; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION,"In coevolutionary relationships, such as those between flowering plants and their pollinators, parasites and their hosts, or predators and their prey, each species exerts selection pressures on the other, often resulting in a reciprocal, continually evolving series of adaptations and counter-adaptations. In the predator-prey relationship, for example, faster pursuit in predators leads to more effective strategies to evade capture in their prey, which in turn leads to improved predatory tactics. Although researchers have uncovered many highly specialized behavioral and morphological adaptations in these coevolutionary arms races between predators and their prey, the capacity to learn is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we explore the role of both learned and hard-wired behavior in a predator-prey model of a coevolutionary arms race, namely, predatory larval antlions and one of their prey, sand-dwelling ants. We review research demonstrating multiple ways in which the ability to anticipate prey via associative learning provides clear fitness advantages for antlions. On the other side of this predator-prey relationship, ants that live in the vicinity of predatory antlions have evolved the ability to rescue nestmates from antlion pits. Although it appears that many, perhaps all, ant species have the potential to perform rescue behavior, those species that live in the same ecological niche as antlions are capable of performing highly integrated, precise rescue behavior patterns, targeting what, exactly, has bound their nestmate, whether it be a predatory antlion or some other form of entrapment.

Reproductive character displacement shapes a spatially structured petal color polymorphism in Leavenworthia stylosa,Carotenoids; competition; hybridization; pollination; sympatry,POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; ANNUAL LINANTHUS-PARRYAE; FLOWER-COLOR; NATURAL-SELECTION; FLORAL-COLOR; WILD RADISH; EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; SEED PRODUCTION; MONKEYFLOWERS MIMULUS,"Character displacement is a potentially important process driving trait evolution and species diversification. Floral traits may experience character displacement in response to pollinator-mediated competition (ecological character displacement) or the risk of forming hybrids with reduced fitness (reproductive character displacement). We test these and alternative hypotheses to explain a yellow-white petal color polymorphism in Leavenworthia stylosa, where yellow morphs are spatially associated with a white-petaled congener (Leavenworthia exigua) that produces hybrids with complete pollen sterility. A reciprocal transplant experiment found limited evidence of local adaptation of yellow color morphs via increased survival and seed set. Pollinator observations revealed that Leavenworthia attract various pollinators that generally favor white petals and exhibit color constancy. Pollen limitation experiments showed that yellow petals do not alleviate competition for pollination. Interspecific pollinator movements were infrequent and low hybridization rates (approximate to 0.40-0.85%) were found in each morph, with natural rates likely being lower. Regardless, hybridization rates were significantly higher in white morphs of L. stylosa, yielding a small selection coefficient of s = 0.0042 against this phenotype in sympatry with L. exigua. These results provide support for RCD as a mechanism contributing to the pattern of petal color polymorphism in L. stylosa.",2015
Increasing modularity when downscaling networks from species to individuals,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK; FLOWER-VISITOR NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB COMPLEXITY; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIPARTITE NETWORKS; COMPARTMENTALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; STABILITY,"Downscaling networks from species to individuals is a useful approach to incorporate inter-individual variation and to investigate whether topology of species-based networks results from processes acting at the scale of individuals, such as foraging behaviour. Here, we analyzed pollen-transport networks at two scales, i.e. pollinator species-plant species (sp-sp) and pollinator individuals-plant species (i-sp), and assessed whether modularity - a prevalent pattern in most pollination networks - is consistent across both scales. To test this we use three different algorithms developed for the calculation of modularity (unipartite, bipartite and weighted bipartite modularity) and compare the results obtained. Downscaling networks revealed a higher modular structure in i-sp networks than in sp-sp networks, regardless of the modular metric used. Using a null model approach, we show that modularity at the individual scale is originated by the existence of a high heterogeneity and specialization in the partition of pollen resources among conspecific individuals, a pattern which obviously cannot be observed at the species level. Modules in i-sp networks consisted of individuals sometimes neither taxonomically nor functionally related, but sharing common pollen resources at different moments of the flowering season. Interestingly, conspecific individuals may belong to different modules. Both plant and insect phenologies were important drivers of the modularity detected in individual-based networks, even determining the topological roles of nodes in the networks. A temporal turnover of modules was identified, i.e. modules of individuals assembled and disassembled over time as species modify their foraging choices throughout the flowering season adjusting to ecological conditions. Downscaling from species to individual-based networks is a promising approach to study the interplay among structural patterns and processes at different, but interdependent organizational levels.",2015

In most cases, it is not feasible to observe trophic interactions between predators and prey directly and with the available methods, it is difficult to quantify the connections between them. Here, we show that submicron-sized silica particles (100-150nm) with encapsulated DNA (SPED) enable accurate food and organism labelling and quantification of specific animal-to-animal transfer over more than one trophic level. We found that SPED were readily transferable and quantifiable from the bottom to the top of a two-level food chain of arthropods. SPED were taken up in the gut system and remained persistent in an animal over several days. When uniquely labelled SPED were applied at predefined ratios, we found that information about their relative abundance was reliably conserved after trophic level transfer and over time. SPED were also applied to investigate the flower preference of fly pollinators and proved to be a fast and accurate analysis method. SPED combine attributes of DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis such as unique labelling, quantification via real-time PCR and exact backtracking to the tracer source. This improves and simplifies the analysis and monitoring of ecological networks.",2015
Mortal combat and competition for oviposition sites in female pollinating fig wasps,Agaonidae; contest behavior; female-female; Ficus; intraspecific competition; lethal combat,FIGHTING BEHAVIOR; SEXUAL SELECTION; EVOLUTION; MUTUALISM; CONFLICT; INTERFERENCE; MECHANISMS; CONTESTS; ECOLOGY; LOGIC,"Aggressive contests between animals are common but rarely result in death because the benefits of winning a fight rarely exceed the cost of losing. Lethal combat can evolve, however, when the contested resource translates to much of the future reproductive success of each combatant. Female agaonid fig wasps pollinate and lay their eggs in the flowers within the enclosed inflorescences (""figs"") of fig trees (Ficus spp.). Wasps rarely leave the first fig entered so the reproductive success of each ""foundress"" usually depends on the availability of flowers within a single fig. We report for the first time lethal combat between female agaonids, in the undescribed Pegoscapus sp. that pollinates Ficus citrifolia in southeastern Brazil. In staged dyadic contests, wasps showed no aggression outside or inside the fig until one foundress oviposited. The first wasp to oviposit then became aggressive, which usually resulted in the death of its competitor. Examination of dead foundresses in naturally occurring figs showed that injuring competitors, particularly through decapitation, was effective at reducing their oviposition rates. In a Panamanian F. citrifolia population, pollinated by another wasp species, Pegoscapus tonduzi, there was little aggression between foundresses in similar contests. We suggest that reduced aggression in P. tonduzi reflects less competition for resources essential for successful reproduction due to on average fewer foundresses per flower in Panama.",2015
Semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land: European map and links to ecosystem service supply,Provisioning services; Regulating services; Spectral rule-based image classification; Common Agricultural Policy; Ecological focus areas; European Union biodiversity Strategy,IMAGE UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMS,"Semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land mainly includes extensively managed grasslands, agro-forestry areas and all vegetated features that are not used for crop production, such as hedgerows, buffer strips, field margins and woodlots. Semi-natural vegetation plays a major role in the supply of ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, water quality control and erosion prevention. The efficiency of ecosystem services for agriculture should therefore depend upon the spatial distribution of semi-natural vegetation. In spite of such a relevance, semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land has never been mapped at the European scale. Therefore, we report here the first 1- km resolution map of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land at the European Union scale. For that, we use an innovative convergence-of-evidence mapping method. We also present an assessment and a classification of the relation between semi-natural vegetation and ecosystem service supply at the regional scale. The major improvements in our mapping method are the following: (1) both large and small patches of perennial vegetation are detected in fine-resolution satellite images by incorporating the spectral rule-based preliminary classifier, (2) the identification of semi-natural grassland is enhanced, (3) European ancillary maps are used to help mapping of woody vegetation and identification of agro-ecosystems. Validation shows that our output map is 34.3 % more accurate than pre-existing components. In addition, results show that regulating ecosystem services increase with the abundance of semi-natural vegetation in agricultural lands with a coefficient R (2) of 0.67. The results also show no specific trend in relation to provisioning ecosystem services. These findings mean that semi-natural vegetation is usually beneficial for regulating services, whereas the relation to provisioning services is strictly context-dependent. Overall our study supports greening measures design in the frame of the Common Agricultural Policy for 2014-2020. Results also will help to identify green infrastructure elements and priority areas for ecological restoration.",2015

Native and Non-Native Supergeneralist Bee Species Have Different Effects on Plant-Bee Networks,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; TRIGONA-SPINIPES; HABITAT LOSS; HONEY-BEE; INVASION,"Supergeneralists, defined as species that interact with multiple groups of species in ecological networks, can act as important connectors of otherwise disconnected species subsets. In Brazil, there are two supergeneralist bees: the honeybee Apis mellifera, a non-native species, and Trigona spinipes, a native stingless bee. We compared the role of both species and the effect of geographic and local factors on networks by addressing three questions: 1) Do both species have similar abundance and interaction patterns (degree and strength) in plant-bee networks? 2) Are both species equally influential to the network structure (nestedness, connectance, and plant and bee niche overlap)? 3) How are these species affected by geographic (altitude, temperature, precipitation) and local (natural vs. disturbed habitat) factors? We analyzed 21 plant-bee weighted interaction networks, encompassing most of the main biomes in Brazil. We found no significant difference between both species in abundance, in the number of plant species with which each bee species interacts (degree), and in the sum of their dependencies (strength). Structural equation models revealed the effect of A. mellifera and T. spinipes, respectively, on the interaction network pattern (nestedness) and in the similarity in bee's interactive partners (bee niche overlap). It is most likely that the recent invasion of A. mellifera resulted in its rapid settlement inside the core of species that retain the largest number of interactions, resulting in a strong influence on nestedness. However, the long-term interaction between native T. spinipes and other bees most likely has a more direct effect on their interactive behavior. Moreover, temperature negatively affected A. mellifera bees, whereas disturbed habitats positively affected T. spinipes. Conversely, precipitation showed no effect. Being positively (T. spinipes) or indifferently (A. mellifera) affected by disturbed habitats makes these species prone to pollinate plant species in these areas, which are potentially poor in pollinators.",2015

Despite the fact that transformed habitats are becoming more common and constitute a major biodiversity change driver, little is known about the scale-dependent responses of plant-animal mutualisms. Aiming to test the multiscale responses of pollination and seed dispersal in a habitat transformation scenario, we examined a gradient of native and transformed habitats at three spatial scales (0-50, 50-100 and 100-250m) and focused on a highly specialized mutualistic system composed of a hemiparasitic mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus) that is almost exclusively pollinated by a hummingbird (Sephanoides sephaniodes) and dispersed by an arboreal marsupial (Dromiciops gliroides). Even though mistletoes were found along the gradient, they were more abundant and more densely aggregated when the transformed habitat was dominant. Disperser and pollinator activity also increased as the transformed habitat becomes dominant, at the scale of 0-50 and 50-100m, respectively. Furthermore, crop size and disperser activity covaried at broad and intermediate scales, whereas recruitment covaried at intermediate and fine scales. Moreover, disperser activity and the number of seedlings were spatially associated, stressing D.gliroides' role in the recruitment of the mistletoe.Synthesis. This highly specialized mutualistic system seems to be responding positively to the habitat structure modifications associated with Eucalyptus plantations. However, the actual costs (e.g. reduced gene flow, increased herbivory) in these transformed habitats are yet to be assessed.",2015

We induced three to five levels of reproductive effort (RE) by manipulating fruit set of a long-lived orchid in two populations that differed in the length of the growing season and local climate and examined survival, size and fecundity the following year. Natural fruit set was 72% higher in the long-season population, but was not associated with a significant survival cost in any population. Survival decreased linearly with experimentally increased RE in the short-season population. In both populations, natural RE incurred growth and fecundity costs, and growth costs increased nonlinearly with diminishing costs at high RE. Fecundity costs increased linearly with RE in the long-season population, but nonlinearly with diminishing costs at high RE in the other. The results demonstrate that the shape of the cost function may be nonlinear with context-dependent intercept, slope and curvature. They are consistent with the prediction that survival costs appear only when RE exceeds natural levels, while growth and fecundity costs are evident at natural RE.Synthesis. We suggest that studies inducing multiple levels of RE are required to understand life-history trade-offs and their context dependence. This kind of information is fundamental for an understanding of the link between environmental heterogeneity, adaptive differentiation and life-history evolution.",2015

Despite substantial recent progress, ecologists continue to search for methods of measuring the structure of ecological networks. Several studies have focused on nestedness, a pattern reflecting the tendency of network nodes to share interaction partners. Here, we introduce a new statistical procedure to measure both this kind of structure and the opposite one (i.e. species' tendency against sharing interacting partners) that we call node segregation'. In addition, our procedure provides also a straightforward measure of modularity, that is, the tendency of a network to be compartmented into separated clusters of interacting nodes. 2. This new analytical measure of network structure assesses the average deviation between the observed number of neighbours shared by any pair of nodes (species), and the expected number, that is computed using a probabilistic approach based on simple combinatorics. The measure can be applied to both bipartite networks (such as plant-pollinators) and unimode networks (such as food webs). We tested our approach on several sets of hypothetical and real-world networks. 3. We demonstrate that our approach makes it possible to identify different kinds of non-random network configurations (nestedness, node segregation and modularity). In addition, we show that nestedness in ecological networks is less common than previously thought, and that most ecological networks (including the majority of mutualistic ones) tend towards patterns of segregated associations. 4.Our analyses show that the new measure of node overlap and segregation can efficiently identify different structural patterns. The results of our analyses conducted on real networks highlight the need to carefully reconsider the assumption that ecological networks are stable due to their inherent nestedness.",2015

These collective seed releases, termed masts', are thought to be a strategy to overwhelm seed predators or to maximise pollination rates. But why are the intervals so long, and how did they evolve? We propose a simple mathematical model that supports their evolution as a two-step process: First, an initial phase in which a mostly annually flowering population synchronises onto a small multi-year interval. Second, a phase of successive small multiplications of the initial synchronisation interval, resulting in the extraordinary intervals seen today. A prediction of the hypothesis is that mast intervals observed today should factorise into small prime numbers. Using a historical data set of bamboo flowering observations, we find strong evidence in favour of this prediction. Our hypothesis provides the first theoretical explanation for the mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon.",2015

Insects and other arthropods provide ideal model systems to study how intraspecific behavioral variation affects phenomena in ecology. This is due to the fact that arthropods not only are highly amenable to experimental manipulation, but they also allow us to answer general ecological questions on multiple scales of biological organization. Herein, we review recent developments and views on how the framework of animal personality could provide a deeper understanding of classic issues in (1) population ecology (e.g., local adaptation, dispersal, and invasion), (2) community ecology (e.g., food webs and ecosystem engineering), and (3) more insect-focused topics such as metamorphosis and pollination biology.",2015

Previous recommendations for developing or enhancing these programmes focus either on the end goals, that is the intended use of the data, or on how these goals are achieved, for example through volunteer involvement in citizen science, but not both. These recommendations are rarely prioritized. We used a collaborative approach, involving 52 experts in biodiversity monitoring in the UK, to develop a list of attributes of relevance to any biodiversity monitoring programme and to order these attributes by their priority. We also ranked the attributes according to their importance in monitoring biodiversity in the UK. Experts involved included data users, funders, programme organizers and participants in data collection. They covered expertise in a wide range of taxa. We developed a final list of 25 attributes of biodiversity monitoring schemes, ordered from the most elemental (those essential for monitoring schemes; e.g. articulate the objectives and gain sufficient participants) to the most aspirational (e.g. electronic data capture in the field, reporting change annually). This ordered list is a practical framework which can be used to support the development of monitoring programmes. People's ranking of attributes revealed a difference between those who considered attributes with benefits to end users to be most important (e.g. people from governmental organizations) and those who considered attributes with greatest benefit to participants to be most important (e.g. people involved with volunteer biological recording schemes). This reveals a distinction between focussing on aims and the pragmatism in achieving those aims.Synthesis and applications. The ordered list of attributes developed in this study will assist in prioritizing resources to develop biodiversity monitoring programmes (including citizen science). The potential conflict between end users of data and participants in data collection that we discovered should be addressed by involving the diversity of stakeholders at all stages of programme development. This will maximize the chance of successfully achieving the goals of biodiversity monitoring programmes.

Microbial communities on flower surfaces act as signatures of pollinator visitation,,BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; FLORAL NECTAR; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; SCALE; PLANT; SKIN,"Microbes are easily dispersed from one place to another, and immigrant microbes might contain information about the environments from which they came. We hypothesized that part of the microbial community on a flower's surface is transferred there from insect body surfaces and that this community can provide information to identify potential pollinator insects of that plant. We collected insect samples from the field, and found that an insect individual harbored an average of 12.2 x 10(5) microbial cells on its surface. A laboratory experiment showed that the microbial community composition on a flower surface changed after contact with an insect, suggesting that microbes are transferred from the insect to the flower. Comparison of the microbial fingerprint approach and direct visual observation under field condition suggested that the microbial community on a flower surface could to some extent indicate the structure of plant-pollinator interactions. In conclusion, species-specific insect microbial communities specific to insect species can be transferred from an insect body to a flower surface, and these microbes can serve as a ""fingerprint"" of the insect species, especially for large-bodied insects. Dispersal of microbes is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has unexpected and novel applications in many fields and disciplines.",2015
Ranking species in mutualistic networks,,FOOD WEBS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; RAIN-FOREST; BIRDS; ROBUSTNESS; BIOLOGY; FRUIT; CONNECTANCE,"Understanding the architectural subtleties of ecological networks, believed to confer them enhanced stability and robustness, is a subject of outmost relevance. Mutualistic interactions have been profusely studied and their corresponding bipartite networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, have been reported to exhibit a characteristic ""nested"" structure. Assessing the importance of any given species in mutualistic networks is a key task when evaluating extinction risks and possible cascade effects. Inspired in a recently introduced algorithm -similar in spirit to Google's PageRank but with a built-in non-linearity-here we propose a method which -by exploiting their nested architecture-allows us to derive a sound ranking of species importance in mutualistic networks. This method clearly outperforms other existing ranking schemes and can become very useful for ecosystem management and biodiversity preservation, where decisions on what aspects of ecosystems to explicitly protect need to be made.",2015

However, our knowledge of ecological network architecture in the wild largely stems from empirical studies on macro-organismal systems such as those of plant-pollinator, plant-seed disperser, and prey-predator interactions. In this sense, we have remained ignorant of the diversity of ecological network architecture, its underlying assembly processes, and its consequences on ecological and coevolutionary dynamics. In this paper, I discuss how the high-throughput DNA barcoding of microbes, especially that based on next-generation sequencing, potentially expands the target of ecological network studies. I review the methodological platforms of next-generation sequencing-based analyses of microbe-host animal/plant networks and then introduce some case studies on the networks of plants and their hyper-diverse fungal symbionts. As those preliminary studies are uncovering the unexpected diversity of ecological network architecture, further application of such next-generation sequencing-based analyses to a diverse array of microbial systems will significantly improve our views on community ecological and coevolutionary processes.",2015

Ants establish mutualistic interactions involving a wide range of protective relationships (myrmecophily), in which they provide defence against enemies and partners provide food rewards and/or refuge. Although similar in the general outcome, myrmecophilic interactions differ in some characteristics such as quantity and quality of rewards offered by partners which may lead to different specialisation levels and, consequently, to different network properties. 2. The aim of this study was to identify structural patterns in myrmecophilic interaction networks, focusing on aspects related to specialisation: network modularity, nestedness and taxonomic relatedness of interaction ranges. To achieve this, a database of networks was compiled, including the following interactions: ants and domatia-bearing plants (myrmecophytes); ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants (EFNs); ants and floral nectary-bearing plants (FNs); ants and Lepidoptera caterpillars; and ants and Hemiptera. 3. Myrmecophilic networks differed in their topology, with ant-myrmecophyte and ant-Lepidoptera networks being similar in their structural properties. A continuum was found, ranging from highly modular networks and phylogenetically structured interaction ranges in ant-myrmecophyte followed by ant-Lepidoptera networks to low modularity and taxonomically unrelated interaction ranges in ant-Hemiptera, EFN and FN networks. 4. These results suggest that different network topologies may be found across communities of species with similar interaction types, but also, that similar network topologies can be achieved through different mechanisms such as those between ants and myrmecophytes or Lepidoptera larvae. This study contributes to a generalisation of myrmecophilic network patterns and a better understanding of the relationship between specialisation and network topology.",2015
Adaptive rewiring aggravates the effects of species loss in ecosystems,,FOOD WEBS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; CASCADING EXTINCTIONS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; TROPHIC LEVEL; SEA OTTERS; BODY-SIZE; STABILITY; BIODIVERSITY,"Loss of one species in an ecosystem can trigger extinctions of other dependent species. For instance, specialist predators will go extinct following the loss of their only prey unless they can change their diet. It has therefore been suggested that an ability of consumers to rewire to novel prey should mitigate the consequences of species loss by reducing the risk of cascading extinction. Using a new modelling approach on natural and computer-generated food webs we find that, on the contrary, rewiring often aggravates the effects of species loss. This is because rewiring can lead to overexploitation of resources, which eventually causes extinction cascades. Such a scenario is particularly likely if prey species cannot escape predation when rare and if predators are efficient in exploiting novel prey. Indeed, rewiring is a two-edged sword; it might be advantageous for individual predators in the short term, yet harmful for long-term system persistence.",2015

Given the environmental, economic and social value of urban agriculture, it is important to understand the ecosystem services that sustain it. We experimentally investigated how pollination by wild bees affects tomato production on 16 urban agriculture sites in San Francisco, CA. By comparing four pollination service indicators (fruit set, fruit mass, yield, and seed set) in four pollination treatments (open, artificial-self, artificial-cross, control), we were able to determine that tomatoes pollinated by wild bees significantly outperform the control in terms of all four pollination service indicators measured. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that urban areas can support adequate pollination service to urban agriculture, regardless of garden size, garden age, or proportion of impervious surface in the surrounding matrix, and that floral resource density is a major factor influencing pollination service.",2015

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT(50)s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival. These findings challenge the common perception of non-target safety of reduced-risk insecticides and bioinsecticides, particularly regarding native pollinator species.",2015

Animal-pollinated crops grown today, bred in an environment where pollination was less likely to limit fruit set, are often suboptimal in attracting and sustaining their pollinator populations. Research into plant pollinator interactions is often conducted in a curiosity-driven, ecological framework, but may inform breeding and biotechnological approaches to enhance pollinator attraction and crop yield.

Their negative impacts in Africa are extensive and call for a renewed commitment to better understand the correlates of invasion success. Here, we explored several putative drivers of species invasion among woody non-native trees and shrubs in southern Africa, a region of high floristic diversity. We tested for differences in functional traits between plant categories using a combination of phylogenetic independent contrasts and a simulation-based phylogenetic anova. We found that non-native species generally have longer flowering duration compared with native species and are generally hermaphroditic, and their dispersal is mostly abiotically mediated. We also revealed that non-native trees and shrubs that have become invasive are less closely related to native trees and shrubs than their non-invasive non-native counterparts. Non-natives that are more closely related to the native species pool may be more likely to possess traits suited to the new environment in which they find themselves and thus have greater chance of establishment. However, successful invaders are less closely related to the native pool, indicating evidence for competitive release or support for the vacant niche theory.Synthesis. Non-native trees and shrubs in southern Africa are characterized by a suite of traits, including long flowering times, a hermaphroditic sexual system and abiotic dispersal, which may represent important adaptations promoting establishment. We suggest that differences in the evolutionary distances separating the native species pool from invasive and non-invasive species might help resolve Darwin's naturalization conundrum.",2015
What Can Interaction Webs Tell Us About Species Roles?,,FOOD-WEB; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; COMMUNITIES; HERBIVORES; DIVERSITY; PARASITES; DYNAMICS; STRENGTH; POLLINATORS,"The group model is a useful tool to understand broad-scale patterns of interaction in a network, but it has previously been limited in use to food webs, which contain only predatorprey interactions. Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/ 0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.",2015

Advances in comparative methods along with larger phylogenies for floral radiations off er new opportunities for investigating the macroevolution of flower color. METHODS: We examined the tempo and mode of flower color evolution in four clades (Antirrhineae, Iochrominae, Loeselieae, Quamoclit) using models that incorporate trait transitions and lineage diversification. Focusing on floral anthocyanin pigmentation, we estimated rates of gain and loss of pigmentation and tested whether these changes occur predominantly through anagenesis or cladogenesis. KEY RESULTS: We found that the tempo of pigment gains and losses varied significantly across the clades and that the rates of change were often asymmetrical, favoring gains over losses. The mode of color shifts tended to be cladogenetic, particularly for gains of color; however, this trend was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Given that all flowering plants share the same pathway for producing anthocyanins, the marked variation in the tempo of transitions across the four groups suggests differences in the selective forces acting on floral pigmentation. These ecological and physiological factors, together with genetic basis for color, may also explain the bias toward gains of floral anthocyanins. Estimates for cladogenetic and anagenetic rates suggest that color transitions can occur through both modes, although testing their relative importance will require larger datasets.",2015
Spatial Heterogeneity Regulates Plant-Pollinator Networks across Multiple Landscape Scales,,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; HABITAT LOSS; HONEY-BEE; BIODIVERSITY; AGROECOSYSTEMS; NESTEDNESS; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; CROPS,"Mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions play a key role in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning. In a community, the combination of these interactions can generate emergent properties, e.g., robustness and resilience to disturbances such as fluctuations in populations and extinctions. Given that these systems are hierarchical and complex, environmental changes must have multiple levels of influence. In addition, changes in habitat quality and in the landscape structure are important threats to plants, pollinators and their interactions. However, despite the importance of these phenomena for the understanding of biological systems, as well as for conservation and management strategies, few studies have empirically evaluated these effects at the network level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of local conditions and landscape structure at multiple scales on the characteristics of plant-pollinator networks. This study was conducted in agri-natural lands in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. Pollinators were collected in 27 sampling units distributed orthogonally along a gradient of proportion of agriculture and landscape diversity. The Akaike information criterion was used to select models that best fit the metrics for network characteristics, comparing four hypotheses represented by a set of a priori candidate models with specific combinations of the proportion of agriculture, the average shape of the landscape elements, the diversity of the landscape and the structure of local vegetation. The results indicate that a reduction of habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity can cause species loss and decrease of networks nestedness. These structural changes can reduce robustness and resilience of plant-pollinator networks what compromises the reproductive success of plants, the maintenance of biodiversity and the pollination service stability. We also discuss the possible explanations for these relationships and the implications for landscape planning in agricultural areas.",2015

In the present paper, we studied flower volatiles of sapromyiophilous Periploca laevigata and their capability to elicit biological responses in one of the pollinator species, Musca domestica. Floral volatiles were collected by dynamic headspace and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and electrophysiological (GC/EAD) and behavioral assays (two choice olfactometer) were conducted. In the floral scent of P. laevigata, we detected 44 compounds, of which indole, beta-caryophyllene, and germacrene D, as well as dimethyl trisulfide, which was present in trace amounts, were electrophysiologically active in the antennae of M. domestica. However, when we evaluated in behavioral experiments the attractiveness of the electrophysiologically active compounds (complete mixture against partial mixtures or against single compounds), we found that indole was the only attractive compound for the flies.",2015

Climate models consistently predict widespread warmer and drier conditions by the end of the 21st century. As a consequence, water stress will increase throughout the region. We here review current understanding of the impact of climate change on forests' distribution patterns, species diversity and ecosystem functioning of lowland rainforests in the Amazon basin. We reviewed 192 studies that provide empirical evidence, historical information and theoretical models. Over millions of years rainforests expansions and contractions have been accompanied by changes in the diversity and productivity of forests. In the future, drought will produce forest contractions along the forest edges and the savanna ecotone, causing an extensive savannization, particularly in the east. In terms of diversity, warming will reduce plant species survival by decreasing their productivity, but extinctions may also occur as a result of vegetation disequilibrium, as many plants, dispersal and pollinator species will fail to track changing climate; mild drought kills understory trees and severe drought may eliminate canopy trees as well. Severe droughts will thus produce directional changes in species composition, although these shifts may vary among forests on different soil types. In terms of ecosystem functioning, droughts will reduce root growth and standing biomass and may shift the Amazonian forest from being CO2 sinks to become CO2 sources. Physiological and ecological responses to warming and the feedback between vegetation and climate are still not completely understood. In particular, experimental assays that allow direct conclusions on the response of Amazonian plants to the predicted climatic conditions are needed. Such studies could make possible more reliable estimates of future climatic and vegetation responses.",2015

Thus, evaluating the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages to species loss is a major concern. How species interaction patterns are related to species sensitivity to partner loss may influence the robustness of plant-pollinator assemblages. In plants, both reproductive dependence on pollinators (breeding system) and dispersal ability may modulate plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. For instance, species with strong dependence (e.g. dioecious species) and low dispersal (e.g. seeds dispersed by gravity) may be the most sensitive to pollinator loss. We compared the interaction patterns of plants differing in dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability in a meta-dataset comprising 192 plant species from 13 plant-pollinator networks. In addition, network robustness was compared under different scenarios representing sequences of plant extinctions associated with plant sensitivity to pollinator loss. Species with different dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability showed similar levels of generalization. Although plants with low dispersal ability interacted with more generalized pollinators, low-dispersal plants with strong dependence on pollinators (i.e. the most sensitive to pollinator loss) interacted with more particular sets of pollinators (i.e. shared a low proportion of pollinators with other plants). Only two assemblages showed lower robustness under the scenario considering plant generalization, dependence on pollinators and dispersal ability than under the scenario where extinction sequences only depended on plant generalization (i.e. where higher generalization level was associated with lower probability of extinction). Overall, our results support the idea that species generalization and network topology may be good predictors of assemblage robustness to species loss, independently of plant dispersal ability and breeding system. In contrast, since ecological specialization among partners may increase the probability of disruption of interactions, the fact that the plants most sensitive to pollinator loss interacted with more particular pollinator assemblages suggest that the persistence of these plants and their pollinators might be highly compromised.",2015

Although reciprocal herkogamy and associated floral traits are generally thought to be discrete and strict polymorphisms, little is known about variation in floral traits related to the distylous syndrome within and among populations of a single species. In this study, variation in floral morphology and reciprocal positioning of the sexual organs in the distylous Primula veris (cowslip) is quantified. Methods Data were collected in ten populations occurring in two contrasting habitat types (grasslands and forests), and for each population the average level of reciprocity was assessed, the strength of the self-incompatibility system was determined, and seed production under natural conditions was quantified. Results In grassland populations, flowers showed clear distyly with low and symmetric reciprocity indices at both the lower and upper level. In forests, P. veris produced larger flowers that showed strong deviations in stigma-anther separation, especially in the L-morph. This deviation was mainly driven by variation in stigma height, resulting in high and asymmetric reciprocity indices and the occurrence of several short-styled homostylous plants. Self-incompatibility was, however, strict in both habitats, and morph ratios did not differ significantly from isoplethy. The observed shift in reciprocity in forest populations was associated with a significant reduction in seed production in the L-morph. Conclusions The results indicate that populations of P. veris show habitat-specific variation in flower morphology. Deviations from perfect reciprocal positioning of stigmas and anthers also translate into reduced seed production, suggesting that small changes in sexual organ reciprocity can have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.",2015

It has recently emerged that some of these mutualistic associations have, however, evolved towards other forms of relationships and, in particular, that plants may manipulate their partner ants to make reciprocation more beneficial, thereby stabilizing the mutualism. Focusing on plants bearing extrafloral nectaries, we review recent studies and address three key questions: (i) how can plants attract potential partners and maintain their services; (ii) are there compounds in extrafloral nectar that could mediate partner manipulation; and (iii) are ants susceptible to such compounds? After reviewing the current knowledge on plant-ant associations, we propose a possible scenario where plant-derived chemicals, such as secondary metabolites, known to have an impact on animal brain, could have evolved in plants to attract and manipulate ant behaviour. This new viewpoint would place plant-animal interaction in a different ecological context, opening new ecological and neurobiological perspectives of drug seeking and use.",2015

We studied the flowering phenology, breeding systems and florivory in a community of seven epiphytic Tillandsia spp. in a tropical dry forest in central Mexico. Flowering periods were distributed throughout the year, and corolla sizes suggested that most species share pollinators. The most common breeding system was self-incompatibility (Tillandsia achyrostachys, T.caput-medusae and T.hubertiana), T.lydiae was infertile, T.circinnatioides was partially self-compatible and T.recurvata and T.schiedeana were self-compatible with high autonomous self-pollination. Floral morphology suggests that delayed selfing occurs in the autonomous self-pollinated species, and separation between stigma and stamens could result in self-pollination in the remaining species being avoided. Less than 5% of the inflorescences in the most abundant species (T.recurvata) suffered damage by florivores, but >40% of inflorescences were damaged in the other species. In damaged inflorescences, fruit set decreased by up to 89%. Our data show that the dominant species (T.recurvata) is autogamous and its reproductive success is slightly reduced by resource constraints and florivory. In the less abundant species, resource limitation and florivory dramatically reduced reproductive success, but the strength of these limiting factors is season dependent.",2015

Developing a framework for the diversity of signals has important consequences for understanding alternative models of sexual selection and the processes contributing to speciation. In this article we review how models of neutral evolution in the perceptual space of signal perceivers provide a first step toward constructing a framework for signal diversity. We discuss how the distinction between additive and multiplicative effects of multimodal signaling represents a second step. We then assess how signal efficiency, reliability, and the aesthetics of perceivers provide distinct mechanisms for signals to be effective, thereby partly explaining signal diversity. Understanding the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the effectiveness of mate choice signals unravels the relative importance of alternative models of sexual selection. It can also help to distinguish whether divergence of communication is a driver or a consequence of speciation. Throughout the review we emphasize the importance of verification and learning in repeated interactions for understanding variation in signals.",2015

Such selection may be particularly potent for seed production in flowering plants, as they often experience variation in pollen receipt among individuals and among flowers within individuals. Using analytically tractable models, we examine the optimal allocations for producing ovules, attracting pollen, and maturing seeds in deterministic and stochastic pollen environments. In deterministic environments, the optimal strategy attracts sufficient pollen to fertilize every ovule and mature every zygote into a seed. Stochastic environments select for allocations proportional to the risk of seed production being limited by zygotes or seed maturation. When producing an ovule is cheap and maturing a seed is expensive, among-plant variation selects for attracting more pollen at the expense of producing fewer ovules and having fewer resources for seed maturation. Despite this increased allocation, such populations are likely to be pollen limited. In contrast, within-plant variation generally selects for an overproduction of ovules and, to a lesser extent, pollen attraction. Such populations are likely to be resource limited and exhibit low seed-to-ovule ratios. These results highlight the importance of multiscale variation in the evolution and ecology of resource allocations.",2015
Towards a more holistic research approach to plant conservation: the case of rare plants on oceanic islands,Azores; conservation; germination; population genetics; species distribution models; threats; Veronica dabneyi,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; TREE PICCONIA-AZORICA; NICHE FACTOR-ANALYSIS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SEED-GERMINATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; ENDANGERED PLANT; INVASIVE WEED; ENDEMIC PLANT,"Research dedicated to rare endemic plants is usually focused on one given aspect. However, holistic studies, addressing several key issues, might be more useful, supporting management programmes while unravelling basic knowledge about ecological and population-level processes. A more comprehensive approach to research is proposed, encompassing: phylogenetics/systematics, pollination biology and seed dispersal, propagation, population genetics, species distribution models (SDMs), threats and monitoring. We present a holistic study dedicated to Veronica dabneyi Hochst. ex Seub., an endangered chamaephyte endemic to the Azores. Veronica dabneyi was mainly found associated with other endemic taxa; however, invasive plants were also present and together with introduced cattle, goats and rabbits are a major threat. Most populations grow at somewhat rocky and steep locations that appeared to work as refuges. Seed set in the wild was generally high and recruitment of young plants from seed seemed to be frequent. In the laboratory, it was possible to germinate and fully develop V. dabneyi seedlings, which were planted at their site of origin. No dormancy was detected and time for 50 % germination was affected by incubation temperature. Eight new microsatellite markers were applied to 72 individuals from 7 sites. A considerable degree of admixture was found between samples from the two islands Flores and Corvo, with 98 % of the genetic variability allocated within populations. Levels of heterozygosity were high and no evidence of inbreeding was found. Species distribution models based on climatic and topographic variables allowed the estimation of the potential distribution of V. dabneyi on Flores and Corvo using ecological niche factor analysis and Maxent. The inclusion of land-use variables only slightly increased the information explained by the models. Projection of the expected habitat in Faial largely coincided with the only historic record of V. dabneyi on that island. This research could be the basis for the design of a recovery plan, showing the pertinence of more holistic research approaches to plant conservation.",2015
Postzygotic barriers isolate sympatric species of Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) in Hawaiian montane forest understories,angiosperms; cross-fertility; hand pollinations; Hawaii; hybridization; islands; reproductive isolation; species boundaries,REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; PLANT RADIATIONS; GENE-FLOW; EVOLUTION; STRENGTH; HYBRIDS; POLLEN; ORIGIN,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Recent reviews of reproductive isolation (RI) in plants propose that boundaries between closely related species are maintained predominantly through prezygotic mechanisms. However, few experimental studies have explored how boundaries are maintained in long-lived species. Hawaiian Cyrtandra presents an intriguing challenge to our understanding of RI, as it comprises 60 shrub or small tree species that are almost exclusively restricted to wet forests, where sympatry of multiple species is common. METHODS: We assessed the relative strengths of pre- and postzygotic barriers among four species of Cyrtandra occurring at the extremes of the main Hawaiian Island's natural island-age gradient, Kaua'i (4.7 Myr) and Hawai'i Island (0.6 Myr), to contrast the strengths and stages of reproductive isolation among species at different stages of divergence. KEY RESULTS: A combination of F-1 seed germination, F-1 seedling survival, and F-1 seedling growth isolated (61-91%) three of the species from sympatric relatives. In contrast, the fourth species was isolated (59%) from its sympatric relative through phenological differences alone. Significant postzygotic barriers in between-island crosses were also observed in one species. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that boundaries between sympatric Cyrtandra species in Hawaii are maintained predominantly through postzygotic barriers. Observations from between-island crosses indicate that postzygotic barriers can arise in allopatry, which may be important in the initial divergence of populations. Future studies of RI in Cyrtandra should include a broader range of species to determine if postzygotic isolating barriers are foremost in the maintenance of species boundaries in this large genus.",2015
Range increase of a Neotropical orchid bee under future scenarios of climate change,Amazon; Brazil; Climate change; Euglossini; Deforestation; Species distribution models,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; SAMPLING BIAS; CONSERVATION BIOGEOGRAPHY; FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; FAUNA HYMENOPTERA; POTENTIAL IMPACT,"Along with other human impacts, climate change is an important driver of biological changes worldwide and is expected to severely affect species distributions. Although dramatic range shifts and contractions are predicted for many taxa occurring at higher latitudes, including bumble bees, the response of widespread tropical species is less clear due in part to scarcity of reliable occurrence data. Newly mobilized specimen records and improved species distribution models facilitate more robust assessment of future climate effects under various scenarios. Here, we predict both current and future distribution of the orchid bee Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, 1841 (Apidae: Euglossinae), a large-bodied species widely distributed in the Neotropics whose populations within the Amazon region are believed to be controlled by cleptoparasitic Euglossini bees, such as Exaerete smaragdina Gu,rin-Men,ville, 1844 and Aglae caerulea Lepeletier and Serville, 1825. Under both current and future scenarios of climate change, El. nigrita is expected to persist in deforested areas including those that might suffer desertification. While under current climatic conditions this species is not expected to occur in central Amazonia where the forest is still conserved, its range is expected to increase under future scenarios of climate change, especially in areas corresponding to the arc of deforestation in eastern Amazonia. The increase of human-related disturbances in this biome, as well as changes in the relationship of El. nigrita-Ex. smaragdina and El. nigrita-A. caerulea may explain the potential range increase of El. nigrita under future scenarios of climate change.",2015
The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation,Sting extension response; SER; Olfactory learning; Classical conditioning; Pesticides; Xenobiotic; Apis mellifera; Bee health,STING EXTENSION REFLEX; APIS-MELLIFERA; PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; CRAB SPIDERS; FLORAL SCENT; EXPOSURE; MEMORY; POLLINATORS; PESTICIDES; BEHAVIOR,"Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 mu g l(-1) = 20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 mu g per bee day(-1)), significantly impaired aversive short-term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships.",2015
Colony and individual life-history responses to temperature in a social insect pollinator,bumblebees; climate change; colony cycle; phenology; pollination; thermoregulation,TERRESTRIS L. HYMENOPTERA; DIVISION-OF-LABOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUMBLEBEE COLONIES; SEX-RATIOS; APIDAE; LONGEVITY; PHENOLOGY; BEES; THERMOREGULATION,"Pollinating insects are of major ecological and commercial importance, yet they may be facing ecological disruption from a changing climate. Despite this threat, few studies have investigated the life-history responses of pollinators to experimentally controlled changes in temperature, which should be especially informative for species with complex life histories such as eusocial insects. This study uses the key pollinator Bombus terrestris, a eusocial bumblebee with an annual colony cycle, to determine how temperature affects life-history traits at both individual and colony levels. In two laboratory experiments, we reared B.terrestris colonies at either 20 or 25 degrees C, and measured differences in a set of life-history traits including colony longevity, queen longevity, worker longevity, production of workers, production of sexuals (queen and male production) and growth schedule, as well as effects on thermoregulatory behaviours. Higher rearing temperature had a significant positive effect on colony longevity in one of the two experiments but no significant effects on queen or worker longevity. Higher rearing temperature significantly increased colony size but did not affect the timing of peak colony size. It was also associated with significantly higher queen production but had no effect on the production of workers or males or the timing of male production. Higher temperature colonies exhibited significantly more wing fanning by workers and significantly less wax canopy construction. Hence, an increase in rearing temperature of a few degrees increased colony longevity, colony size and queen production. However, individual longevity was not affected and so may have been buffered by changes in costly thermoregulatory behaviours. We conclude that eusocial insects may show complex phenotypic responses to projected temperature increases under climate change, including effects on productivity and reproduction at the colony level. Such effects should be considered when predicting the impact of climate change on the provision of essential pollination services.",2015

In this context, the presence and form of floral nectaries can play a crucial role in driving floral evolution and diversity in flowering plants. However, the reconstruction of the ancestral state of nectary form is often hampered by a lack of anatomical studies and well-resolved phylogenetic trees. Here, we studied 39 differentially pollinated Pedicularis spp., a genus with pronounced interspecific variation in colour, shape and size of the corolla. Anatomical and scanning electron microscopy observations revealed two nectary forms [bulged (N=27) or elongated (N=5)] or the absence of nectaries (N=7). In a phylogenetic context, our data suggest that: (1) the bulged nectary should be the ancestral state; (2) nectaries were independently lost in some beaked species; and (3) elongated nectaries evolved independently in some clades of beakless species. Phylogenetic path analysis showed that nectary presence is indirectly correlated with beak length/pollinator behaviour through an intermediate factor, nectar production. No significant correlation was found between nectary type and nectar production, beak length or pollinator behaviour. Some beaked species had nectary structures, although they did not produce nectar. The nectary in beaked species may be a vestigial structure retained during a recent rapid radiation of Pedicularis, especially in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains of south-western China.",2015
Hybridization and reproductive isolation between diploid Erythronium mesochoreum and its tetraploid congener E-albidum (Liliaceae),Flow cytometry; geographic isolation; pollinator-mediated isolation; polyploidy; reproductive barriers; speciation,CHAMERION-ANGUSTIFOLIUM ONAGRACEAE; MIXED-PLOIDY POPULATIONS; FLOWERING PLANTS; POLYPLOID PLANTS; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; SELF-FERTILIZATION; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY; SIZE,"Polyploidy has played an important role in angiosperm diversification, but how polyploidy contributes to reproductive isolation remains poorly understood. Most work has focused on postzygotic reproductive barriers, and the influence of ploidy differences on prezygotic barriers is understudied. To address these gaps, we quantified hybrid occurrence, interspecific self-compatibility differences, and the contributions of multiple pre- and postzygotic barriers to reproductive isolation between diploid Erythronium mesochoreum (Liliaceae) and its tetraploid congener Erythronium albidum. Reproductive isolation between the study species was nearly complete, and naturally occurring hybrids were infrequent and largely sterile. Although postzygotic barriers effected substantial reproductive isolation when considered in isolation, the study species' spatial distributions and pollinator assemblages overlapped little, such that interspecific pollen transfer is likely uncommon. We did not find evidence that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum differed in mating systems, indicating that self-incompatibility release may not have fostered speciation in this system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that E. albidum and E. mesochoreum are reproductively isolated by multiple, hierarchically-operating barriers, and we add to the currently limited number of studies demonstrating that early acting barriers such as pollinator-mediated isolation can be important for effecting and sustaining reproductive isolation in diploid-polyploid systems.",2015

Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.",2015
"Floral sex allocation and reproductive success within inflorescences of Hosta ventricosa, a pseudogamous apomict",Hosta ventricosa; pollen limitation; pollen-ovule ratio; pseudogamous apomict; resource limitation; within inflorescences,RESOURCE LIMITATION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; SEED SET; FLOWERS; POLLEN; LILIACEAE; PATTERNS; FRUIT; RANUNCULACEAE,"Aims Within inflorescences of sexually reproducing hermaphrodites, the production of ovules, fruits and seeds commonly declines from basal (early-opening) to distal (late-opening) flowers, while pollen production remains constant or only changes slightly, with the result that distal (late-opening) flowers become functionally male. However, few empirical studies have specifically examined whether or not changes in allocation to pollen production actually lead to changes in the number of seeds sired, a more direct measure of male fitness. In pseudogamous apomicts, fitness depends on the number of seeds produced; thus, a contrasting pattern of variation in the pollen-to-ovule (P/O) ratio within inflorescences might be expected. Methods We investigated floral sex allocation and reproductive success within racemes of Hosta ventricosa, a pseudogamous apomictic hermaphrodite possessing flowers that open acropetally. We quantified variations in pollen number, ovule number, the P/O ratio and fruit and seed production, from 2007 to 2011, among flowers within racemes of four populations of H. ventricosa in southwest China. Ecological causes for fruit and seed production were evaluated by observing patterns of pollen deposition, flower removal and supplemental pollination. Important Findings Pollen number, ovule number and the P/O ratio declined from basal-to-distal positions in all sampled populations (years). Fruit and seed production decreased distally in most populations (years). Low fruit and seed set of distal flowers was not due to pollen limitation because pollen deposition never declined distally and the low fruit and seed set of distal flowers remained even after supplementary pollination was provided. The flower-removal experiment indicated that inter-fruit competition for resources among flowers was common. The low P/O ratio of distal flowers in H. ventricosa might be favored because they were unable to obtain fitness by donating pollen and siring seeds on other plants. Our study may help to understand the adaptive significance of sex allocation among flowers within inflorescences of sexually reproducing hermaphrodites.",2015
Temporal dynamics of a commensal network of cavity-nesting vertebrates: increased diversity during an insect outbreak,"cavity-nesting vertebrates; insect outbreak; interaction diversity; mountain pine beetle; nest web; network architecture; network dynamics; resource pulse; William's Lake, British Columbia, Canada",PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CRITICAL RESOURCE; PULSED RESOURCES; TREE SWALLOWS; COMMUNITIES; SELECTION; ROBUSTNESS,"Network analysis offers insight into the structure and function of ecological communities, but little is known about how empirical networks change over time during perturbations. ""Nest webs'' are commensal networks that link secondary cavity-nesting vertebrates (e.g., bluebirds, ducks, and squirrels, which depend on tree cavities for nesting) with the excavators (e.g., woodpeckers) that produce cavities. In central British Columbia, Canada, Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) is considered a keystone excavator, providing most cavities for secondary cavity-nesters. However, roles of species in the network, and overall network architecture, are expected to vary with population fluctuations. Many excavator species increased in abundance in association with a pulse of food (adult and larval beetles) during an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which peaked in 2003-2004. We studied nest-web dynamics from 1998 to 2011 to determine how network architecture changed during this resource pulse. Cavity availability increased at the onset of the beetle outbreak and peaked in 2005. During and after the outbreak, secondary cavity-nesters increased their use of cavities made by five species of beetle-eating excavators, and decreased their use of flicker cavities. We found low link turnover, with 74% of links conserved from year to year. Nevertheless, the network increased in evenness and diversity of interactions, and declined slightly in nestedness and niche overlap. These patterns remained evident seven years after the beetle outbreak, suggesting a legacy effect. In contrast to previous snapshot studies of nest webs, our dynamic approach reveals how the role of each cavity producer, and thus quantitative network architecture, can vary over time. The increase in interaction diversity with the beetle outbreak adds to growing evidence that insect outbreaks can increase components of biodiversity in forest ecosystems at various temporal scales. The observed changes in (quantitative) network architecture contrast with the relatively stable (qualitative) architecture of empirical mutualistic networks that have been studied to date. However, they are consistent with recent theory on the importance of population fluctuations in driving network architecture. Our results support the view that models should allow for the possibility of rewiring (species switching partners) to avoid overestimation of secondary extinction risk.",2015
Clustering methods differ in their ability to detect patterns in ecological networks,clustering; compartment; ecological network; module,COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIPARTITE NETWORKS; COMPARTMENTS; MODULARITY; ARCHITECTURE; GRAPHS,"Network ecology has been an extraordinarily fertile field of research over the last 20years. Its ultimate goal is to understand how the complex systems of interdependent species assemble, function and evolve. Here, we aimed to help ecologists to select the best methods for detecting subgroups of highly interacting species (usually referred to as compartments or modules) in bipartite networks (e.g. plant-pollinator networks, host-parasite networks), because these subgroups may reveal the processes underlying the assembly of the network and may influence its stability. We simulated several thousand bipartite ecological networks and we compared seven methods of network clustering in terms of their ability to retrieve the number and the composition of species subgroups. Among the seven methods compared, we found that the edge-betweenness algorithm was the best option for binary networks. The stochastic block model was the best method for weighted networks. Modularity maximization, the most popular clustering method in ecology, was among the three best methods in both cases. We thus provide ecology researchers with precise advice concerning the best choice of network clustering method, according to the type of data collected. We also provide the code for simulating bipartite networks and clustering them, in order to facilitate future methodological comparisons.",2015

Although improved techniques have increased interest in studying floral volatiles and nectar chemistry, these two foci have generally been studied in isolation. The ecological functions of floral chemistry have been relatively well studied and focused on pollinator behaviour. While studies comparing chemistry between plant parts and across phylogenies are increasing, work on the evolution of floral chemistry and the importance of community context in mediating pollinator responses is lacking. Future research should concentrate on more holistic studies that include both signal and reward chemistry to understand the relative contribution of these complex and dynamic floral traits to the ecology and evolution of plants and their pollinators.",2015
Variation in pollen limitation and floral parasitism across a mating system transition in a Pacific coastal dune plant: evolutionary causes or ecological consequences?,Beach evening primrose; Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia; coastal dunes; floral herbivory; fruit set; geographic variation; mating system variation; microlepidoptera; parasitism; pollen limitation; reproductive assurance; self-fertilization,CAMISSONIOPSIS-CHEIRANTHIFOLIA ONAGRACEAE; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; SELF-FERTILIZATION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; POLLINATOR SERVICE; CLARKIA-XANTIANA; POPULATION-SIZE; FLOWER SIZE; HERBIVORY; COMPATIBILITY,"Background and Aims Evolutionary transitions from outcrossing to self-fertilization are thought to occur because selfing provides reproductive assurance when pollinators or mates are scarce, but they could also occur via selection to reduce floral vulnerability to herbivores. This study investigated geographic covariation between floral morphology, fruit set, pollen limitation and florivory across the geographic range of Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia, a Pacific coastal dune endemic that varies strikingly in flower size and mating system. Methods Fruit set was quantified in 75 populations, and in 41 of these floral herbivory by larvae of a specialized moth (Mompha sp.) that consumes anthers in developing buds was also quantified. Experimental pollen supplementation was performed to quantify pollen limitation in three large-flowered, outcrossing and two small-flowered, selfing populations. These parameters were also compared between large-and small-flowered phenotypes within three mixed populations. Key Results Fruit set was much lower in large-flowered populations, and also much lower among large-than small-flowered plants within populations. Pollen supplementation increased per flower seed production in large-flowered but not small-flowered populations, but fruit set was not pollen limited. Hence inadequate pollination cannot account for the low fruit set of large-flowered plants. Floral herbivory was much more frequent in large-flowered populations and correlated negatively with fruit set. However, florivores did not preferentially attack large-flowered plants in three large-flowered populations or in two of three mixed populations. Conclusions Selfing alleviated pollen limitation of seeds per fruit, but florivory better explains the marked variation in fruit set. Although florivory was more frequent in large-flowered populations, large-flowered individuals were not generally more vulnerable within populations. Rather than a causative selective factor, reduced florivory in small-flowered, selfing populations is probably an ecological consequence of mating system differentiation, with potentially significant effects on population demography and biotic interactions.",2015

It is unclear, however, whether keystone species identity varies within a community type and what traits underlie this variation. Using a network biology approach, we assess whether keystone plant species vary across a metacommunity of five serpentine seeps in California and determine the features that predict their identity. We define keystone species as those with high strength, low node specialization index (NSI), and/or low d' and determine whether these parameters are predicted by floral traits (flower biomass, number of open flowers per plant, symmetry, or stamen number) and/or ecological features (variation in local floral abundance, endemism) within seeps and across the metacommunity. Keystone species identity varied among seeps and was associated with local flower abundance: mean floral abundance correlated positively with strength but negatively with NSI within most seeps as well as across the metacommunity. For the metacommunity, flower biomass correlated negatively with NSI while variation in flower abundance correlated negatively with strength. Across the metacommunity, the d' metric was associated with flower biomass, whereby plants with smaller flowers interacted with the most abundant pollinators across the metacommunity. Results suggest that connectance and interaction evenness may not be greatly influenced by community composition turnover due to substitution of keystone plant species across space. Keystone species can be predicted by functional traits but which trait (flower abundance or size) depended on the metric used and the level observed.",2015

Therefore, investigating the factors associated with high annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US is an important and active area of research. Pathogen incidence and abundance correlate with Colony Collapse Disorder- (CCD-) affected colonies in the US and colony losses in the US and in some European countries. Honey bees are readily infected by single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. Largely dependent on the host immune response, virus infections can either remain asymptomatic or result in deformities, paralysis, or death of adults or larvae. RNA interference (RNAi) is an important antiviral defense mechanism in insects, including honey bees. Herein, we review the role of RNAi in honey bee antiviral defense and highlight some parallels between insect and mammalian immune systems. A more thorough understanding of the role of pathogens on honey bee health and the immune mechanisms bees utilize to combat infectious agents may lead to the development of strategies that enhance honey bee health and result in the discovery of additional mechanisms of immunity in metazoans.",2015

Robustness of mutualistic networks under phenological change and habitat destruction,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEMS; SYSTEMS; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; ARCHITECTURE; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY,"Climate change can alter species phenologies and therefore disrupt species interactions. Habitat destruction can damage biodiversity and population viability. However, we still know very little about the potential effects of these two factors on the diversity and structure of interaction networks when both act simultaneously. Here we developed a mutualistic metacommunity model to explore the effects of habitat destruction and phenological changes on the diversity and structure of plant-pollinator networks. Using an empirical data set of plant and pollinator interactions and their duration in days, we simulated increasing levels of habitat destruction, under projected scenarios of phenological shifts as well for historically recorded changes in phenologies. On one hand, we found that habitat destruction causes catastrophic collapse in global diversity, as well as inducing alternative states. On the other hand, phenological shifts tend to make interactions weaker, increasing local extinction rates. Together, habitat destruction and phenological changes act synergistically, making metacommunities even more vulnerable to global collapse. Metacommunities are also more vulnerable to collapses under scenarios of historical change, in which phenologies are shortened, not just shifted. Furthermore, connectance and nestedness tends to decrease gradually with habitat destruction before the global collapse. Small phenological shifts can raise connectance slightly, due novel interactions appearing in a few generalist species, but larger shifts always reduce connectance. We conclude that the robustness of mutualistic metacommunities against habitat destruction can be greatly impaired by the weakening of positive interactions that results from the loss of phenological overlap.",2015

Interannual variation in seed production was extreme, generally asynchronous among species. All species exhibited high variability in seed production, ranging from bumper crops in some years to no seeds in others. All species exhibited a typical ""normal masting"" pattern, which was most pronounced in Picea abies and Quercus robur, moderate in Carpinus betulus and least expressed in Acer platanoides and Tilia cordata. Within species, crop sizes were well synchronised among areas and individuals; seed production was most synchronised in P. abies and Q. robur and least synchronised in T. cordata and A. platanoides within a season. Among species, interannual variability was negatively correlated with seasonal synchrony among individuals. Besides a negative correlation between rainfall during the flowering period and seed crop in three deciduous species, variation in temperature and rainfall in periods critical to seed formation was uncorrelated with the variation in seed crops. Heavy defoliation by caterpillars coincided with a poor seed crop of deciduous trees in 2003. Generally, the variation in seed crops was much higher than the variability of environmental factors. Deciduous species could produce bumper crops in consecutive years and were not necessarily forced to ""switch"" to non-reproduction by resource depletion. It appears that trees could apparently assess when and how intensively to reproduce. We discuss adaptive benefits of masting reproduction that include pollination efficiency, predator satiation and seed dispersal.",2015

This has recently been demonstrated in sexually deceptive orchids, where studies (1) quantified the strength of reproductive isolation in the field; (2) identified genes that appear to be causal for reproductive isolation; and (3) demonstrated selection by analysis of natural variation in gene sequence and expression. In a group of closely related Ophrys orchids, specific floral scent components, namely n-alkenes, are the key floral traits that control specific pollinator attraction by chemical mimicry of insect sex pheromones. The genetic basis of species-specific differences in alkene production mainly lies in two biosynthetic genes encoding stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturases (SAD) that are associated with floral scent variation and reproductive isolation between closely related species, and evolve under pollinator-mediated selection. However, the implications of this genetic architecture of key floral traits on the evolutionary processes of pollinator adaptation and speciation in this plant group remain unclear. Here, we expand on these recent findings to model scenarios of adaptive evolutionary change at SAD2 and SAD5, their effects on plant fitness (i.e., offspring number), and the dynamics of speciation. Our model suggests that the two-locus architecture of reproductive isolation allows for rapid sympatric speciation by pollinator shift; however, the likelihood of such pollinator-mediated speciation is asymmetric between the two orchid species O.sphegodes and O.exaltata due to different fitness effects of their predominant SAD2 and SAD5 alleles. Our study not only provides insight into pollinator adaptation and speciation mechanisms of sexually deceptive orchids but also demonstrates the power of applying a modeling approach to the study of pollinator-driven ecological speciation.",2015
Specialized and Generalized Pollen-Collection Strategies in an Ancient Bee Lineage,,POLLINATION SYSTEMS; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; APOIDEA; APIDAE; PHYLOGENY,"Iconic examples of insect pollination have emphasized narrowly specialized pollinator mutualisms such as figs and fig wasps [1] and yuccas and yucca moths [2]. However, recent attention by pollination ecologists has focused on the broad spectra of pollinated plants by generalist pollinators such as bees. Bees have great impact for formulating hypotheses regarding specialization versus generalization in pollination mutualisms [3, 4]. We report the pollination biology of six northern European species of an extinct tribe of pollen-basket-bearing apine bees, Electrapini, of early-middle Eocene age, examined from two deposits of 48 and 44 million years in age [5]. These bees exhibit a pattern of generalized, incidental pollen occurring randomly on their heads, thoraces, and abdomens, obtained from diverse, nectar-bearing plants. By contrast, a more restricted suite of pollen was acquired for metatibial pollen baskets (corbiculae) of the same bee taxa from a taxonomically much narrower suite of arborescent, evergreen hosts with uniform flower structure. The stereotyped plant sources of the specialist strategy of pollen collection consisted of pentamerous, radially symmetrical flowers with a conspicuous gynoecium surrounded by prominent nectar reward, organized in structurally similar compound inflorescences. Pollen specialization in bees occurs not for efficient pollination but rather in the corbiculate Electrapini as food for bee larvae (brood) and involves packing corbiculae with moistened pollen that rapidly loses viability with age. This specialist strategy was a well-developed preference by the early Eocene, providing a geochronologic midpoint assessment of bee pollen-collection strategies.",2015
EVOLUTION OF ANGIOSPERM POLLEN. 3. MONOCOTS,Character evolution; correlated evolution; exine stratification; habitat moisture; monocots; pollen morphology; pollination type; systematic significance,MORPHOLOGICAL PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; AMBORELLA-TRICHOPODA AMBORELLACEAE; GENE SEQUENCE DATA; EXINE-LESS POLLEN; RAIN-FOREST TAXA; BASAL ANGIOSPERMS; FLOWERING PLANTS; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; WALL DEVELOPMENT; AMPHIBOLIS-ANTARCTICA,"Monocots, with ca. 65,000 species in 78 families and 12 orders as classified by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III, 2009), have traditionally been known as a distinct assemblage from dicots within angiosperms and are now seen as a lineage that diverged from within the more basal of the angiosperm groupings. In this study, the third in a series analyzing pollen characters across the angiosperms, we illustrate the pollen morphological diversity of monocots and analyze 19 palynological and two ecological characters for 120 taxa in 71 families covering the 12 monocot orders and 16 taxa of nine orders in basal angiosperms. Pollen morphological data from previous works and our investigations were optimized onto a new maximum likelihood tree reconstructed from an existing DNA matrix of Chase et al. (2006) using Fitch parsimony, maximum likelihood, and hierarchical Bayesian analysis. From these analyses we infer evolutionary patterns in palynological characters, assess their systematic value, and investigate two aspects (pollination type and habitat moisture) of their ecological adaptation. The highest levels of pollen variation were shown to exist in the Alismatales and Commelinales, with lower levels seen in the Asparagales, Dasypogonales, and Zingiberales; the most variable characters across the phylogeny were found to be pollen outline in polar view, size, and tectum extent. We infer unambiguous plesiomorphic states for monocots and report significant transitions in character states at various levels within the monocot assemblage. Analyses of correlated evolution reconfirmed the hypothesis of an association between exine reduction (or complete loss) and habitat moisture and found significant correlations between various states of exine loss and habitat for hydrophytic-helophytic plants. The presence or absence of the exine itself was found to be more significantly correlated than individual structures, in terms of association with hydrophytic helophytic plants. The most rapid rate of state changes in pollen characters, in the evolutionary history of monocots, is estimated to have occurred during the Albian-Turonian stage; our work may provide insights into the identification of enigmatic fossil pollen grains from this geological time.",2015
The geography of divergence with gene flow facilitates multitrait adaptation and the evolution of pollinator isolation in Mimulus aurantiacus,Cline analysis; divergence with gene flow; divergent selection; hybrid zone; Mimulus; reproductive isolation,REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; HYBRID ZONES; POLLEN DISPERSAL; CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS; NATURAL-SELECTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; FLORAL ISOLATION; SPECIATION; HYBRIDIZATION; INVERSIONS,"Ecological adaptation is the driving force during divergence with gene flow and generates reproductive isolation early in speciation. Although gene flow opposes divergence, local adaptation can be facilitated by factors that prevent the breakup of favorable allelic combinations. We investigated how selection, genetic architecture, and geography have contributed to the maintenance of floral trait divergence and pollinator isolation between parapatric ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Combining greenhouse, field, and genomic studies, we show that sharp clines in floral traits are maintained by spatially varying selection. Although adaptation breaks down where the ecotypes co-occur, leading to the formation of a hybrid zone, the largely non-overlapping distributions of the ecotypes shield them from immigrant genes, facilitating divergence across most of the range. In contrast to the sharp genetic discontinuities observed across most hybrid zones, we observed a gradual cline in genome-wide divergence and a pattern of isolation by distance across the landscape. Thus, contrary to a long period of allopatry followed by recent re-contact, our data suggest that floral trait divergence in M. aurantiacus may have evolved with locally restricted, but ongoing gene flow. Therefore, our study reveals how the geographic distribution of an organism can contribute to the evolution of premating isolation in the early stages of divergence with gene flow.",2015
Does metabolic rate and evaporative water loss reflect differences in migratory strategy in sexually dimorphic hoverflies?,Episyrphus balteatus; Eristalis tenax; Syrphidae; Temperature; Evaporative water loss; Metabolic rate; Partial migration; Pollinator,EPISYRPHUS-BALTEATUS DIPTERA; GLOSSINA-PALLIDIPES DIPTERA; SUB-ANTARCTIC CATERPILLAR; BLACK-BROWED ALBATROSSES; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; BODY-MASS; ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; ENERGY-METABOLISM,"A typical explanation for ecologically stable strategies that apply to only a proportion of a population, is bet hedging, where increased reproductive success offsets reduced reproductive rate. One such is partial migration, where only a proportion of a population moves seasonally to avoid inclement climatic conditions. Bet hedging may overlook unseen costs to maintain broad physiological resilience, implied by encountering a breadth of environmental conditions. We investigated the physiological correlates of partial migration by measuring standard metabolic rates, and rates of evaporative water loss, and then estimating upper and lower thermal tolerance in males and females of two hoverfiy species, Episyrphus balteatus and Eristalis tenax. In central Europe, females of these species may either migrate or overwinter, whereas males may migrate south to the Mediterranean, but have not been found overwintering. Both species were sexually dimorphic; female Ep. balteatus were lighter than males, but female Er. tenax were heavier than males. While allometrically- corrected metabolic rate in both species increased with temperature, the most parsimonious models included no sex-specific differences in metabolic rate for either species. Evaporative water loss of both species also increased with temperature, but was higher for females of both species than males. Assuming that resting metabolism is congruent with the activity requirements of migration, highly consistent thermal tolerance and metabolic rate suggests that any given fly could migrate, although water loss patterns suggest that females may be less well-adapted to Mediterranean climates. We infer that partial migration probably results from the imperatives of their reproductive strategies.",2015
Functional structure and specialization in three tropical plant-hummingbird interaction networks across an elevational gradient in Costa Rica,,ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; POLLINATION; TRAITS; DIVERGENCE; FRAMEWORK; POLLEN,"Understanding causes of variation in multispecies assemblages along spatial environmental gradients is a long-standing research topic in ecology and biogeography. Ecological networks comprising interacting species of plants and pollinators are particularly suitable for testing effects of environmental gradients on the functional structure and specialization in multispecies assemblages. In this study, we investigated patterns in functional assemblage structure and specialization of hummingbirds at the individual and species level along a tropical elevational gradient. We mist-netted hummingbirds at three elevations in Costa Rica in seven temporally distinct sampling periods and used the pollen carried by hummingbird individuals to construct plant-hummingbird networks at each elevation. We measured four functional traits of hummingbird species and quantified different metrics of functional community structure. We tested the effect of elevation on functional metrics of hummingbird assemblages and specialization within the networks, employing the variability across sampling periods and hummingbird species to compare the respective metrics among elevations. Hummingbird species and individuals were more specialized at low and mid elevations than at the highest elevation. This pattern corresponded to a more even and over-dispersed assemblage structure at the lower elevations throughout the year and suggests a high level of floral resource partitioning in functionally diversified communities. In contrast, an uneven and clustered functional structure of the highland assemblage across all sampling periods suggests that this assemblage was structured by environmental filtering and by niche expansion of hummingbird individuals and species at this elevation. We conclude that high degrees of specialization on specific floral resources might be crucial for the coexistence of hummingbird species in diversified lowland communities. Spatial variation in animal resource use may be an important crucial driver of spatial patterns in the functional structure of diversified species assemblages also in other types of ecological networks.",2015
Molecular phylogenetics of the species-rich angiosperm genus Goniothalamus (Annonaceae) inferred from nine chloroplast DNA regions: Synapomorphies and putative correlated evolutionary changes in fruit and seed morphology,Annonaceae; Goniothalamus; Phylogeny; Magnoliid; Correlated character evolution; Morphological character evolution,BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; MIXED MODELS; NEW-GUINEA; LIKELIHOOD; SEQUENCES; SIGNAL; DIVERSIFICATION; DISPERSAL; TREES; PSEUDUVARIA,"A phylogenetic study of the genus Goniothalamus (Annonaceae) is presented using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, with 65 species sampled (48.5% of the genus) based on sequences of nine chloroplast DNA regions (11,214 aligned positions). The resultant phylogeny clearly indicates that Goniothalamus is monophyletic. Preliminary research initially focused on identifying synapomorphies and estimating the phylogenetic signal of selected morphological characters based on parsimony and likelihood ancestral character state reconstructions. This prescreening of characters enabled 40 to be selected for further study, and of these 15 are shown here to demonstrate significant phylogenetic signal and to provide clear synapomorphies for several infrageneric clades. Although floral structure in Goniothalamus is comparatively uniform, suggesting a common basic pattern of pollination ecology, fruit and seed morphology in the genus is very diverse and is presumably associated with different patterns of frugivory. The present study assesses correlations amongst fruit and seed characters which are putatively of functional importance with regard to frugivory and dispersal. One-way phylogenetic ANOVA indicates significant phylogenetically independent correlation between the following fruit and seed characters: fruits borne on older branches and/or on the main trunk have larger monocarps than fruits borne on young branches; and monocarps that contain seeds with a hairy testa are larger than those with glabrous seeds. We discuss fruit morphologies and potential explanations for the inferred correlations, and suggest that they may be the result of adaptation to different frugivores (birds, larger non-volant animal and primate seed dispersers, respectively).",2015
Indirect mutualism: ants protect fig seeds and pollen dispersers from parasites,Agaonidae; ant-plant; Ficus; species interaction; trophic relationship,WASP MUTUALISM; FIG/POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; COMPLEX INTERACTIONS; POLLINATING WASPS; HOST SANCTIONS; FICUS; PLANT; ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION; COEVOLUTION,"1. Mutualisms are ubiquitous and ecologically important, but may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation by species outside of the mutualism owing to a combination of an attractive reward and potentially limited defence options. For some mutualisms, ants can offer dynamic and relatively selective protection against herbivores and parasites. 2. The mutualism between fig trees and their pollinating wasps, a keystone mutualism in tropical forests, is particularly well suited for ant protection because pollinators are protected inside hollow inflorescences but parasites are exposed on the outside. 3. In the present study, it was shown that the presence of ants provides a fitness benefit for both the pollinators and the hosting fig tree. The presence of ants (i) reduced abortions of developing figs, (ii) reduced herbivory of figs, and (iii) reduced parasitic wasp loads, resulting in more pollinators and more seeds in ant-protected figs. Even when taking costs such as ant predation on emerging pollinators into account, the total fitness increase of hosting ants was threefold for the tree and fivefold for the pollinators. 4. It was further shown that the seemingly most vulnerable parasitic wasps, of the genus Idarnes, have a specific behaviour that allows them to evade ant attack while continuing to oviposit. 5. Ants were present on 79% of surveyed Panamanian fig trees. Together with previous studies from the Old World, the results found here imply that ants are both powerful and common protectors of the fig mutualism worldwide.",2015
Drivers of changes in ecosystem service values in Ganjiang upstream watershed,Ecosystem service value; Driving forces; Boosted regression tree; Ganjiang upstream watershed,POLLINATION SERVICES; LAND-USE; TREES,"Land use change and land-cover can influence ecological functions and ecosystem services. Based on Xie's coefficient of ecosystem service value, land use change in Ganjing upstream watershed from the year 1990 to 2010 and the ecosystem service value caused by the land use change were quantitatively analyzed. Based on the statistical data and relevant research results, a gray correlation degree analysis was done between ecosystem services value (ESV) and its seven potential impact factors, i.e. Grain for Green program, population, gross domestic product (GDP), urbanization level, investment in fixed assets, the proportion of secondary industry and tertiary industry proportion. The boosted regression tree method was used to identify the driving factors for the changes of ESV during 1990-2010, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 periods. The results showed that: (1) all seven indexes can affect the changes of ESV in Ganjiang upstream watershed during the study periods, (2) during 1990-2010 and from 2000 to 2005, the Grain for Green program is the most important factor influencing the ESV. The proportions of tertiary industry and GDP are the main factors influencing the ESV, whereas from 2000 to 2005 the main influential factor is GDP.     ",2015

Digestive capacity predicts diet diversity in Neotropical frugivorous bats,food quality; intake response; niche; null models; Phyllostomidae,PHYLLOSTOMID BATS; LEPTONYCTERIS-CURASOAE; NICHE OVERLAP; FOOD HARDNESS; FRUIT BATS; ASSEMBLAGES; ADAPTATION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR,"Predicting the diet diversity of animals is important to basic and applied ecology. Knowledge of diet diversity in animals helps us understand niche partitioning, functional diversity and ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control and seed dispersal. There is a negative relationship between the length of the digestive tract and diet diversity in animals; however, the role of digestive physiology in determining diet diversity has been ignored. This is especially important in vertebrates with powered flight because, unlike non-flying vertebrates, they have limitations that may constrain gut size. Here, we evaluate the relationship between digestive capacity and diet diversity in Carollinae and Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats. These bats disperse the seeds of plants that are key to Neotropical forest regeneration. Our results show that digestive capacity is a good predictor of diet diversity in Carollinae and Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats (R-2=077). Surprisingly, the most phylogenetically closely related species were not similar in their digestive capacity or diet diversity. The lack of a phylogenetic signal for the traits evaluated implies differences in digestive physiology and diet in closely related species. Our results highlight the predictive usefulness of digestive physiology for understanding the feeding ecology of animals.",2015
"Spatial Scales of Genetic Structure in Free-Standing and Strangler Figs (Ficus, Moraceae) Inhabiting Neotropical Forests",,TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; FRUIT CHARACTERISTICS; ARTIBEUS-JAMAICENSIS; POLLINATING WASPS; TREE; SOFTWARE; BAT; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY,"Wind-borne pollinating wasps (Agaonidae) can transport fig (Ficus sp., Moraceae) pollen over enormous distances (> 100 km). Because of their extensive breeding areas, Neotropical figs are expected to exhibit weak patterns of genetic structure at local and regional scales. We evaluated genetic structure at the regional to continental scale (Panama, Costa Rica, and Peru) for the free-standing fig species Ficus insipida. Genetic differentiation was detected only at distances > 300 km (Jost's D-est = 0.68 +/- 0.07 & F-ST = 0.30 +/- 0.03 between Mesoamerican and Amazonian sites) and evidence for phylogeographic structure (R-ST>>permuted R-ST) was only significant in comparisons between Central and South America. Further, we assessed local scale spatial genetic structure (SGS, d <= 8 km) in Panama and developed an agent-based model parameterized with data from F. insipida to estimate minimum pollination distances, which determine the contribution of pollen dispersal on SGS. The local scale data for F. insipida was compared to SGS data collected for an additional free-standing fig, F. yoponensis (subgenus Pharmacosycea), and two species of strangler figs, F. citrifolia and F. obtusifolia (subgenus Urostigma) sampled in Panama. All four species displayed significant SGS (mean Sp = 0.014 +/- 0.012). Model simulations indicated that most pollination events likely occur at distances > > 1 km, largely ruling out spatially limited pollen dispersal as the determinant of SGS in F. insipida and, by extension, the other fig species. Our results are consistent with the view that Ficus develops fine-scale SGS primarily as a result of localized seed dispersal and/or clumped seedling establishment despite extensive long-distance pollen dispersal. We discuss several ecological and life history factors that could have species-or subgenus-specific impacts on the genetic structure of Neotropical figs.",2015

Almost all apes, however, including bonobos Pan paniscus, are threatened with extinction. How will this affect tree conservation? How can plants that are adapted to seed dispersal by apes reproduce without their dispersal vectors? At LuiKotale, in an evergreen tropical forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the recruitment of 22 plant species in the absence of seed dispersal was investigated under the parental canopy, where a proportion of seeds fall without horizontal dissemination. Most bonobo-dispersed plant species (95% of 19 species) were unable to self-recruit under the canopy. As 40% of the tree species (65% of trees) at LuiKotale are dispersed by bonobos there is a risk of ecosystem decay and simplification (reduced biodiversity) if Pan paniscus disappears from its natural range. The extinction of other apes from their forests could have similar consequences. The conservation of tree species, therefore, must encompass conservation of pollinators, seed dispersal vectors and other species that provide ecological services to the trees and other fruiting plants.",2015

Thynnine wasps have a stark sexual dimorphism where males fly patrols in search of the flightless, predominantly fossorial females with which to mate. Using flow-through respirometry, we tested the prediction that the highly active males of the thynnine wasp Zaspilothynnus nigripes would have high metabolic rates (VCO2) relative to females. Further, the females, which spend more time underground, were predicted to exhibit lower evaporative water loss (EWL) than males. Metabolic rate of both sexes increased exponentially between 12 and 28 degrees C. As predicted, males had higher mass-corrected VCO2 at identical temperatures than females. Alternatively, there were no differences in the EWL at identical temperatures between sexes, suggesting that experiencing the same environmental conditions during mating may favour similar EWL. Interestingly, Z. nigripes were estimated to undergo a decrease in metabolism at approximately 30 degrees C. It is proposed that Z nigripes persist despite sensitivity to high temperatures using a combination of behavioural strategies and emergence during a period of relatively benign climate that ameliorates the impacts of high temperatures.

FLOWERING AND BIOMASS ALLOCATION IN US ATLANTIC COAST SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA,biomass allocation; flowering; phenology; seed supply; Spartina alterniflora,ENGLAND SALT-MARSH; SAN-FRANCISCO BAY; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SEED PRODUCTION; GLOBAL CHANGE; LIFE-CYCLES; CORDGRASS; PHENOLOGY; POLLINATION; DIVERSITY,"Premise of the study: Salt marshes are highly productive and valuable ecosystems, providing many services on which people depend. Spartina alterniflora Loisel (Poaceae) is a foundation species that builds and maintains salt marshes. Despite this species' importance, much of its basic reproductive biology is not well understood, including flowering phenology, seed production, and the effects of flowering on growth and biomass allocation. We sought to better understand these life history traits and use that knowledge to consider how this species may be affected by climate change. Methods: We examined temporal and spatial patterns in flowering and seed production in S. alterniflora at a latitudinal scale (along the U.S. Atlantic coast), regional scale (within New England), and local scale (among subhabitats within marshes) and determined the impact of flowering on growth allocation using field and greenhouse studies. Key results: Flowering stem density did not vary along a latitudinal gradient, while at the local scale plants in the less submerged panne subhabitats produced fewer flowers and seeds than those in more frequently submerged subhabitats. We also found that a shift in biomass allocation from above to belowground was temporally related to flowering phenology. Conclusions: We expect that environmental change will affect seed production and that the phenological relationship with flowering will result in limitations to belowground production and thus affect marsh elevation gain. Salt marshes provide an excellent model system for exploring the interactions between plant ecology and ecosystem functioning, enabling better predictions of climate change impacts.",2015
FLORAL BIOLOGY AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF DESMOS CHINENSIS (ANNONACEAE): ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF FLORAL SYNCHRONY FOR PROMOTING XENOGAMY,Annonaceae; breeding system; floral scent; floral synchrony; pollination; xenogamy,POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; BREEDING SYSTEMS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; MATING SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; ANGIOSPERMS; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; MAGNOLIACEAE,"Premise of research. Early-divergent angiosperms typically possess hermaphroditic flowers but often lack any biochemically mediated self-incompatibility mechanism. Although outcrossing is generally promoted in these taxa by protogyny, which is effective for precluding autogamy (self-fertilization within a flower), other mechanisms are necessary to prevent geitonogamy (self-pollination between different flowers within an individual). In this article we investigate the occurrence and efficacy of inter- and intraindividual floral synchrony for preventing geitonogamy in the early-divergent angiosperm Desmos chinensis (Annonaceae) within the context of the overall floral biology and pollination ecology of the species. Methodology. We assess the floral phenology (at the flower, individual plant, and population levels), floral scent chemistry, pollination ecology, and breeding system of D. chinensis. Pivotal results. Desmos chinensis is pollinated by small Amystrops beetles (Nitidulidae) that are attracted by floral scent. Although the flowers are hermaphroditic and self-compatible, population genetic analysis indicates that the species is likely to be predominantly xenogamous (outcrossing): most of the genetic diversity occurs within populations, with evidence of extensive gene flow. The flowers are protogynous, with anthesis lasting ca, 27 h. and with a 6-h nonsexual interim phase separating the functional pistillate and staminate phases. Although protogyny is an effective mechanism to prevent autogamy, it cannot prevent geitonogamy. Conclusions. We demonstrate the existence of inter- and intraindividual floral synchrony in D. chinensis, in which pistillate- and staminate-phase flowers rarely coexist within an individual, thereby largely precluding the possibility of geitonogamy. We suggest that inter- and intraindividual floral synchrony may be much more common than previous studies suggest. Since the phenomenon is known from several phylogenetically disparate lineages in the family and has possibly evolved independently, it may endow a significant selective advantage for promoting xenogamy.",2015

Petunia axillaris (Solanaceae) includes three allopatric subspecies widely distributed in temperate South America that present different degrees of self-compatibity and incompatibility. One of these subspecies is co-distributed with P. exserta in a restricted area and presents a complex, not well-understood mating system. Artificial crossing experiments suggest a complex system of mating in this sympatric area. The main aims of this study were to estimate the pollen dispersal distance and to evaluate the breeding structure of P. axillaris subsp. axillaris, a hawkmoth-pollinated taxon from this sympatric zone. Methods Pollen dispersal distance was compared with nearest-neighbours distance, and the differentiation in the pollen pool among mother plants was estimated. In addition, the correlation between genetic differentiation and spatial distance among plants was tested. All adult individuals (252) within a space of 2800 m(2) and 15 open-pollinated progeny (285 seedlings) were analysed. Genetic analyses were based on 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Key Results A high proportion of self-pollination was found, indicating a mixed-mating system. The maximum pollen dispersal distance was 1013 m, but most pollination events (96 %) occurred at a distance of 0m, predominantly in an inbreeding system. Both parents among sampled individuals could be identifed in 60-85 % of the progeny. Conclusions The results show that most pollen dispersal in the hawkmoth-pollinated P. axillaris subsp. axillaris occurs within populations and there is a high proportion of inbreeding. This mating system appears to favour species integrity in a secondary contact zone with the congener species P. exserta.",2015

However, little is known about how possible ecological or functional implications of horizontal and vertical positioning of flowers affect pollinator decision making. Flowers are commonly either arranged horizontally in meadows or vertically in inflorescences and blooming trees or bushes. Using bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), we here investigate if these 2 different foraging scenarios affect decision-making accuracy using an operant learning paradigm. Training foragers to feeders arranged either horizontally or vertically but bearing identical color or pattern cues, we found a highly significant and consistent difference in feeder choice accuracy. Bees presented with horizontally arranged feeders achieved accuracies of more than 90% by the end of the training. In contrast, bees foraging on vertically arranged feeders largely disregarded the feeder cues and accuracies remained well below 70%. Apart from feeder arrangement (horizontal, vertical) neither cue type (color, pattern), feeder display orientation (horizontal, vertical) nor vertical feeder distribution contributed significantly to choice accuracy. Training bees successively on vertical, horizontal, and vertical feeder arrays revealed that individual bees are capable of discriminating the presented feeder cues with high precision on the horizontal plane but did not use the acquired knowledge on subsequently presented vertically arranged feeders. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of flowers has marked effects on the foraging strategy employed by a generalist pollinator. We discuss the broader implications of foragers selectively allocating attention to focus on or disregard environmental information depending on spatial context.",2015
Effects of floral sexual investment and dichogamy on floral longevity,floral longevity; female phase duration; male phase duration; flower size; floral sexual investment; dichogamy,POLLINATION SUCCESS; INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS; ALLOCATION; POLLEN; ORCHIDACEAE; CAMPANULACEAE; ASSOCIATION; STIGMAS; GENDER; PLANTS,"Aims Floral longevity, the duration that a flower remains open and functional, varies greatly among species. Variation in floral longevity has been considered to be optimal strategy for resource allocation under different ecological conditions, mainly determined by the rates of pollination and cost of flower maintenance. However, it is unclear whether an intrinsic factor, floral sexual investment, constrains evolution of floral longevity. The theoretical model also predicts that dichogamy favors long-lived flowers, but empirical studies to test this prediction remain unexplored. Methods To examine the effect of floral sexual investment on floral longevity, we measured flower size together with pollen and ovule production in 37 sympatric flowering plants in a natural community. The duration of the female and male phase in 21 protandrous species and floral longevity of the other 16 adichogamous species were documented in the field. Important Findings Floral longevity varied from 1 day to 15 days, while pollen number per flower varied from 643 to 710 880 and ovule number per flower from 1 to 426 in the 37 species. Flower size was correlated with pollen production as well as ovule production. Floral longevity was positively related to pollen production but not to ovule production. Consistent with the prediction that dichogamy favors long-lived flowers, we found the floral longevity of protandrous species was significantly longer than that of adichogamous species. In the protandrous species, pollen production per flower was observed to be positively related to male duration, while ovule production was not related to female duration. Our analyses of variation in floral longevity and sexual investment among different species suggest that the floral sexual investment could be an intrinsic factor contributing to the selected floral longevity, particularly the male phase, and that high pollen production could potentially increase pollen removal, i.e. male productive success.",2015

Based on a terrestrial transport infrastructure project, the objective of this paper is to quantify the potential loss of ES associated with direct and indirect impacts, and illustrate their contribution to decision-making for route options. We first quantify how much of each type of ES is generated by different land units in the absence of the infrastructure (baseline conditions). We then estimate ES loss caused by infrastructure construction in a way that discriminates among different types of ES and losses because some ES, in addition to losses that are directly proportional to the surface impacted, can show additional indirect losses associated with landscape connectivity. In addition, we illustrate how the assessment of threshold effects in particular ecosystem types that may be most sensitive to their occurrence can affect the estimation of ES loss. We compare implementation options to provide an example of how choices can be improved by assessing ES loss associated with a combination of direct and indirect impacts. This kind of analysis could be used more generally to assess development projects simply by adapting the framework of analysis to the type of project and the ecosystems concerned.     ",2015
Turnover and reliability of flower communities in extreme environments: Insights from long-term phenology data sets,Flowering phonology; Community ecology; Pollinators; Desert ecology; Turnover rates,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELEVATION GRADIENT; SONORAN DESERT; THOREAUS WOODS; PRAIRIE PLANTS; PATTERNS; RESPONSES; SPECIALIZATION; PRECIPITATION; FLUCTUATION,"We used three long-term data sets from the southwestern US to investigate the reliability of flowering communities from the perspective of pollinators in extreme environments. The data sets come from three desert sites in New Mexico, two subalpine sites in Colorado, and an elevation gradient in Arizona. We used two indices to explore different temporal scales. We calculated turnover rates of species in bloom on a seasonal basis to investigate how flowering communities change from year to year. We calculated frequency of bloom in the same month over all years to determine the reliability of flowering communities in a narrow time scale. We hypothesized that communities with less reliable precipitation would have lower frequency of bloom and higher turnover rates and that annual plants would show this pattern more strongly than perennials. Flower frequency ranged from 50.3% at the highest elevation AZ site to 66.3% at a subalpine CO site. Within each site, annuals exhibited lower frequencies than perennials. On a seasonal scale, turnover rates ranged from 22.5% in Colorado to 71.4% at a NM site. Looking at the entire flower community as a resource for foraging pollinators, we found that flowers are an unreliable resource, especially in unpredictable environments.",2015
Mast fruiting in a hawkmoth-pollinated orchid Habenaria glaucifolia: an 8-year survey,Habenaria glaucifolia; mast fruiting; Orchidaceae; pollinator scarcity; pollen limitation; pollinia movement; 'sit and wait' strategy,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; POLLEN LIMITATION; REPRODUCTION; DIPTEROCARPACEAE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; TEMPERATE; PATTERNS; SURVIVAL; SUCCESS; BIOLOGY,"Aims The hypothesis of predator satiation has been proposed to explain mast fruiting in various flowering plants. It considers that the simultaneous production of large numbers of seeds by a plant population reduces the risk of seed predation for each individual. Orchids produce huge numbers of seeds per fruit and rarely experience seed predation. It remains unclear which factors may affect fluctuating fruit production in orchids, which generally suffer a widespread pollen limitation. To explore the temporal pattern of fruiting and potential factors related to fluctuation in fruit production, we investigated reproductive success of a long-spurred orchid (Habenaria glaucifolia) in an alpine meadow with thousands of individuals over 8 years. Methods To estimate reproductive success, pollinator observation was conducted by day and at night, and pollinia removal and receipt were recorded in the field population for 8 years. To examine whether fruit set and seed set are pollen limited, we conducted supplementary pollination experiments and compared fruit set, seed set and pollinia movement of open-pollinated flowers from 2011 to 2013. We measured lengths of spurs and pollinator proboscises, and nectar volume and concentration, to identify potential pollinators. Important Findings Hawkmoths were seen to be effective pollinators for H. glaucifolia in 3 years, whereas in the remaining 5 years no pollinators were observed, and consequently pollinia were rarely transferred. Numerous pollinia movements were observed in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (pollinia removal: 48, 59 and 85%; pollinia receipt 51, 70 and 80%), and correspondingly fruit set was significantly higher in 2012 and 2013 (59 and 46%) than in 2011 (25%). It was fruit set, rather than seed set, that was pollen limited in this orchid in the 3 years, in that supplementary pollination increased fruit set but did not increase seed set per fruit compared to natural. Three species of hawkmoths had proboscis lengths that matched the spur length of H. glaucifolia. Fruit set in this long spurred orchid depends on the activity of long-tongued hawkmoths, resulting in significant temporal variation in fruit production. Mast fruiting in this alpine orchid could be attributed to a 'sit and wait' strategy, awaiting an abundance of effective pollinators.",2015
Absence of Sex Differential Plasticity to Light Availability during Seed Maturation in Geranium sylvaticum,,GYNODIOECIOUS ANGIOSPERMS; REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT; MACULATUM; HERMAPHRODITES; POLLINATION; ALLOCATION; EVOLUTION; FEMALES; POLLEN; PLANT,"Sex-differential plasticity (SDP) hypothesis suggests that since hermaphrodites gain fitness through both pollen and seed production they may have evolved a higher degree of plasticity in their reproductive strategy compared to females which achieve fitness only through seed production. SDP may explain the difference in seed production observed between sexes in gynodioecious species in response to resource (nutrients or water) availability. In harsh environments, hermaphrodites decrease seed production whereas females keep it relatively similar regardless of the environmental conditions. Light availability can be also a limiting resource and thus could theoretically affect differently female and hermaphrodite seed output even though this ecological factor has been largely overlooked. We tested whether the two sexes in the gynodioecious species Geranium sylvaticum differ in their tolerance to light limitation during seed maturation in the field. We used a fully factorial block experiment exposing female and hermaphrodite plants to two different light environments (control and shade) after their peak flowering period. Specifically, we measured fruit and seed production in response to decreased light availability and compared it between the sexes. Shading reduced the number of fruits and seeds produced, but the decrease was similar between the sexes. Furthermore, shading delayed seed production by three days in both sexes, but did not affect seed mass, seed P content, or the probability of re-flowering the following year. Our results give no evidence for reproductive SDP in response to light during seed maturation.",2015
Cheap Food and Bad Climate: From Surplus Value to Negative Value in the Capitalist World-Ecology,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; INDUSTRIAL-REVOLUTION; ENGLISH-AGRICULTURE; GREEN-REVOLUTION; METABOLIC RIFT; HEAVY-METALS; US; SOVEREIGNTY; ENGLAND; YIELDS,"Capitalism, understood as a world-ecology that joins accumulation, power, and nature in dialectical unity, has been adept at evading so-called Malthusian dynamics through an astonishing historical capacity to produce, locate, and occupy cheap natures external to the system. In recent decades, the last frontiers have closed, and this astonishing historical capacity has withered. This ""withering"" is perhaps most evident in capitalism's failure to offer a new, actually productive, agricultural model-as agrobiotechnology failed to deliver on its promissory notes. Moving from bad to worse, a second set of contradictions is now mediated through climate change. Climate change, one among many ongoing biospheric shifts, is interwoven with the totality of neoliberal agriculture's contradictions to produce a new contradiction: negative value. This signals the emergence of forms of nature that are increasingly hostile to capital accumulation and that can be temporarily fixed (if at all) only through increasingly costly, toxic, and dangerous strategies. The rise of negative value-whose accumulation has been latent for much of capitalist history-therefore suggests a significant and rapid erosion of opportunities for the appropriation of new streams of unpaid work/energy. As such, these new limits are qualitatively different from the nutrient and resource depletion of earlier, developmental crises of the longue duree Cheap Food model. These contradictions, within capital, arising from negative value, are today encouraging an unprecedented shift toward a radical ontological politics, within capitalism as a whole, that destabilizes crucial points of agreement in the modern world system: What is food? What is nature? What is valuable?",2015

As a result of interspecific interactions such as pollination, the decline, loss, or introduction of species can have cascading effects on island ecosystems. We studied Hylaeus spp., Hawai'i's yellow-faced bees, the only native bees in Hawai'i. This group of potentially important pollinators has been largely overlooked until recently, and its conservation status and ecological role are virtually unknown. We investigated how native (Hylaeus spp.) and nonnative (Apis mellifera) bees interact with flowering plants in a large-scale pasture-to-forest restoration system. We used pan traps and nets to collect bees in mature forest, remnant corridors, planted Acacia koa tracts, and open pastureland. We removed pollen from each specimen and identified it using pollen samples collected on-site. We found that Hylaeus spp. were more likely to carry less pollen and more likely to exhibit higher pollinator fidelity compared with A. mellifera. By contrast, A. mellifera was more likely to carry mixed pollen and forage on invasive plant species. This is the first investigation in Hawai` i to compare patterns of pollen carriage between native and nonnative bees and the first study to document pollen carried by Hylaeus spp. in the context of forest restoration.",2015

This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.",2015

Bipartite networks from previous research from 68 locations globally were analyzed. Using a meta-analysis approach, we examine relationships between the structure of 22 trophic and 46 mutualistic bipartite networks in response to extensive gradients of temperature and precipitation. Network structures varied significantly across temperature gradients. Trophic networks showed decreasing modularity with increasing variation in temperature within years. Nestedness of mutualistic networks decreased with increasing temperature variability between years. Mean annual precipitation and variability of precipitation were not found to have significant influence on the structure of either trophic or mutualistic networks. By examining changes in ecological networks across large-scale abiotic gradients, this study identifies temperature variability as a potential environmental mediator of community stability. Understanding these relationships contributes to our ability to predict responses of biodiversity to climate change at the community level.",2015
Caffeinated Forage Tricks Honeybees into Increasing Foraging and Recruitment Behaviors,,NECTAR; POLLINATION; EXAPTATION; COLONIES; SCIENCE,"In pollination, plants provide food reward to pollinators who in turn enhance plant reproduction by transferring pollen, making the relationship largely cooperative; however, because the interests of plants and pollinators do not always align, there exists the potential for conflict, where it may benefit both to cheat the other [1, 2]. Plants may even resort to chemistry: caffeine, a naturally occurring, bitter-tasting, pharmacologically active secondary compound whose main purpose is to detract herbivores [3-6], is also found in lower concentrations in the nectar of some plants, even though nectar, unlike leaves, is made to be consumed by pollinators [5, 7, 8]. A recent laboratory study showed that caffeine may lead to efficient and effective foraging by aiding honeybee memory of a learned olfactory association [4], suggesting that caffeine may enhance bee reward perception. However, without field data, the wider ecological significance of caffeinated nectar remains difficult to interpret. Here we demonstrate in the field that caffeine generates significant individual- and colony-level effects in free-flying worker honeybees. Compared to a control, a sucrose solution with field-realistic doses of caffeine caused honeybees to significantly increase their foraging frequency, waggle dancing probability and frequency, and persistency and specificity to the forage location, resulting in a quadrupling of colony-level recruitment. An agent-based model also demonstrates how caffeine-enhanced foraging may reduce honey storage. Overall, caffeine causes bees to overestimate forage quality, tempting the colony into sub-optimal foraging strategies, which makes the relationship between pollinator and plant less mutualistic and more exploitative.",2015

Highly attractive floral traits may, however, also increase the degree of self-pollination, which could become detrimental for plant fitness through inbreeding depression. Floral nectar is a trait that is known to strongly mediate pollinator attraction and plant reproductive success, but the particular role of the nectar amino acid (AA) composition is poorly understood. Therefore, we experimentally manipulated the nectar AA composition and abundance of the Lepidoptera-pollinated orchid Gymnadenia conopsea through soil fertilization, and we quantified AA content and AA composition through high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Mixed models were then used to evaluate differences in pollinia removal, fruit set, seed set and degree of selfing between fertilized and control individuals. Selfing rates were estimated using microsatellite markers. We found that fertilized individuals had a significantly higher nectar AA content and an altered AA composition, whereas plant height, number of flowers, nectar volume and sugar concentration remained unchanged. Fertilized individuals also had significantly more pollinia removed and a higher fruit set, whereas control plants that did not receive the fertilization treatment had significantly fewer selfed seeds, and more viable seeds. Although we cannot exclude a role of changes in floral scent following the fertilization treatment, our results strongly suggest a relation among nectar AA composition, fruiting success and selfing rates. Our results also indicate potential consequences of nutrient pollution for plant reproductive success, through the induced changes in nectar AA composition.",2015
Plant reproductive traits mediate tritrophic feedback effects within an obligate brood-site pollination mutualism,Inflorescence size; Interaction web; Feedback cycle; Plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions; Trait-mediated indirect effect,FIG/FIG WASP MUTUALISM; FIG WASPS; FLOWERING ASYNCHRONY; POSITIVE FEEDBACK; NATURAL ENEMIES; YUCCA MOTHS; COMMUNITIES; FACILITATION; PARASITOIDS; HERBIVORES,"Plants, herbivores and parasitoids affect each other directly and indirectly; however, feedback effects mediated by host plant traits have rarely been demonstrated in these tritrophic interactions. Brood-site pollination mutualisms (e.g. those involving figs and fig wasps) represent specialised tritrophic communities where the progeny of mutualistic pollinators and of non-mutualistic gallers (both herbivores) together with that of their parasitoids develop within enclosed inflorescences called syconia (hence termed brood-sites or microcosms). Plant reproductive phenology (which affects temporal brood-site availability) and inflorescence size (representing brood-site size) are plant traits that could affect reproductive resources, and hence relationships between trees, pollinators and non-pollinating wasps. Analysing wasp and seed contents of syconia, we examined direct, indirect, trophic and non-trophic relationships within the interaction web of the fig-fig wasp community of Ficus racemosa in the context of brood site size and availability. We demonstrate that in addition to direct resource competition and predator-prey (host-parasitoid) interactions, these communities display exploitative or apparent competition and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Inflorescence size and plant reproductive phenology impacted plant-herbivore and plant-parasitoid associations. These plant traits also influenced herbivore-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid relationships via indirect effects. Most importantly, we found a reciprocal effect between within-tree reproductive asynchrony and fig wasp progeny abundances per syconium that drives a positive feedback cycle within the system. The impact of a multitrophic feedback cycle within a community built around a mutualistic core highlights the need for a holistic view of plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions in the community ecology of mutualisms.",2015

Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",2015
Unbiased inference of plant flowering phenology from biological recording data,Bayesian model; citizen science; climate change; discrete Fourier transform; growing degree days; phenology model; recorder effort,CLIMATE-CHANGE; CITIZEN SCIENCE; BIAS; 1ST; TEMPERATURE; BUTTERFLIES,"Phenology is a key indicator and mediator of the ecological impacts of climate change. However, studies monitoring the phenology of individual species are moderate in number, taxonomically and geographically restricted, and mainly focused on spring events. As such, attention is being given to nonstandard sources of phenology data, such as the dates of species' biological records. Here, we present a conceptual framework for deriving phenological metrics from biological recording data, while accounting for seasonal variation in the level of activity by recorders. We develop a new Bayesian statistical model to infer the seasonal pattern of plant recordability'. The modelled dates of maximum recordability are strongly indicative of the flowering peaks of 29 insect-pollinated species monitored in two botanic gardens in Great Britain. Conversely, not accounting for the seasonality in recording activity results in biased estimates of the observed flowering peaks. However, observed first and last flowering dates were less reliably explained by the model, which probably reflects greater interspecific variation in levels of recording before and after flowering. We conclude that our method provides new potential for gaining useful insights into large-scale variation in peak phenology across a much broader range of plant species than have previously been studied.",2015
Trade-Offs and Coexistence in Fluctuating Environments: Evidence for a Key Dispersal-Fecundity Trade-Off in Five Nonpollinating Fig Wasps,coexistence; ephemeral patch; competition; trade-offs; Ficus; dispersal; fig wasp,EGG MATURATION STRATEGY; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; COMPETITIVE COEXISTENCE; SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; FLOWERING ASYNCHRONY; COMMUNITIES; AGGREGATION; DYNAMICS; COLONIZATION,"The ecological principle of competitive exclusion states that species competing for identical resources cannot coexist, but this principle is paradoxical because ecologically similar competitors are regularly observed. Coexistence is possible under some conditions if a fluctuating environment changes the competitive dominance of species. This change in competitive dominance implies the existence of trade-offs underlying species' competitive abilities in different environments. Theory shows that fluctuating distance between resource patches can facilitate coexistence in ephemeral patch competitors, given a functional trade-off between species dispersal ability and fecundity. We find evidence supporting this trade-off in a guild of five ecologically similar nonpollinating fig wasps and subsequently predict local among-patch species densities. We also introduce a novel colonization index to estimate relative dispersal ability among ephemeral patch competitors. We suggest that a dispersal ability-fecundity trade-off and spatiotemporally fluctuating resource availability commonly co-occur to drive population dynamics and facilitate coexistence in ephemeral patch communities.",2015

The family was once more diverse and widespread, with an additional six extinct taxa recorded from Australia and New Zealand. Here, a new mystacinid is described from the early Miocene (19-16 Ma) St Bathans Fauna of Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand. It is the first pre-Pleistocene record of the modern genus and it extends the evolutionary history of Mystacina back at least 16 million years. Extant Mystacina species occupy old-growth rainforest and are semi-terrestrial with an exceptionally broad omnivorous diet. The majority of the plants inhabited, pollinated, dispersed or eaten by modern Mystacina were well-established in southern New Zealand in the early Miocene, based on the fossil record from sites at or near where the bat fossils are found. Similarly, many of the arthropod prey of living Mystacina are recorded as fossils in the same area. Although none of the Miocene plant and arthropod species is extant, most are closely related to modern taxa, demonstrating potentially long-standing ecological associations with Mystacina.",2015

Several of those species build their own nests, while others are reported as nest cleptoparasites. Here, the objective was to evaluate whether the inclusion of a strong biotic interaction, such as the presence of a host species, improved the ability of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the geographic range of the cleptoparasite species. The target species were Aglae caerulea and its host species Eulaema nigrita. Additionally, since Aglae caerulea is more frequently found in the Amazon rather than the Cerrado areas, a secondary objective was to evaluate whether this species is increasing or decreasing its distribution given South American past and current climatic conditions. SDMs methods (Maxent and Bioclim), in addition with current and past South American climatic conditions, as well as the occurrences for Aglae caerulea and Eulaema nigrita were used to generate the distribution models. The distribution of Aglae caerulea was generated with and without the inclusion of the distribution of Eulaema nigrita as a predictor variable. The results indicate Aglae caerulea was barely affected by past climatic conditions and the populations from the Cerrado savanna could be at least 21,000 years old (the last glacial maximum), as well as the Amazonian ones. On the other hand, in this study, the inclusion of the host-cleptoparasite interaction complex did not statistically improve the quality of the produced models, which means that the geographic range of this cleptoparasite species is mainly constrained by climate and not by the presence of the host species. Nonetheless, this could also be caused by unknown complexes of other Euglossini hosts with Aglae caerulea, which still are still needed to be described by science.",2015

To unravel dynamics underlying metabolic diversification, it is critical to determine lineage-specific gene family expansion in a phylogenomics framework. However, robust functional annotation is often only available for core enzymes catalyzing committed reaction steps within few model systems. In a genome informatics approach, we extracted information from early-draft gene-space assemblies and non-redundant transcriptomes to identify protein families involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Isoprenoids comprise terpenoids with various roles in plant-environment interaction, such as pollinator attraction or pathogen defense. Combining lines of evidence provided by synteny, sequence homology and Hidden-Markov-Modelling, we screened 17 genomes including 12 major crops and found evidence for 1,904 proteins associated with terpenoid biosynthesis. Our terpenoid genes set contains evidence for 840 core terpene-synthases and 338 triterpene-specific synthases. We further identified 190 prenyltransferases, 39 isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerases as well as 278 and 219 proteins involved in mevalonate and methylerithrol pathways, respectively. Assessing the impact of gene and genome duplication to lineage-specific terpenoid pathway expansion, we illustrated key events underlying terpenoid metabolic diversification within 250 million years of flowering plant radiation. By quantifying Angiosperm-wide versatility and phylogenetic relationships of pleiotropic gene families in terpenoid modular pathways, our analysis offers significant insight into evolutionary dynamics underlying diversification of plant secondary metabolism. Furthermore, our data provide a blueprint for future efforts to identify and more rapidly clone terpenoid biosynthetic genes from any plant species.",2015

There has been a rising interest in recent years to characterize the topology of such networks along various gradients (e.g. successional, climatic, elevational) to better understand how they assemble in space and time. However, to compare structure of networks that vary in size, shape and connectance, topological metrics need to be standardized (as most metrics covary with such network attributes). Traditionally, this has been done by transforming network metrics into z-scores prior comparisons. Here, I show that such standardized metrics are not independent of basic network properties such as connectance. Instead, I found that there was a consistent tendency for z-scores to approach 0 when connectance progressively decreased and approached its minimal value. This is probably due to the reduced null space available for null models to randomize interactions at such low connectance. I discuss ways to circumvent the problem in future studies.    ",2015

Heliconia species are some of the most important tropical flowers in Brazil. Mites of the families Ascidae, Blattisociidae and Melicharidae are commonly found on those plants. They disperse from flower to flower on hummingbirds. The objective of this study was to identify the diversity of mites of this group in tropical flowers, with emphasis on Heliconia species, in Brazil and to determine the fluctuation of the population of these mites in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state. Specimens from Amazonas, Bahia, Pernambuco, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and So Paulo States were examined. Mites of the genera Asca and Iphidozercon (Ascidae), Cheiroseius and Lasioseius (Blattisociidae), and Proctolaelaps and Tropicoseius (Melicharidae) were collected in flowers of four plant families, with Lasioseius being the most diverse genus. Overall, most specimens found belonged to Tropicoseius, especially Tropicoseius venezuelensis Baker & Yunker; this was the dominant species on five of 13 Heliconia species/hybrids considered in this study. Samples of panicles of Heliconia rostrata Ruiz & Pavn were collected every 2 weeks, in Piracicaba. Six species of those mite families were found, among which Tropicoseius heliconiae Baker & Yunker and T. venezuelensis were the most numerous. The highest population levels of mites of those three families occurred at the beginning and at the end of the year, coinciding with the highest levels of rainfall, relative humidity and temperature, when plant flowers were most numerous and vigorous. Along each panicle, the highest mite densities were found in inflorescences of the three distal eighths of the panicles, where nectar and pollen were probably most abundant.",2015
The Colonisation of Exotic Species Does Not Have to Trigger Faunal Homogenisation: Lessons from the Assembly Patterns of Arthropods on Oceanic Islands,,NESTED SUBSET PATTERNS; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; BETA-DIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; TAXONOMIC HOMOGENIZATION; POLLINATION NETWORKS; PLANT INVASIONS; MASS EXTINCTION; ANTI-NESTEDNESS; RICHNESS,"Human-caused disturbances can lead to the extinction of indigenous (endemic and native) species, while facilitating and increasing the colonisation of exotic species; this increase can, in turn, promote the similarity of species compositions between sites if human-disturbed sites are consistently invaded by a regionally species-poor pool of exotic species. In this study, we analysed the extent to which epigean arthropod assemblages of four islands of the Azorean archipelago are characterised by nestedness according to a habitat-altered gradient. The degree of nestedness represents the extent to which less ubiquitous species occur in subsets of sites occupied by the more widespread species, resulting in an ordered loss/gain of species across environmental or ecological gradients. A predictable loss of species across communities while maintaining others may lead to more similar communities (i.e. lower beta-diversity). In contrast, anti-nestedness occurs when different species tend to occupy distinct sites, thus characterising a replacement of species across such gradients. Our results showed that an increase in exotic species does not promote assemblage homogenisation at the habitat level. On the contrary, exotic species were revealed as habitat specialists that constitute new and well-differentiated assemblages, even increasing the species compositional heterogeneity within human-altered landscapes. Therefore, contrary to expectations, our results show that both indigenous and exotic species established idiosyncratic assemblages within habitats and islands. We suggest that both the historical extinction of indigenous species in disturbed habitats and the habitat-specialised character of some exotic invasions have contributed to the construction of current assemblages.",2015

In this study, we compiled records on the Ficus flora of Taiwan and its associated wasp fauna. Initial agronomic research reports on Ficus were published in Japanese in 1917, followed by reports on applied biochemistry, taxonomy, and phenology in Chinese. On the basis of the phenological knowledge of 15 species of the Ficus flora of Taiwan, recent research has examined the pollinating and nonpollinating agaonid and chalcid wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea). Updating records according to the current nomenclature revealed that there are 30 taxa (27 species) of native or naturalized Ficus with an unusually high proportion of dioecious species (78%). Four species were observed to exhibit mutualism with more than one pollinating wasp species, and 18 of the 27 Ficus species were reported with nonpollinating wasp species. The number of nonpollinating wasp species associated with specific Ficus species ranges from zero (F. pumila) to 24 (F. microcarpa). Approximately half of the Taiwanese fig tree species have been studied with basic information on phenology and biology described in peer-reviewed journals or theses. This review provides a solid basis for future in-depth comparative studies. This summary of knowledge will encourage and facilitate continuing research on the pollination dynamics of Ficus and the associated insect fauna in Taiwan.",2015
Interactions between pollinator and non-pollinator fig wasps: correlations between their numbers can be misleading,Agaonidae; Ficus; inquiline; Kradibia; NPFW; parasitoid; Sycoscapter,FICUS-SYCOMORUS; MUTUALISM; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; TREE; OVIPOSITION; DYNAMICS; RESOURCE; SEEDS,"Ficus and their species-specific pollinator fig wasps represent an obligate plant-insect mutualism, but figs also support a community of non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) that consist of phytophages and parasitoids or inquilines. We studied interactions between Kradibia tentacularis, the pollinator of a dioecious fig tree species Ficus montana, and an undescribed NPFWSycoscapter sp. Members of Sycoscapter sp. oviposited 2-4weeks after pollinator oviposition, when host larvae were present in the figs. No negative correlation was found between the numbers of the two wasp species emerging from figs in a semi-natural population. However, in experiments where the numbers of pollinator foundresses entering a fig were controlled, Sycoscapter sp. significantly reduced the numbers of pollinator offspring. Consequently, it can be concluded that Sycoscapter sp. is a parasitoid of K.tentacularis (which may also feed on plant tissue). Sycoscapter females concentrate their oviposition in figs that contain more potential hosts, rendering invalid conclusions based on simple correlations of host and natural enemy numbers.",2015

Phylogenetic relationships of North American species to Asian species were reconstructed by sampling sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the plastid matK region of 28 North American species, collected in the field or sampled from herbarium specimens, and 134 accessions of 102 Asian and three European species, obtained from GenBank. Maximum parsimony (PAUP) and Bayesian (MrBayes) analyses of ITS and combined ITS and matK data reveal two robustly supported monophyletic North American clades derived from Asian ancestors. Biogeographic analysis (S-DIVA) suggests Asia plus Japan, the Cascade Range, or Rocky Mountains as highly probable ancestral areas without involving Beringia for one clade. In the other clade, Asia plus the Rocky Mountains is specified as the most probable ancestral area, but less probable alternatives also include Asia plus Europe, Japan, or Beringia. Once established in North America, dispersal/divergence throughout North America occurred out of Rocky Mountain and/or Cascade Range ancestral centers of distribution. Beringian and European species are derived from North American centers rather than being part of ancestral areas for North American species.",2015
"Reproductive biology of Pentadesma butyracea (Clusiaceae), source of a valuable non timber forest product in Benin",Breeding system; floral synchrony; fruit set; pollination; pollen-ovule ratio; recalcitrant seeds; conservation,SYMPHONIA-GLOBULIFERA CLUSIACEAE; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; RECALCITRANT SEEDS; POPULATION-SIZE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; GENETIC-VARIATION; BREEDING SYSTEMS; FRUIT PRODUCTION,"Background and aims - The main reproductive traits of the native African food tree species, Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (Clusiaceae), which is threatened in Benin and Togo, were examined in Benin to gather basic data necessary to develop conservation strategies in these countries. Methodology - Data were collected on phenological pattern, floral morphology, pollinator assemblage, seed production and germination conditions on 77 adult individuals from three natural populations occurring in the Sudanian phytogeographical zone. Key results - In Benin, Pentadesma butyracea flowers once a year during the dry season from September to December. Flowering entry displayed less variation among populations than among individuals within populations. However, a high synchrony of different floral stages between trees due to a long flowering period (c. 2 months per tree), might still facilitate pollen exchange. Pollen-ovule ratio was 577 213 suggesting facultative xenogamy. The apical position of inflorescences, the yellowish to white greenish flowers and the high quantity of pollen and nectar per flower (1042 +/- 117 mu L) represent floral attractants that predispose the species to animal-pollination. The main pollinators were two sunbirds (Cyanomitra verticalis, Cinnyris coccinigastrus) and three Hymenoptera (Apis mellifera, Meliponula togoensis, Hypotrigona sp.). Mean fruit set reached 49%, and absolute fruit production increased with tree size. Seeds were desiccation-sensitive (i.e. recalcitrant) with a maximum duration of hydrated storage of three months. Germination of seeds was most successful and rapid at 30 degrees C (50% after nine days). Conclusions - Our results indicate that the natural reproduction of P. butyracea is not limited by its ecology so that we hypothesize anthropogenic activities to be the reason for the threatened status of P. butyracea in Benin and Togo. However, due to its recalcitrant seeds, the conservation of its genetic resources is not feasible through ex situ conservation of seed banks but in situ strategies and/or ex situ conservation in orchards should be successful.",2015

Crossman",environmental flows; flow regimes; monitoring; Murray-Darling Basin; statistical analysis; water resource development; wetlands,MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; AUSTRALIA,"Colloff et al. in Marine and Freshwater Research (http:dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF14067) examined time-series data for flow-dependent vegetation, invertebrates, fish, frogs, reptiles and waterbirds in the Murray-Darling Basin, 1905-2013. They concluded that temporal patterns fluctuated, declining during droughts and recovering after floods. They suggested that major changes in land use in the late 19th century permanently modified these freshwater ecosystems, irretrievably degrading them before major water diversions. Restoring water to the environment might then be interpreted as not addressing biotic declines. We argue that their conclusions are inadequately supported, although data quality remains patchy and they neglected the influence of hydrology and the timing and extent of water resource development. We are critical of the lack of adequate model specification and the omission of statistical power analyses. We show that declines of native flow-dependent flora and fauna have continued through the 20th and early 21st centuries, in response to multiple factors, including long-term changes in flow regimes. We argue that flow-regime changes have been critical, but not in isolation. So, returning water to the environment is a prerequisite for sustained recovery but governments need to improve monitoring and analyses to adequately determine effectiveness of management of the rivers and wetlands of the Murray-Darling Basin.",2015

The analysis of flowers provides strong evidence to conclude that the whole surface of lip callus and abaxial side of isthmus are secretory. The exudation at first appears on callus, at early stages, later on isthmus. It could be a strategy to prolong the emission of volatile substances and nectar, and this means to prolong luring pollinators. The results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) support this conclusion. The plastids noted in callus were without starch, whereas the isthmus' cells contained partly hydrolyzed starch. Some plastids, noted in callus, had polymorphic shapes, which were often related to a starch reduction. During the depletion of starch in callus cells, the number of plastoglobuli within the plastids increased, and also lipid bodies appeared in the cytoplasm whereas, in isthmus cells, proplastids with phytoferritin were noted. The endoplasmic reticulum was in contact with plasmalemma, and the vesicles were fusing with plasmalemma in secretory cells of callus and isthmus, which is a way of granulocrine secretion. The cross-sections of sepals revealed that abaxial epidermis was tomentose, with stomata at the top of substomatal cavities. The pollen grains adhering to the rostellum-viscidium prove previous ecological observations that the rostellum-viscidium is not a barrier preventing self-pollination.",2015

The aim of this work was to compare the length, width, centroid size and shape (using a set of shape variables - partal warps) of Iris pumila standards (petals) from an urban area of Belgrade city with data from the Deliblato Sands - an unpolluted nature reserve. Differences between the areas, as well as differences in clonal variability, for length, centroid size (ANOVA p < 0.001) and shape variation of standards were significant (MANOVA p < 0.001). Micro-environmental conditions induced significant diversity between flowers within a clone (p < 0.001), while intra-individual variation (part effects, p > 0.05) was not confirmed. Decrease of standard length and centroid size in the polluted environment was detected, as well as a change in the shape of this Iris pumila flower part. The standards were shorter and wider in the polluted area when compared to those in the unpolluted environment.",2015
Multiple regimes of robust patterns between network structure and biodiversity,,MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; DISENTANGLING NESTEDNESS; INFECTION NETWORKS; STABILITY; ARCHITECTURE; BACTERIA; SYSTEMS,"Ecological networks such as plant-pollinator and host-parasite networks have structured interactions that define who interacts with whom. The structure of interactions also shapes ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Yet, there is significant ongoing debate as to whether certain structures, e.g., nestedness, contribute positively, negatively or not at all to biodiversity. We contend that examining variation in life history traits is key to disentangling the potential relationship between network structure and biodiversity. Here, we do so by analyzing a dynamic model of virus-bacteria interactions across a spectrum of network structures. Consistent with prior studies, we find plausible parameter domains exhibiting strong, positive relationships between nestedness and biodiversity. Yet, the same model can exhibit negative relationships between nestedness and biodiversity when examined in a distinct, plausible region of parameter space. We discuss steps towards identifying when network structure could, on its own, drive the resilience, sustainability, and even conservation of ecological communities.",2015
Remote Sensing and Ecosystem Services: Current Status and Future Opportunities for the Study of Bees and Pollination-Related Services,Ecosystemservices; Remote sensing; Pollination; Bees,,"An unprecedented array of observing systems, coupled with ever increasing computing capacity, makes this a golden era for ecologists to study and quantify ecosystem services using remote sensing technology. Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts. Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity. We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time, and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.",2015
Potential distribution models and the effect of climatic change on the distribution of Phengaris nausithous considering its food plant and host ants,Climate change; Lepidoptera; Papilionoidea; Phengaris nausithous; MaxEnt; Iberian Peninsula,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; LARGE BLUE; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; MACULINEA BUTTERFLIES; LYCAENID BUTTERFLIES; IBERIAN PENINSULA; CONSERVATION; LEPIDOPTERA; RESPONSES,"Climate change has an effect upon the distribution of butterflies, affecting species that are already sensitive due to their specific ecological requirements. This is the case of Phengaris nausithous, an endangered species in the Iberian Peninsula. For its survival, the species needs to become a parasite of one of the two species of the Myrmica ant genus: M. rubra or M. scabrinodis, in whose nests it completes its life cycle. It also needs the presence of the larval host plant, Sanguisorba officinalis. Using the known distribution of P. nausithous in 10 x 10 km UTM squares, we work out the potential distribution of the species and the effect of climate change, using two different scenarios (SRES A2 and B2, which respectively predict 3.4 and 2.4 A degrees C of temperature increase), by modulating it based on the species on which it depends for survival. The obtained models present AUC values (Area Under a Receiver Operating Characteristic-ROC-Curve) above 0.9 in the case of P. nausithous and S. officinalis, and above 0.8 in the case of the host ants, indicating acceptable models. Climatic models show a reduction of the potential distribution area of P. nausithous with both climatic scenarios, and predict as favourable areas in 2080 locations where the species is currently not found, but with presence of its host plant and ants. If this process takes place, an introduction in its favourable areas in the Pyrenees could be considered in order to conserve the species in the future.",2015

This study investigated the nesting ecology and threats to three stingless bee species: Meliponula bocandei (Spinola), Meliponula ferruginea (Lepeletier) and Dactylurina staudingeri (Gribodo) in three landscapes characterized as forest with logging and wild honey hunting; farmlands that experience annual wild fires and a national park. The study was carried out in July 2011 and February 2012. A total of 93 stingless bee nests were found in 48 ha (density 1.9 nests per ha), 81% in tree cavities and 19% in deserted termite mounds and in the ground. M. ferruginea was the only species using deserted termite mounds (seventeen nests) and in the ground (1 nest). Although tree size (diameter at breast height, DBH >15 cm) and density of large tree were important for nest site selection, there was no influence of tree species. M. bocandei may be restricted in choice of nest site in farmland areas by the absence of trees. Reduced availability of trees in agricultural landscape together with bush burning and wild honey collecting is the main threats to stingless bees survival and abundance which need to be addressed for their successful conservation in Ghana.",2015
Pollen-mediated gene flow from transgenic cotton under greenhouse conditions is dependent on different pollinators,,GENETICALLY-MODIFIED CROPS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CROSS-FERTILIZATION; APIS-MELLIFERA; BOMBUS-LUCORUM; HONEY-BEE; GM CROPS; FIELD; PLANT; BEHAVIOR,"With the large-scale release of genetically modified (GM) crops, there are ecological concerns on transgene movement from GM crops to non-GM counterparts and wild relatives. In this research, we conducted greenhouse experiments to measure pollen-mediated gene flow (PGF) in the absence and presence of pollinators (Bombus ignitus, Apis mellifera and Pieris rapae) in one GM cotton (resistant to the insect Helicoverpa armigera and the herbicide glyphosate) and two non-GM lines (Shiyuan321 and Hai7124) during 2012 and 2013. Our results revealed that: (1) PGF varied depending on the pollinator species, and was highest with B. ignitus (10.83%) and lowest with P. rapae (2.71%); (2) PGF with B. ignitus depended on the distance between GM and non-GM cottons; (3) total PGF to Shiyuan321 (8.61%) was higher than to Hai7124 (4.10%). To confirm gene flow, we tested hybrids carrying transgenes for their resistance to glyphosate and H. armigera, and most hybrids showed strong resistance to the herbicide and insect. Our research confirmed that PGF depended on pollinator species, distance between plants and the receptor plant.",2015

The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Native to Britain, O. sphegodes used to be more widely distributed throughout south-eastern England, but is now mainly restricted to the counties of Dorset, East Sussex and Kent. It is widespread throughout the western parts of central and southern Europe, and is common in Spain, France and Italy. Further east, it occurs in Bulgaria and Greece, including most of the Mediterranean islands, and extends into southern Russia, Turkey and northern Iran.Ophrys sphegodes grows on calcareous, nutrient-poor substrates and rarely under any shade. It is most common in ancient, heavily grazed grassland on chalk and Jurassic limestone, but it also occurs in disturbed habitats, horizontally oriented rock floors in limestone quarries, on old limestone quarry spoil heaps, and in lightly trampled calcareous grasslands on maritime cliffs.Ophrys sphegodes multiplies predominantly by sexual reproduction. Vegetative multiplication occasionally occurs through survival or splitting of the old tuber. In the UK, the species is almost exclusively pollinated by males of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea. Male bees are attracted by complex floral bouquets emitted by the flowers that strongly resemble pheromones produced by female A.nigroaenea. Fruit production is generally low, and in most populations, <15% of the flowers produce capsules.Ophrys sphegodes is reproductively isolated from other species in the genus by strong pre-mating barriers, most notably temporal (differences in flowering time) and floral (different pollinators) isolation. In particular, differences in floral odour appear to underlie floral isolation. Nonetheless, several hybrids involving O.sphegodes have been described in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The range of O.sphegodes in Britain declined dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to its extinction in twelve vice-counties. Losses were mainly due to ploughing of grassland and changes in fertilizer and grazing regimes. Its range has increased somewhat in recent years. However, increases in spring temperature due to climate warming may seriously threaten the species in Britain by disrupting the close relationship between O.sphegodes flowering time and the phenology of flight of its prime pollinator, leading to reproductive failure.",2015

In the present study, we conducted a range-wide field investigation of five Pedicularis species of P. sect. Cyathophora, which includes all four basic corolla types present in the genus. We reconstructed the phylogeny of this section by using three single/low-copy nuclear genes (CRC, LFY-L, LFY-S) and two chloroplast genes (matK, ycf1). To clarify the evolutionary history of sect. Cyathophora, we also estimated divergence times of the genus Pedicularis. Additionally, we evaluated the phylogenetic utility of nrDNA ITS in sect. Cyathophora by cloning and sequencing analyses of the ITS region for all of the investigated samples. The results of our multilocus phylogenetic analysis supported the delimitation of three species of sect. Cyathophora, but failed to support the definition of P. rex and P. thamnophila. On the basis of morphological, geographic, genetic, and phylogenetic evidence, we suggest to include P. thamnophila in P. rex. The molecular dating analysis showed that the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and climatic changes may have played important roles in the divergence and speciation of sect. Cyathophora. The results of clone-based sequencing revealed that extensive nrITS polymorphisms exist in the individuals of ingroups; these polymorphisms may cause misleading phylogenetic inference for sect. Cyathophora.",2015
Assessment of Genetic Diversity and Population Genetic Structure of Corylus mandshurica in China Using SSR Markers,,AVELLANA L. CULTIVARS; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; LINKAGE MAP; HAZELNUT; FLOW; SOFTWARE; TRANSFERABILITY; GERMPLASM; DISTANCE; ALLELES,"Corylus mandshurica, also known as pilose hazelnut, is an economically and ecologically important species in China. In this study, ten polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were applied to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of 348 C. mandshurica individuals among 12 populations in China. The SSR markers expressed a relatively high level of genetic diversity (Na = 15.3, Ne = 5.6604, I = 1.8853, Ho = 0.6668, and He = 0.7777). According to the coefficient of genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.1215), genetic variation within the populations (87.85%) were remarkably higher than among populations (12.15%). The average gene flow (Nm = 1.8080) significantly impacts the genetic structure of C. mandshurica populations. The relatively high gene flow (Nm = 1.8080) among wild C. mandshurica may be caused by wind-pollinated flowers, highly nutritious seeds and self-incompatible mating system. The UPGMA (unweighted pair group method of arithmetic averages) dendrogram was divided into two main clusters. Moreover, the results of STRUCTURE analysis suggested that C. mandshurica populations fell into two main clusters. Comparison of the UPGMA dendrogram and the Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis showed general agreement between the population subdivisions and the genetic relationships among populations of C. mandshurica. Group I accessions were located in Northeast China, while Group II accessions were in North China. It is worth noting that a number of genetically similar populations were located in the same geographic region. The results further showed that there was obvious genetic differentiation among populations from Northeast China to North China. Results from the Mantel test showed a weak but still significant positive correlation between Nei's genetic distance and geographic distance (km) among populations (r = 0.419, P = 0.005), suggesting that genetic differentiation in the 12 C. mandshurica populations might be related to geographic distance. These data provide comprehensive information for the development of conservation strategies of these valuable hazelnut resources.",2015

We examined the influence of the breeding system on primary seed dormancy in Hypericum elodes, an Atlantic-European softwater pools specialist plant that exhibits a mixed mating strategy (the ability to both self- and cross-pollinate) to set seeds. Seeds were obtained through hand pollination treatments performed in a natural population during three consecutive years. Primary dormancy of seeds recovered from each pollination treatment was measured by analysing the seed germination response at dispersal and after various periods of cold stratification. While all collected seeds exhibited physiological dormancy, the degree of primary dormancy was associated with the pollination treatments. Weak and rapid loss of primary dormancy characterized seeds recovered from self-pollinated flowers, while stronger dormancy was found in seeds obtained from cross-pollination. The association between pollination treatments and primary dormancy indicated that the mating system should be considered as a source of variation for dormancy degree, proportional to self- and cross-pollinations (selfing rate) within populations of this species. These results suggest that by shedding seeds with various degrees of dormancy, plants may distribute their offspring across time by means of polymorphism in germination response. We conclude that seed germination alone is not an appropriate fitness measure for inbreeding depression estimates, unless dormancy is removed.",2015

PERS; ASTERACEAE; COMPONENTS; HYDRODISTILLATION; CELLS,"The Baccharis genus has more than 400 species of aromatic plants. However, only approximately 50 species have been studied in oil composition to date. From these studies, very few take into consideration differences between male and female plants, which is a significant and distinctive factor in Baccharis in the Asteraceae family. Baccharis articulata is a common shrub that grows wild in south Brazil, northern and central Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. It is considered to be a medicinal plant and is employed in traditional medicine. We report B. articulata male and female volatile composition obtained by simultaneous distillation-extraction technique and analyzed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Also, an assessment of aromatic differences between volatile extracts was evaluated by gas chromatography with olfactometry. The results show a very similar chemical composition between male and female extracts, with a high proportion of terpene compounds of which beta-pinene, limonene and germacrene D are the main components. Despite the chemical similarity, great differences in aromatic profile were found: male plant samples exhibited the strongest odorants in number and intensity of aromatic attributes. These differences explain field observations which indicate differences between male and female flower aroma, and might be of ecological significance in the attraction of pollinating insects.",2015

In a field experiment, E. scaber populations sourced from agro-ecologically diverse sites in south-eastern Australia, were subjected to three irrigation treatments to test their level of summer dormancy. The tillering reaction to opportunistic summer moisture was the same across all populations and suggests that summer dormancy is facultative in populations of E. scaber, rather than complete as previously reported. Using E. scaber as a pollen source, attempts were made to fertilise 16 wheat cultivars, used as emasculated female parents. Two rescue techniques were used to recover immature embryos at 24-48 h and 14 days post-pollination. Pollinated wheat spikes showed high proportions of early seed set, indicating fertilisation was taking place, however embryo recovery was very low. Several putative hybrid plants were recovered from both rescue techniques. PCR testing of the recovered plants was unable to detect E. scaber DNA and surviving plants were entirely like the wheat parent and fully fertile, suggesting either these plants were the result of rare self-pollination or doubled haploids following E. scaber chromosome elimination. The short lived nature of E. scaber along with challenges associated with crossing this species to wheat, has led the authors to conclude that E. scaber is not a priority candidate to be used as a perennial donor species in perennial grain development.",2015
"Wind-mediated horseweed (Conyza canadensis) gene flow: pollen emission, dispersion, and deposition",Atmosphere; deposition; dispersion; emission; horseweed; pollen; source strength,METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS; SEED DISPERSAL; MAIZE POLLEN; ATMOSPHERE; AUSTRALIA; LONDON; CORN,"Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) is a problem weed in crop production because of its evolved resistance to glyphosate and other herbicides. Although horseweed is mainly self-pollinating, glyphosate-resistant (GR) horseweed can pollinate glyphosate-susceptible (GS) horseweed. To the best of our knowledge, however, there are no available data on horseweed pollen production, dispersion, and deposition relative to gene flow and the evolution of resistance. To help fill this knowledge gap, a 43-day field study was performed in Champaign, Illinois, USA in 2013 to characterize horseweed atmospheric pollen emission, dispersion, and deposition. Pollen concentration and deposition, coupled with atmospheric data, were measured in a source field (180 m by 46 m) and its surrounding areas up to 1 km downwind horizontally and up to 100 m vertically. The source strength (emission rate) ranged from 0 to 140 pollen grains per plant per second (1170 to 2.1x10(6) per plant per day). For the life of the study, the estimated number of pollen grains generated from this source field was 10.5x10(10) (2.3x10(6) per plant). The release of horseweed pollen was not strongly correlated to meteorological data and may be mainly determined by horseweed physiology. Horseweed pollen reached heights of 80 to100 m, making long-distance transport possible. Normalized (by source data) pollen deposition with distance followed a negative-power exponential curve. Normalized pollen deposition was 2.5% even at 480 m downwind from the source edge. Correlation analysis showed that close to or inside the source field at lower heights (3 m) vertical transport was related to vertical wind speed, while horizontal pollen transport was related to horizontal wind speed. High relative humidity prevented pollen transport at greater heights (3-100 m) and longer distances (0-1000 m) from the source. This study can contribute to the understanding of how herbicide-resistance weeds or invasive plants affect ecology through wind-mediated pollination and invasion.",2015

For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded information about nest location, and monitored nest survival. For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested that factors other than invasion were responsible for network changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological networks may be more challenging than anticipated.",2015
"Modern pollen vegetation relationships in a dry deciduous monsoon forest: A case study from Lonar Crater Lake, central India",Tropical dry deciduous forests; Modern pollen/vegetation relationships; Lonar Lake; Central India,SOURCE AREA; SURFACE SAMPLES; SOUTHERN INDIA; REPRESENTATION; SEDIMENTS; PHENOLOGY; ECOLOGY; RAIN; POLLINATION; ECOSYSTEMS,"As part of ongoing research on Holocene lacustrine sediments of Lonar Crater Lake (central India), pollen assemblages in lake surface sediment and soil samples were studied to unravel pollenevegetation relationships, including pollen transport processes in tropical dry deciduous forest vegetation. Furthermore, palynological results were compared with geochemical proxies and spatial features of the lake sediments and the vegetation. The obtained data reveal strong differences in pollen assemblages and pollen concentrations between and within the studied trapping media. Local arboreal vegetation is adequately represented in the soil samples, but is less represented in the lake surface sediment samples. The composition of the lacustrine pollen assemblages is mainly influenced by patterns of transport through surface and channel runoff. Besides the relevance of our new data for reliable interpretation of fossil pollen spectra extracted from Lonar sediment cores, the results of this study are of general importance for the understanding of Quaternary pollen assemblages from tropical lacustrine archives, as well as for the implementation and selection of suitable approaches for quantitative pollen based environmental reconstructions in south Asia and beyond.

In the case of mutualistic webs, like plant-pollinator networks, advances in understanding species abundances are currently limited, mainly owing to the lack of methodological tools to deal with the intrinsic complexity of mutualisms. Here, we propose an aggregation method leading to a simple compartmental mutualistic population model that captures both qualitatively and quantitatively the size-segregated populations observed in a Mediterranean community of nectar-producing plant species and nectar-searching animal species. We analyse the issue of optimal aggregation level and its connection with the trade-off between realism and overparametrization. We show that aggregation of both plants and pollinators into five size classes or compartments leads to a robust model with only two tunable parameters. Moreover, if, in each compartment, (i) the interaction coefficients fulfil the condition of weak mutualism and (ii) the mutualism is facultative for at least one party of the compartment, then the interactions between different compartments are sufficient to guarantee global stability of the equilibrium population.",2015
FORAGES AND PASTURES SYMPOSIUM: Improving soil health and productivity on grasslands using managed grazing of livestock,biodiversity; ecological services; grazing; organic matter; soil; water,CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM; PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; SOUTHERN PIEDMONT USA; ORGANIC-CARBON SEQUESTRATION; GREENHOUSE-GAS CONTRIBUTIONS; GREAT-PLAINS GRASSLANDS; BULK-DENSITY; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; WATER INFILTRATION; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE,"Beyond grazing, managed grasslands provide ecological services that may offer economic incentives for multifunctional use. Increasing biodiversity of plant communities may maximize net primary production by optimizing utilization of available light, water, and nutrient resources; enhance production stability in response to climatic stress; reduce invasion of exotic species; increase soil OM; reduce nutrient leaching or loading in surface runoff; and provide wildlife habitat. Strategically managed grazing may increase biodiversity of cool-season pastures by creating disturbance in plant communities through herbivory, treading, nutrient cycling, and plant seed dispersal. Soil OM will increase carbon and nutrient sequestration and water-holding capacity of soils and is greater in grazed pastures than nongrazed grasslands or land used for row crop or hay production. However, results of studies evaluating the effects of different grazing management systems on soil OM are limited and inconsistent. Although roots and organic residues of pasture forages create soil macropores that reduce soil compaction, grazing has increased soil bulk density or penetration resistance regardless of stocking rates or systems. But the effects of the duration of grazing and rest periods on soil compaction need further evaluation. Because vegetative cover dissipates the energy of falling raindrops and plant stems and tillers reduce the rate of surface water flow, managing grazing to maintain adequate vegetative cover will minimize the effects of treading on water infiltration in both upland and riparian locations. Through increased diversity of the plant community with alterations of habitat structure, grazing systems can be developed that enhance habitat for wildlife and insect pollinators. Although grazing management may enhance the ecological services provided by grasslands, environmental responses are controlled by variations in climate, soil, landscape position, and plant community resulting in considerable spatial and temporal variation in the responses. Furthermore, a single grazing management system may not maximize livestock productivity and each of the potential ecological services provided by grasslands. Therefore, production and ecological goals must be integrated to identify the optimal grazing management system.",2015
FLORAL COST VS. FLORAL DISPLAY: INSIGHTS FROM THE MEGADIVERSE MYRTALES SUGGEST THAT ENERGETICALLY EXPENSIVE FLORAL PARTS ARE LESS PHYLOGENETICALLY CONSTRAINED,evolution; flower diameter; floral display; Myrtales; phylogenetic signal; trade-off,SILENE-LATIFOLIA CARYOPHYLLACEAE; EICHHORNIA-PANICULATA PONTEDERIACEAE; FLOWER SIZE; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; SEXUAL DIMORPHISM; INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; WILD RADISH; POLLINATION,"Premise of the study: Floral display describes the effect of flower size combined with the number of flowers per inflorescence. There is strong evidence that a floral-display trade-off operates under energetic constraint, with few-flowered inflorescences likely to have larger flowers than many-flowered inflorescences. Flower size can be estimated by different variables; thus, we propose that the variable for flower size that is most highly (negatively) correlated with the number of flowers per inflorescence will also be the best estimate of floral cost. Ranking the correlation with the phylogenetic signal of the variable can provide additional insight into the evolution of floral display. Methods: The Myrtales were chosen as a model order based on age, worldwide distribution, and diversity of reproductive strategies. Ninety-nine species representing all families and one quarter of generic diversity across its geographic and ecological range were sampled to reconstruct a phylogeny based on rbcL and ndhF sequences. Correlation coefficients were calculated for flower size variables vs. the number of flowers per inflorescence. Phylogenetic signal was measured for all variables and for floral display. Key results: Flowers per inflorescence showed significant negative correlation with the following flower size variables (weakest to strongest): filament length < anther size < flower depth < flower diameter. As the correlation of each character with number of flowers per inflorescence rose (suggesting increased cost), the values for phylogenetic signal diminished (suggesting less constraint). Conclusions: We conclude that energetically costly floral characters appear to be less phylogenetically constrained, while low-cost floral characters maintain higher levels of phylogenetic inertia.",2015
The consequences of multiple indirect pathways of interaction for species coexistence,Apparent competition; Food web module; Indirect effects; Interaction strength; Mutualism; Network; Predation; Resource competition,ECOLOGICAL INTERACTION NETWORKS; APPARENT COMPETITION; FOOD-WEB; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TENDING ANTS; MUTUALISM; POLLINATION; PREDATION; ECOSYSTEMS,"Species in diverse communities typically have direct interactions with a small subset of other species, yet indirect effects can be traced between all of the species in a community. When multiple pathways of indirect effects link a pair of species, the magnitude and sign of the net effects depend on the details of the links in each indirect pathway. We explore the effects of alternative indirect pathways in a food web module that includes predation, competition, and mutualistic interactions; mutualisms are an important component of natural interaction networks, but are underrepresented in theoretical studies of indirect interactions. We use a conjugate variable method to partition the strength of a net indirect effect between two species that do not directly interact into two partial effects transmitted along two separate but simultaneously acting pathways: a pathway mediated by a shared predator and a pathway mediated by competing resources. Though the sign of each partial effect is generally negative, as expected, the strengths of the partial effects are different than if they occurred in isolation of one another. Summing the purely predator-mediated indirect effect and the purely resource-mediated indirect effect does not yield the net effect when they occur together. We find that when a resource-mediated pathway for an indirect effect is present, the presence of a shared predator can facilitate coexistence between apparent competitors, even allowing for the persistence of the species more vulnerable to predation. This approach holds promise for building a better understanding of the ways that indirect effects propagate through communities to affect patterns of relative abundance and coexistence.",2015
A spatially explicit model for flowering time in bamboos: long rhizomes drive the evolution of delayed flowering,clonal monocarpy; evolutionarily stable strategy; geographic cline; kin competition; lattice modelling; mass flowering; reproductive ecology; rhizome system; spatial structure,INBREEDING DEPRESSION; VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; GENETIC LOAD; PLANTS; SIZE; DISPERSAL; DENSITY; STRATEGIES; HABITATS,"Clonal plants produce semi-autonomous modules (ramets). The spatial distribution of ramets affects lifetime reproductive success via self-pollination, kin competition and competition among genotypes over space and nutrients. These, in turn, influence the evolution of the timing of flowering in monocarps (flowering is fatal), such as bamboos. The vegetative growth period (flowering interval) in bamboos shows a geographic cline from tropical (short-interval) to temperate (long-interval) regions. However, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of this geographic trend in flowering interval remain elusive. We hypothesized that differences in flowering interval are determined by ecological features that affect the spatial arrangement of ramets and the degree of kin competition. Using a spatially explicit mathematical model, we examined the effects of rhizome elongation, seed and pollen dispersal ranges and inbreeding depression on the evolution of flowering interval. Flowering interval became longer as rhizome length increased but was shorter as seed dispersal range increased. However, flowering interval was less affected when these ranges were extremely large. These results could be caused by intragenet competition due to the spatial structure of genets. If the rhizome is short, each genet forms a clumping structure by vegetative growth and is subject to high intragenet competition. Early flowering may reduce this competition. When seed dispersal range is shorter, kin competition among seeds becomes greater and delayed flowering is a better strategy. When these parameters are extremely large, the effects of this type of competition are reduced, and flowering interval does not change. The effect of inbreeding depression depends on the spatial distribution of ramets formed by vegetative growth. Inbreeding depression reduces reproductive success, and hence, delayed flowering is selected for when both rhizome length and pollen dispersal range are short, and inbreeding with neighbouring siblings is unavoidable.Synthesis. The evolutionary consequences of flowering interval in clonal plants are affected by the spatial distribution of genets. Geographic patterns in flowering interval of bamboos can be explained by differences in rhizome length. Interspecific comparisons among species with different rhizome lengths should be examined by collecting long-term demographic data on the spatial arrangement of ramets.",2015
OPTICAL SECTIONING AND 3D RECONSTRUCTIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY FOR ANALYSIS OF CELL SHAPE,confocal microscopy; fluorescence; morphology; optical sectioning; petal cells,CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY; CUTICULAR SURFACES; ANTIRRHINUM-MAJUS; PLANT SURFACES; EVOLUTION; PETALS; MICROMORPHOLOGY; LEGUMINOSAE; POLLINATION,"Premise of the study: Visualizing flower epidermal cells is often desirable for investigating the interaction between flowers and their pollinators, in addition to the broader range of ecological interactions in which flowers are involved. We developed a protocol for visualizing petal epidermal cells without the limitations of the commonly used method of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Methods: Flower material was collected and fixed in glutaraldehyde, followed by dehydration in an ethanol series. Flowers were dissected to collect petals, and subjected to a Histo-Clear series to remove the cuticle. Material was then stained with aniline blue, mounted on microscope slides, and imaged using a compound fluorescence microscope to obtain optical sections that were reconstructed into a 3D image. Results: This optical sectioning method yielded high-quality images of the petal epidermal cells with virtually no damage to cells. Flowers were processed in larger batches than are possible using common SEM methods. Also, flower size was not a limiting factor as often observed in SEM studies. Flowers up to 5 cm in length were processed and mounted for visualization. Conclusions: This method requires no special equipment for sample preparation prior to imaging and should be seen as an alternative method to SEM.",2015
Stylar polymorphism on the edge: unusual flower traits in Moroccan Narcissus broussonetii (Amaryllidaceae),heterostyly; morph ratio; perianth traits; pollinators; self-incompatibility; stigma-height dimorphism,FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; STIGMA-HEIGHT DIMORPHISM; MORPH-RATIO VARIATION; PAPYRACEUS AMARYLLIDACEAE; TRIANDRUS AMARYLLIDACEAE; BREEDING SYSTEMS; FLORAL VARIATION; TONGUED INSECTS; POLLEN TRANSFER; TAZETTA L,"Heterostyly and related polymorphisms (e.g. stigma-height dimorphism) have been used as model systems for studying the origin and maintenance of plant population variability. Stigma-height dimorphism frequently occurs in Narcissus and is associated with a particular flower shape. In the present study, we describe a new, peculiar case of stigma-height dimorphism in Narcissus broussonetii, a species on the margin of the geographical distribution of the genus. We determined the stylar condition of N. broussonetii and its variation across populations, analyzed perianth morphology and its relationship with stylar variation, and compared this species with other stylar dimorphic species of the genus. We also studied the incompatibility system and pollination ecology of the species. Narcissus broussonetii is a style-dimorphic species, as suggested in early studies that were subsequently neglected, and displays unusual flower morphology, with a long floral tube and a virtual absence of a corona. The species shows a late-(ovarian) acting incompatibility system and crosses within and between morphs are fertile. We observed short-tongued diurnal and long-tongued nocturnal pollinators. Our findings confirm that the presence of the observed dimorphism across populations is most probably the result of the joint action of a nonheteromorphic incompatibility system, extremely long and narrow floral tubes, and a combined role of short-and long-tongued pollinators.",2015
Mismatch in the distribution of floral ecotypes and pollinators: insights into the evolution of sexually deceptive orchids,Drakaea concolor; ecotype; floral odour; microsatellites; orchid; pollination; population genetics; rare; speciation,AUSTRALIAN FLORISTIC REGION; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CALADENIA ORCHIDACEAE; OPHRYS ORCHIDACEAE; DRIVEN SPECIATION; WASP POLLINATORS; ODOR CHEMISTRY; SOUTH-AFRICA; SPUR LENGTH,"Plants are predicted to show floral adaptation to geographic variation in the most effective pollinator, potentially leading to reproductive isolation and genetic divergence. Many sexually deceptive orchids attract just a single pollinator species, limiting opportunities to experimentally investigate pollinator switching. Here, we investigate Drakaea concolor, which attracts two pollinator species. Using pollinator choice tests, we detected two morphologically similar ecotypes within D.concolor. The common ecotype only attracted Zaspilothynnus gilesi, whereas the rare ecotype also attracted an undescribed species of Pogonothynnus. The rare ecotype occurred at populations nested within the distribution of the common ecotype, with no evidence of ecotypes occurring sympatrically. Surveying for pollinators at over 100 sites revealed that ecotype identity was not correlated with wasp availability, with most orchid populations only attracting the rare Z.gilesi. Using microsatellite markers, genetic differentiation among populations was very low (G(ST) = 0.011) regardless of ecotype, suggestive of frequent gene flow. Taken together, these results may indicate that the ability to attract Pogonothynnus has evolved recently, but this ecotype is yet to spread. The nested distribution of ecotypes, rather than the more typical formation of ecotypes in allopatry, illustrates that in sexually deceptive orchids, pollinator switching could occur throughout a species' range, resulting from multiple potentially suitable but unexploited pollinators occurring in sympatry. This unusual case of sympatric pollinators highlights D.concolor as a promising study system for further understanding the process of pollinator switching from ecological, chemical and genetic perspectives.",2015
Pollen transfer efficiency and its effect on inflorescence size in deceptive pollination strategies,Flower number; food deception; inflorescence size; orchids; pollen loss; resource allocation; sexual deception,SEXUAL DECEPTION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; FLORAL ISOLATION; ORCHIDACEAE; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; SPECIATION; NECTAR; BEES; DIVERSIFICATION,"Pollination systems differ in pollen transfer efficiency, a variable that may influence the evolution of flower number. Here we apply a comparative approach to examine the link between pollen transfer efficiency and the evolution of inflorescence size in food and sexually deceptive orchids. We examined pollination performance in nine food-deceptive, and eight sexually deceptive orchids by recording pollen removal and deposition in the field. We calculated correlations between reproductive success and flower number (as a proxy for resources allocated during reproductive process), and directional selection differentials were estimated on flower number for four species. Results indicate that sexually deceptive species experience decreased pollen loss compared to food-deceptive species. Despite producing fewer flowers, sexually deceptive species attained levels of overall pollination success (through male and female function) similar to food-deceptive species. Furthermore, a positive correlation between flower number and pollination success was observed in food-deceptive species, but this correlation was not detected in sexually deceptive species. Directional selection differentials for flower number were significantly higher in food compared to sexually deceptive species. We suggest that pollination systems with more efficient pollen transfer and no correlation between pollination success and number of flowers produced, such as sexual deception, may allow the production of inflorescences with fewer flowers that permit the plant to allocate fewer resources to floral displays and, at the same time, limit transpiration. This strategy can be particularly important for ecological success in Mediterranean water-deprived habitats, and might explain the high frequency of sexually deceptive species in these specialised ecosystems.",2015
Simultaneous pulsed flowering in a temperate legume: causes and consequences of multimodality in the shape of floral display schedules,Chamaecrista fasciculata; floral longevity; flower deployment; individual synchrony; phenological assortative mating; population synchrony; reproductive ecology,CHAMAECRISTA-FASCICULATA LEGUMINOSAE; MIRROR-IMAGE FLOWERS; CASSIA-FASCICULATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT PHENOLOGY; FRUIT-SET; LONGEVITY; TIME; POLLINATION; SYNCHRONY,"In plants, the temporal pattern of floral displays, or display schedules, delimits an individual's mating opportunities. Thus, variation in the shape of display schedules can affect the degree of population synchrony and the strength of phenological assortative mating by flowering onset date. A good understanding of the mechanisms regulating the timing of flowering onset has been developed, but we know less about factors influencing subsequent patterns of floral display. We observed unusual multimodal display schedules in temperate populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata. Here, we ask whether flowering pulses' are simultaneous among individuals and populations and explore potential underlying mechanisms and consequences of pulsed flowering. We monitored daily flower production for individual plants from genetically divergent populations during a series of field experiments that manipulated three potential influencers of display schedule shape: average daily temperature, pollinator availability and watering schedules. We measured floral longevity to isolate the contributions of flower retention and flower deployment to display schedules. We assessed relationships between flowering and environmental variables and compared estimates of population synchrony, individual synchrony and the strength of assortative mating with those of 29 unimodally flowering species from the area. We observed simultaneous flowering pulses in all experiments, with peaks aligned among individuals and populations despite variation in flowering onset and/or duration. Pulses were not the result of increases in average temperature, pollinator availability or variation in watering schedules. Seasonal fluctuations in temperature correlated with floral longevity and flower deployment, suggesting that the shape of display schedules may be plastic in response to fluctuations in temperature. Average population and individual synchrony differed only slightly from those of the species with unimodal schedules, while the average strength of assortative mating for flowering onset date was strongly reduced (0.21 in C. fasciculata vs. 0.35 for the 29 other species). Synthesis. Researchers should take caution in assuming that components of display schedules are genetically or developmentally correlated with flowering onset. Variation in the shape of display schedules can influence patterns of gene flow within or between populations, with potential effects on the strength of phenological assortative mating and subsequent responses to selection.",2015

We used long-term data and a fire and canopy alteration experiment with controls to address our hypothesis that turkeybeard is fire-adapted. Analyses of a primary study population demonstrated that turkeybeard is a long-lived, infrequently flowering perennial with high survival and rapid postfire resprouting ability. Experimental responses showed that population-level flowering and inflorescence production increased 60-280% across treatments compared to controls in two posttreatment seasons. Seed production/inflorescence was significantly higher in treated plants. Fire and canopy removal treatments had a positive and additive effect on seed set compared to controls. Additional population surveys and pollination experiments showed that turkeybeard exhibited low flowering levels in undisturbed forest and required outcrossing for good seed set. Burning released plants from these limiting factors by inducing mass-flowering and altering the forest habitat to attract insect pollinators. Our research demonstrates that turkeybeard is one of the few known definitively fire-adapted montane forest understory herbs in the eastern United States, such that fire management including prescribed burning is recommended for its conservation and management. It also adds new impetus for studying fire's ecological role in these lands.",2015

We aimed to analyse the consequences of management on population genetics and compared information from different markers to analyse ecological and evolutionary aspects of incipient domestication and genetic resources conservation. Eight populations were evaluated using seven microsatellite loci and 15 allozyme loci. SSR identified higher genetic diversity (A = 5.6, p = 98.2, H-E = 0.651) than allozymes (A(r) = 2.6, p = 93.3, H-E = 0.479). Both marker types identified that H-O and H-E were higher in wild populations (SSR: H-O = 0.730; H-E = 0.677; allozymes: H-O = 0.432; H-E = 0.481) than in the managed ones (SSR: H-O = 0.652; H-E = 0.616; allozymes: H-O = 0.417; H-E = 0.474), but differences were significant only analysed by SSR. SSR identified 3 % of genetic structure between wild and managed populations and 10 % among populations (I center dot(PR) = 0.099), a much lower estimate than with allozymes (I center dot(PR) = 0.208). The results suggest that management has had only slight consequences on the population genetics of P. chende. Artificial selection operates at low intensity and life history traits of the species, particularly the self-incompatible breeding system, pollination by bees and seed dispersion by birds, bats and humans favour high genetic diversity and gene flow. SSR detect finer genetic variation than allozymes, but both marker types provide similar patterns of information useful for analysing population genetics.",2015

Private gardens, urban parks or green roofs may support relatively high densities of diverse wild bees. Knowledge is lacking regarding bee assemblages in Paris, the French capital, and one of the most densely populated part of France. In this context, we here provide a first assessment of the taxonomic and functional composition of bee assemblages in three urban parks in downtown Paris. Bees were sampled with a set of three coloured pan traps per park. Fifteen 24-hour sessions were performed from April to July 2011. We captured 425 specimens from 44 species representing five families and 11 genera. The assemblage was dominated by Halictidae (15 species representing 70.1% of total abundance), especially the eusocial species Lasioglossum morio that made 25.2% of total abundance. From a functional point of view, there were only two species of parasitic bees that made 1.2% of total abundance. Most non-parasitic species were polylectic and below-ground nesting. This study highlights the importance of preserving and managing urban parks and other green areas to promote the conservation of wild bees and ultimately the functionality of pollination service in urban ecosystems.",2015

We compared four quality measures-seed number, abortion, viability and germination. To test as wide a span of seed variability as possible, we cross-pollinated and self-pollinated one nectarless and one nectar-rewarding orchid species, assuming that nectariferous species should be more adapted to geitonogamous selfing than the cheating one and that seed quality should reflect that. Seed number for both species was lowest in selfed fruits. Viability and germination did not show any difference in deceptive Orchis militaris treatments, but the trend was different in rewarding Platanthera bifolia. Seed number and seed abortion correlated well as did viability and germination in vitro. This shows that these two stages are controlled by different mechanisms. Therefore, seed number or seed abortion rate alone cannot be proxies for reproductive output.",2015
Addressing complexity and uncertainty: conceptual models and expert judgments applied to migratory birds in the oil sands of Canada,complexity; conceptual modeling; expert judgment; migratory birds; oil sands; uncertainty,BOREAL MIXEDWOOD FOREST; SPRUCE BUDWORM; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; AVIAN COMMUNITIES; NEST PREDATION; ANNUAL-CYCLE; HABITAT; FRAGMENTATION; ALBERTA,"Complexity and uncertainty are inherent in social-ecological systems. Although they can create challenges for scientists and decision makers, they cannot be a reason for delaying decision making. Two strategies have matured in recent decades to address these challenges. Systems thinking, as embodied by conceptual modeling, is a holistic approach in which a system can be better understood by examining it as a whole. Expert elicitation represents a second strategy that enables a greater diversity of inputs to understand complex systems. We explored the use of conceptual models and expert judgments to inform expansion of monitoring around oil sands development in northern Alberta, Canada, particularly related to migratory forest birds. This study area is a complex social-ecological system for which there is an abundance of specific information, but a relatively weak understanding about system behavior. Multiple conceptual models were developed to represent complexity and provide a more fulsome view of influences across the landscape. A hierarchical approach proved useful, and a mechanistic structure of the models clarified the cumulative and interactive nature of factors within and outside the study area. To address gaps in understanding, expert judgments were integrated using a series of structured exercises to derive ""weightings"" of importance of different components in the conceptual models, specifically pairwise comparisons, Likert scaling, and a maximum difference conjoint approach. These exercises were helpful for discriminating the importance of different influences and illuminating the competing beliefs of experts. Various supporting tools helped us engage a group of experts from across North America, which included a virtual meeting, online polling, desktop sharing, web survey, and financial incentive. This combination of techniques was innovative and proved useful for addressing complexity and uncertainty in a specific natural resource management setting, which can be informative for others facing similar challenges.",2015

The role of pollen limitation in influencing the early development of an invasion is explored in order to gain a greater understanding of the mechanistic basis for an apparent Allee effect (causal relationship between population size/density and mean individual fitness) observed in populations of invasive Spartina species: The model is used to explore how various factors such as atmospheric stability, wind direction/speed, pollen characteristics and spatial structure of the population affect the overall invasion dynamics and reproductive success. Comparisons were also made between invasive species of Spartina (S. alterniflora, S. anglica) and a non-invasive species (S. foliosa), showing a reduced Allee effect was associated with invasion success. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn here may give insights into some of the fundamental processes affecting the growth and population dynamics of other invasive wind-pollinated plants.",2015

We assume that vectors, due to their specific requirements, act at different spatial scales and seed-vector interactions might differ greatly between landscapes. So far, it remains largely unclear, how the interaction between seeds and their vectors affects the degree of seed predation and dispersal in novel anthropogenic landscapes. We expect changes in patterns either at the landscape scale (urban vs rural areas), habitat scale (habitat heterogeneity) or microhabitat scale (vegetation variability). We assessed seed predation and dispersal of two seed species by rodents, earthworms, other invertebrates and rain in cafeteria experiments in urban gardens and rural field margins and implemented generalized mixed effect models to test the effect of spatial scales and other environmental variables. Seed predation and dispersal were generally low and similar patterns emerged when he same vector facilitated the function. Overall, predation and dispersal were similar in urban and rural areas but when differentiating between vectors, scale effects were 'dent. Seed predation by rodents and earthworms was affected at the landscape scale, seed predation by other invertebrates increased with higher habitat heterogeneity and seed dispersal by rain was negatively affected at the microhabitat scale through increased plant cover. We show that one vector can facilitate the contrasting two functions, seed predation and dispersal, simultaneously, resulting in similar patterns at a specific spatial scale however, different vectors might lead to contrasting patterns for the same function, depending on the spatial scale. This needs to be considered especially in anthropogenic areas, where ecosystem management decisions are also made at different spatial scales from private garden owners to landscape planning committees.",2015
Exotic gene flow affects fitness trait values but not levels of heritable trait variation in the southernmost population of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. var. nevadensis),Conservation genetics; Genetic variation; Heritability; Hybridization; Introgression; Translocations,GENETICALLY-MODIFIED CROPS; OUTBREEDING DEPRESSION; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ESTABLISHMENT SUCCESS; POSTGLACIAL HISTORY; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; WILD POPULATIONS; POLLEN DISPERSAL; MARITIME PINE; HYBRIDIZATION,"Large-scale human-mediated translocation of plants is a widespread phenomenon throughout the world. In this study, we examine the extent to which exotic gene flow from conspecific plantations of mesic origin impacts pre- and post-dispersal fitness, seedling phenotype, and quantitative genetic variation of the relict southernmost native population of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris var. nevadensis Christ). For this purpose, we conducted controlled pollinations to obtain native, exotic and intraspecific hybrid progenies for testing seed viability and seedling performance under experimental common-garden conditions mimicking the severe summer drought in the native population's environment. Proportion of aborted seeds was markedly higher in exotic (>60%) than in intraspecific hybrid (similar to 24%) and native (18%) progenies. Seed germination time and rate were similar across genetic crosses. Hybrid and exotic seedlings died on average 1.2 and 0.8 days earlier than local progenies when exposed to the drought treatment. Cumulative mortality rate was positively associated to biomass allocation in needles, suggesting that higher investment in needles is maladaptive in dry environments for P. sylvestris, probably because of increased total transpiration. Native progenies harbored higher genetic variation than exotic progenies, but similar to hybrids for most phenotypic traits, suggesting low impact of exotic gene flow on the levels of heritable genetic variation of the relict population. To the extent that our results held in natural conditions, they suggest that natural selection in the relict's dry natural environment could potentially hamper the effective establishment of exotic genes via seed and pollen dispersal from the plantations, and that exotic hybridization would not significantly affect the potential of early recruits in response to selection.

"Reproductive phenology of epiphytes in Monteverde, Costa Rica",arboreal plants; biodiversity; cloud forest; Neotropical; phenological patterns; reproductive biology; tropical canopy,HUMID MONTANE FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; NEOTROPICAL FORESTS; AECHMEA-PECTINATA; TROPICAL FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PATTERNS; TREES; CANOPY,"Phenology of plants, or the timing of life cycle events, is important for understanding plant ecology, forest dynamics, and plant-animal interactions. In tropical forests, studies that document epiphyte reproductive phenology are relatively few because of the challenges of tracking plants that live in the canopy. Phenological patterns for 279 individuals of 7 epiphyte species were examined across 12 months in a tropical montane forest in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Epiphytes were located in one of two common tree species, Ficus tuerckheimii (Moraceae) or Ocotea tonduzii (Lauraceae). Flowering and fruiting (i.e., when ripe or unripe fruit is present on the plant) of study plants was recorded on monthly intervals, and phenology was examined as a function of the season at the study site (i.e., wet, transition, or dry season), and pollinator syndrome (bird-, or insect-pollinated) and seed dispersal syndrome (bird-, bat-, or wind-dispersed) of each plant. Though some epiphyte species flowered and fruited throughout the year, the majority showed significant seasonality in phenological events. Based on circular statistics, the timing of mean flowering of different epiphyte species varied, however, timing of mean fruiting for most species tended to occur during the wet season. Insect- and bird-pollinated species had peak flowering during the dry season and late wet season, respectively. Bird-dispersed fruits were present each month of the year with peaks from February to October and again in December. Wind-dispersed fruits were observed eight months of the year with a peak in the early wet season. The timing of epiphyte flowering coincided with flowering of large trees in the area. Epiphyte fruiting, however, is distinct from large tree fruiting. Our results demonstrate the seasonal nature of flowering and fruiting in individual epiphyte species while also highlighted the asynchronous nature of phenological events amongst the epiphyte community.",2015
Sexual specialization in phenology in dioecious Ficus benguetensis and its consequences for the mutualism,Dioecy; Evolutionary conflict; Ficus benguetensis; Phenology; Taiwan,FIG-POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; COMMON FIG; CARICA L; EVOLUTION; MORACEAE; STABILITY; WASP,"Background: Timing of reproductive events has become central in ecological studies linking success in pollination and seed dispersion to optimizing the probability and periods of encounters with pollinators or dispersers. Obligate plant-insect interactions, especially Ficus-fig wasp mutualisms, offer striking examples of fine-tuned encounter optimization as biological cycles between mutualistic partners are deeply dependent on each other and intertwined over generations. Despite fig flowering phenology being crucial in maintaining Ficus-fig wasp mutualisms, until now, the forces of selection shaping the phenological evolution of dioecious fig trees have received little attention. By conducting a 2-year survey of a population of Ficus benguetensis in Northern Taiwan, we assessed whether environmental factors or other selective pressures shape the phenology of male and female fig trees. Results: Constraints by mutualistic pollinating wasps and seed dispersers, rather than climatic factors, appeared to mainly shape fig phenology and allometry in F. benguetensis. We identified a new sexual specialization in dioecious fig trees: the position of fig production. We propose that the continuous male fig production on tree trunks can enhance the survival of pollinating fig wasps through faster localization of receptive figs while reducing the mutualistic conflict between the fig and its obligate pollinators. By contrast, in female trees, fig production is massive in summer, located on the twigs of the foliar crown and seem more related to seed dispersal and germination. Conclusions: Identifying variations in the allometry and phenology of dioecious figs provide valuable insights into how monoecious and dioecious species resolve mutualism conflicts and into the emergence of dioecy in fig trees.",2015

Previous studies on past processes affecting the current distribution of Dactylorhiza species as well as the history of the polyploid complex formation were based only on molecular data. In the present study the ecological niche modeling (ENM) technique was applied in order to describe the distribution of potential refugia for the selected Dactylorhiza representatives during the Last Glacial Maximum. Additionally, future changes in their potential habitat coverage were measured with regard to three various climatic change scenarios. The maximum entropy method was used to create models of suitable niche distribution. A database of Dactylorhiza localities was prepared on the grounds of information collected from literature and data gathered during field works. Our research indicated that the habitats of majority of the studied taxa will decrease by 2080, except for D. incarnata var. incarnata, for which suitable habitats will increase almost two-fold in the global scale. Moreover, the potential habitats of some taxa are located outside their currently known geographical ranges, e.g. the Aleutian Islands, the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, Newfoundland, southern Greenland and Iceland. ENM analysis did not confirm that the Balkans, central Europe or central Russia served as the most important refugia for individual representatives of the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex. Our study rather indicated that the Black Sea coast, southern Apennines and Corsica were the main areas characterized by habitats suitable for most of the taxa.",2015
The network organization of protein interactions in the spliceosome is reproduced by the simple rules of food-web models,,ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; METABOLIC NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; RNA; MODULARITY; YEAST; STEP; SPECIALIZATION,"The network structure of biological systems provides information on the underlying processes shaping their organization and dynamics. Here we examined the structure of the network depicting protein interactions within the spliceosome, the macromolecular complex responsible for splicing in eukaryotic cells. We show the interactions of less connected spliceosome proteins are nested subsets of the connections of the highly connected proteins. At the same time, the network has a modular structure with groups of proteins sharing similar interaction patterns. We then investigated the role of affinity and specificity in shaping the spliceosome network by adapting a probabilistic model originally designed to reproduce food webs. This food-web model was as successful in reproducing the structure of protein interactions as it is in reproducing interactions among species. The good performance of the model suggests affinity and specificity, partially determined by protein size and the timing of association to the complex, may be determining network structure. Moreover, because network models allow building ensembles of realistic networks while encompassing uncertainty they can be useful to examine the dynamics and vulnerability of intracelullar processes. Unraveling the mechanisms organizing the spliceosome interactions is important to characterize the role of individual proteins on splicing catalysis and regulation.",2015
Negative effects of heterospecific pollen receipt vary with abiotic conditions: ecological and evolutionary implications,Co-flowering species; Cuphea gaumeri; heterospecific pollen; pollen tube growth; pollination ecology; pollinator sharing; post-pollination interactions; reproductive success; Yucatan Peninsula; Tamonea curassavica; Angelonia angustifolia; Cuphea gaumeri,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; IN-VITRO; SEED SET; DELPHINIUM-NELSONII; HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION; FLOWERING COMMUNITIES; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOREIGN POLLEN; TUBE GROWTH,"Background and Aims Studies that have evaluated the effects of heterospecific pollen (HP) receipt on plant reproductive success have generally overlooked the variability of the natural abiotic environment in which plants grow. Variability in abiotic conditions, such as light and water availability, has the potential to affect pollen-stigma interactions (i.e. conspecific pollen germination and performance), which will probably influence the effects of HP receipt. Thus, a more complete understanding of the extent, strength and consequences of plant-plant interactions via HP transfer requires better consideration of the range of abiotic conditions in which these interactions occur. This study addresses this issue by evaluating the effects of two HP donors (Tamonea curassavica and Angelonia angustifolia) on the reproductive success of Cuphea gaumeri, an endemic species of the Yucatan Peninsula. Methods Mixed (conspecific pollen and HP) and pure (conspecific pollen only) hand-pollinations were conducted under varying conditions of water and light availability in a full factorial design. Reproductive success was measured as the number of pollen tubes that reached the bottom of the style. Key Results Only one of the two HP donors had a significant effect on C. gaumeri reproductive success, but this effect was dependent on water and light availability. Specifically, HP receipt caused a decrease in pollen tube growth, but only when the availability of water, light or both was low, and not when the availability of both resources was high. Conclusions The results show that the outcome of interspecific post-pollination interactions via HP transfer can be context-dependent and vary with abiotic conditions, thus suggesting that abiotic effects in natural populations may be under-estimated. Such context-dependency could lead to spatial and temporal mosaics in the ecological and evolutionary consequences of post-pollination interactions.",2015
Testing projected wild bee distributions in agricultural habitats: predictive power depends on species traits and habitat type,Arable fields; MAXENT; model validation; orchards; traits; wild bees,LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ECOLOGICAL TRAITS; BUMBLE BEES; POLLINATORS; CONSERVATION; ABUNDANCE; PLANTS; ACCURACY; DECLINES,"Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used to understand the factors that regulate variation in biodiversity patterns and to help plan conservation strategies. However, these models are rarely validated with independently collected data and it is unclear whether SDM performance is maintained across distinct habitats and for species with different functional traits. Highly mobile species, such as bees, can be particularly challenging to model. Here, we use independent sets of occurrence data collected systematically in several agricultural habitats to test how the predictive performance of SDMs for wild bee species depends on species traits, habitat type, and sampling technique. We used a species distribution modeling approach parametrized for the Netherlands, with presence records from 1990 to 2010 for 193 Dutch wild bees. For each species, we built a Maxent model based on 13 climate and landscape variables. We tested the predictive performance of the SDMs with independent datasets collected from orchards and arable fields across the Netherlands from 2010 to 2013, using transect surveys or pan traps. Model predictive performance depended on species traits and habitat type. Occurrence of bee species specialized in habitat and diet was better predicted than generalist bees. Predictions of habitat suitability were also more precise for habitats that are temporally more stable (orchards) than for habitats that suffer regular alterations (arable), particularly for small, solitary bees. As a conservation tool, SDMs are best suited to modeling rarer, specialist species than more generalist and will work best in long-term stable habitats. The variability of complex, short-term habitats is difficult to capture in such models and historical land use generally has low thematic resolution. To improve SDMs' usefulness, models require explanatory variables and collection data that include detailed landscape characteristics, for example, variability of crops and flower availability. Additionally, testing SDMs with field surveys should involve multiple collection techniques.",2015
Lessons from Red Data Books: Plant Vulnerability Increases with Floral Complexity,,POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; CONSERVATION; TRAITS; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; COMMUNITY; ECOLOGY; FLOWER,"The architectural complexity of flower structures (hereafter referred to as floral complexity) may be linked to pollination by specialized pollinators that can increase the probability of successful seed set. As plant-pollinator systems become fragile, a loss of such specialized pollinators could presumably result in an increased likelihood of pollination failure. This is an issue likely to be particularly evident in plants that are currently rare. Using a novel index describing floral complexity we explored whether this aspect of the structure of flowers could be used to predict vulnerability of plant species to extinction. To do this we defined plant vulnerability using the Red Data Book of Rare and Threatened Plants of Greece, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. We also tested whether other intrinsic (e.g. life form, asexual reproduction) or extrinsic (e.g. habitat, altitude, range-restrictedness) factors could affect plant vulnerability. We found that plants with high floral complexity scores were significantly more likely to be vulnerable to extinction. Among all the floral complexity components only floral symmetry was found to have a significant effect, with radial-flower plants appearing to be less vulnerable. Life form was also a predictor of vulnerability, with woody perennial plants having significantly lower risk of extinction. Among the extrinsic factors, both habitat and maximum range were significantly associated with plant vulnerability (coastal plants and narrow-ranged plants are more likely to face higher risk). Although extrinsic and in particular anthropogenic factors determine plant extinction risk, intrinsic traits can indicate a plant's proneness to vulnerability. This raises the potential threat of declining global pollinator diversity interacting with floral complexity to increase the vulnerability of individual plant species. There is potential scope for using plant-pollinator specializations to identify plant species particularly at risk and so target conservation efforts towards them.",2015

This is the case of yew populations growing in Mediterranean mountains under dry climate and a severe anthropogenic disturbance regime, which show insufficient regeneration. We examined two of the likely mechanisms driving this population decline. The study was conducted in a central Spanish yew population in 2005 and 2006. On one hand, we tested for the effect of the amount of pollen received by female flowers by means of a pollen addition experiment. On the other hand, we tested for the effect of initial fruit set on abortion and mature fruit production. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the spatial arrangement of male and female yew trees on realized fecundity. The success of fertilization and fruiting in the experimental population was pollen-limited. Female trees aborted ca. 70% of the fruit set in both years and treatments. Fruit set was significantly influenced by the females' neighbourhood, with fecundity decreasing exponentially with distance to the nearest male in both years. Overall, our results indicate that factors associated with ecological marginality have a strong influence on yew performance.",2015

Historically there are two basic ways to construct an IN: binary networks (BN) that represent unweighted links among species in the web, and weighted networks (WN) that weight each interaction among species by its relative or absolute frequency in the web. We call binary reduction the transition from WN to BN which obviously entails loss of information. We performed an analysis with 69 WN on which we worked the binary reduction. For both WN and BN we computed: the coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, Shannon entropy and the Gini coefficient on the population statistics. We also computed the dependence asymmetry, the pairwise Jaccard distance and two different measures of nestedness, (W)NODF and tau-temperature, for the WN and BN. From correlations between the values for WN and BN we concluded that, for most of the indices, the loss of information due to the binary reduction is not significant. Using a statistical evaluation, for most indices, BN give similar results to their corresponding WN.    ",2015
Increased divergence in floral morphology strongly reduces gene flow in sympatric sexually deceptive orchids with the same pollinator,Ecological character displacement; Ophrys chestermanii; Ophrys normanii; Phenology; Pollinia placement; Mechanical barriers; Reinforcement; Reproductive isolation,REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; OPHRYS ORCHIDACEAE; ODOR SIGNALS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; SCENT; DIVERSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; CONSEQUENCES,"In sexually deceptive orchids, pollinator specificity is the main factor responsible for species isolation. The two sexually deceptive orchids Ophrys chestermanii and Ophrys normanii occur sympatrically on Sardinia and attract the same pollinator, males of Bombus vestalis, by producing the same odour bouquets. Since gene flow between these two species has been shown to be almost absent, their genetic distinctness seems to be preserved by other forms of reproductive barrier than pollinator specificity. The aim of this study is to investigate the nature and strength of these isolation barriers which apparently halt gene flow between these two orchids that share the same pollinator. Morphological measurements, combined with observations of cross-pseudocopulations, revealed that, in sympatry, the longer caudicles of O. normanii and the smaller and differently shaped stigmatic cavity in O. chestermanii are the main factors preventing gene flow between these two sympatric species. In contrast, other pre- or post-mating barriers seem to be weak or absent, as the two species have overlapping flowering time and we were able to rear hybrid offspring from interspecific manual crosses. At the same time, genetic analysis of orchid plantlets collected at sympatric sites detected the presence of only two putative hybrid individuals. Thus, the probability of natural cross-pollination between O. normanii and O. chestermanii seems to be strongly limited by divergence in their floral morphology. For some traits, this divergence was found increased between sympatric populations.",2015

Bluff & Fingerh. (Common Twayblade; Listera ovata (L.) R. Br.) that are relevant to an understanding of its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivores, history and conservation.Neottia ovata is one of the commonest orchids in the British Isles. It occupies a wide range of habitats from lowlands to mountains and from wet to dry sites: deciduous broadleaved and mixed woodland, forest edges, calcareous grassland and scrub, hedgerows, dry meadows, pastures, sand dunes, fens, floodplains and some anthropogenic sites.Neottia ovata is a perennial herb whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a horizontal rhizome that produces a new internode every year. The numerous adventitious roots are mainly colonized by Basidiomycota from Sebacinales (Clade B) but also by several other fungal groups. Dormancy, that is the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons, has been occasionally observed and typically lasts for one, or sometimes 2years. The species flowers from early May to the beginning of July, or August at higher altitudes. The flowers of the genus Neottia possess a sensitive rostellum that releases a viscid fluid when it is touched, gluing the pollinia to the pollinator. N.ovata is pollinated mainly by three insect groups: ichneumonids, sawflies and beetles. The mean fraction of flowers setting fruit is c.40%, but it depends on weather conditions: in rainy weather, it decreases to 10%, and in warm, dry weather, it can increase to 100%. Spontaneous autogamy is rare (1% of flowers).Neottia ovata is classified as a species of Least Concern in Great Britain. Although it appears well adapted to countryside changes, thanks to its wide habitat range, the species has vanished from almost 30% of its historical sites in Britain and Ireland. Agricultural activities are mainly responsible for losses of N.ovata sites in the lowlands.",2015

With the aim to study the relationships between orchid bees and their nectar and aromatic host species, we made systematic samplings of males across two conservation areas in the biogeographic Choco Region of Colombia. We used chemical baits to collect 352 male bees during five months. The pollen attached to their bodies was extracted for palynological identification and to estimate interaction networks. The euglossine community consisted of at least 22 species including Eg. maculilabris, Eg. orellana, Eg. championi and Eg. ignita. The male bees were associated with 84 plants but depended on a small group of them (Peperomia spp. and Anthurium spp, as well as species of Solanaceae, Ericaceae and Malpighiaceae) which were widely distributed across the altitudinal gradient, and were available through the year. The resulting interaction networks revealed a typical nested pattern usually found in plant-pollinator interactions, with several rare bee and plant species interaction with a small group of generalist bees and plant species. Albeit, we found variation within networks related to species composition. Such variation may be a consequence of specific differences in plant flowering phenology.",2015

White-winged doves are intimately linked to anthropogenic changes on the landscape and because of this, have experienced dramatic population fluctuations over the last 75 years in response, both positively and negatively, to anthropogenic changes on the landscape. To understand the factors driving population growth and decline of migratory species like the white-winged dove, it is imperative we study resource use on both their breeding and wintering grounds. To understand how populations are distributed on the wintering grounds, we tested an alternative to band recovery approaches by using stable isotope analysis. Before we could use isotope analysis to link breeding and wintering locations for this species, we first needed to determine if hydrogen (H-2) and carbon (C-13) stable isotopes in feather tissue (H-2(f) and C-13(f), respectively) could differentiate among populations of white-winged doves across their breeding range in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. H-2(f) and C-13(f) not only differentiated between populations of white-winged doves that breed in the United States, but H-2(f) also provided further differentiation in white-winged doves that breed in native Sonoran Desert and agricultural habitats in the western portion of their range. Ecological processes associated with desert resources and anthropogenic influences, specifically saguaro cacti and irrigated crops, largely determined H-2(f) in some white-winged doves in Arizona whereas H-2 of precipitation (H-2(p)) largely determined H-2(f) of doves in New Mexico and Texas. This study highlights the usefulness of stable isotope analysis to differentiate populations of animals across the landscape and the insight isotopes can provide into habitat and resource use.

Chalkbrood: epidemiological perspectives from the host-parasite relationship,,HONEY-BEE COLONIES; APIS-MELLIFERA; ASCOSPHAERA-APIS; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; INSECT SOCIETIES; DISEASE; EVOLUTION; RESISTANCE; VIRULENCE,"Chalkbrood is a fungal brood disease of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, caused by the parasite Ascosphaera apis. Considered as a stress-related disease, the severity of chalkbrood outbreaks depend on a multitude of interacting factors. The specific relationship between host and parasite in this disease is interesting because the parasite is both heterothallic and semelparous. Recent studies highlight that this specific host-parasite relationship is influenced by factors such as interactions with other parasite strains or species, and environmental perturbations. To understand how to protect pollinators most effectively, it is crucial that future research takes a more ecologically relevant approach by studying the basic biology of the host-parasite relationship in the context of the multi-factorial processes that influence it.",2015

Since predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina and Technomyrmex albipes) or mostly trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) were previously shown to differentially use volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from figs as proximal cues for predation on fig wasps, we examined the response of these ants to the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of the wasps. CHC signatures of gallers were distinguished from those of parasitoids by the methyl-branched alkanes 5-methylpentacosane and 13-methylnonacosane which characterised trophic group membership. CHC profiles of wasp predator and wasp prey were congruent suggesting that parasitoids acquire CHCs from their prey; the CHC composition of the parasitoid Apocrypta sp 2 clustered with that of its galler host Apocryptophagus fusca, while the CHC profile of the parasitoid Apocryptophagus agraensis clustered with its galler prey, the fig pollinator Ceratosolen fusciceps. In behavioural assays with ants, parasitoid CHC extracts evoked greater response in all ant species compared to galler extracts, suggesting that parasitoid CHC extracts contain more elicitors of ant behaviour than those of plant feeders. CHCs of some wasp species did not elicit significant responses even in predatory ants, suggesting chemical camouflage. Contrary to earlier studies which demonstrated that predatory ants learned to associate wasp prey with specific fig VOCs, prior exposure to fig wasp CHCs did not affect the reaction of any ant species to these CHCs.

Little is known about the signals that trigger this probably unique phenomenon in agave species. Here we report that auxin plays a central role in bulbil development and show that the localization of PIN1-related proteins is consistent with altered auxin transport during this process. Analysis of agave transcriptome data led to the identification of the A. tequilana orthologue of PIN1 (denoted AtqPIN1) and a second closely related gene from a distinct clade reported as 'Sister of PIN1' (denoted AtqSoPIN1). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed different patterns of expression for each gene during bulbil formation, and heterologous expression of the A. tequilana PIN1 and SoPIN1 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana confirmed functional differences between these genes. Although no free auxin was detected in induced pedicel samples, changes in the levels of auxin precursors were observed. Taken as a whole, the data support the model that AtqPIN1 and AtqSoPIN1 have co-ordinated but distinct functions in relation to auxin transport during the initial stages of bulbil formation.",2015

For example, comparison of interaction networks among study sites can provide clues to geographic variation of host breadth. Obligate plant-ant interactions are ideal systems to explore these phenomena because they are long term and can be accurately sampled in the field. We tested two hypotheses: (1) network structure and host specialization do not vary among communities, and (2) the effects of plant extinction do not vary among communities. We sampled 10 or more plants for each of the 30 ant-plant species found in three Neotropical locations. We found that network specialization, H2', was significantly higher than expected in random networks. The ant or plant specialization index, d', distribution did not vary among localities, neither varied in link or asymmetry distribution. Plant extinction simulations showed that these interactions are vulnerable to plant loss, and the null model was more robust than the observed networks. This study provides a foundation on which plant and ant phylogenies can be added to explore compartment evolution.",2015
The Relative Importance of Flower Color and Shape for the Foraging Monarch Butterfly (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae),Monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus L.; learning; multicomponent signal,MANDUCA-SEXTA; LEAF-SHAPE; PIPEVINE SWALLOWTAIL; VISION; BEHAVIOR; BEES; EVOLUTION; HAWKMOTH; DISCRIMINATION; PAPILIO,"Flowers attract and guide pollinators via a wide array of sensory stimuli, including colors, odors, textures, and even sounds. Bees are known to respond to and learn multimodal and multicomponent floral cues, whereas, historically, studies of learning in butterflies have focused on a single visual stimulus component, most often color. In this study, we examine whether Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) can learn to associate a compound visual stimulus, i.e., color and shape together, with a nectar reward. We also examine the relative importance of color and shape as cues for foraging butterflies. Our results indicate that within the visual modality, foraging Monarchs learn color more readily than shape. Monarchs, however, are capable of learning to associate shape with a sugar reward independent of color, and they may also be capable of learning the compound stimulus of color and shape in the context of foraging. We suggest that the hierarchical importance of cues is likely to vary depending on ecological context, and that although color may be most relevant for a nectar-foraging butterfly, shape may be a more useful cue for a butterfly searching for an oviposition substrate.",2015

We measured transgene flow from transgenic lines to their non-transgenic parental cultivars. A colorimetric method based on quantification of hydrogen peroxide released from oxalic acid in the presence of the oxalate oxidase was used to screen seed embryos from non-transgenic rows at various distances from the transgenic source. The overall transgene flow rate in three cultivars was 0.2094% based on screening over 85,000 seeds. In general, the transgene flow rate greatly declined past 10 m from the transgene source. However, a transgene flow rate of less than 0.05% did occur sporadically at greater distances than 10 m. In conclusion, transgene flow in peanut can be spatially confined to provide negligible rates using relatively short separation distances. The extremely low rate of transgene flow at greater distance was dependent on ecological and environmental contexts, particularly on foraging patterns and flight distance of pollinators.    ",2015

Decline can now be compared both between species and in different parts of species' ranges. We extracted data from distribution atlases to compare range persistence of 736 plant species common to both the UK and Estonia between survey periods encompassing almost the same years (1969 and 1999 in the UK and 1970 and 2004 in Estonia). We determined which traits were most closely associated with variation in species persistence, whether these were the same in each country, and the extent to which they explained differences in persistence between the countries. Mean range size declined less in Estonia than in the UK (24.3% vs. 30.3%). One-third of species in Estonia (239) maintained >90% of their distribution range compared with one-fifth (141) in the UK. In Estonia, 99 species lost >50% of their range compared with 127 species in the UK. Persistence was very positively related to original range in both countries. Major differences in species persistence between the studied countries were primarily determined by biogeographic (affiliation to floristic element) and ecoevolutionary (plant strategy) factors. In contrast, within-country persistence was most strongly determined by tolerance of anthropogenic activities. Decline of species in the families Orchidaceae and Potamogetonaceae was significantly greater in the UK than in Estonia. Almost all of the 736 common and native European plant species in our study are currently declining in their range due to pressure from anthropogenic activities. Those species with low tolerance of human activity, with biotic pollination vectors and in the families referred to above are the most vulnerable, especially where human population density is high.",2015
Costs and benefits of reproducing under unfavorable conditions: an integrated view of ecological and physiological constraints in a cerrado shrub,Cerrado; Ovule fate; Phenology; Pollen limitation; Pre-dispersal seed predation; Resource limitation,BAUHINIA-UNGULATA; SEED PRODUCTION; NEOTROPICAL SAVANNA; BRAZILIAN CERRADO; POLLINATED TREE; BREEDING SYSTEM; FLORAL BIOLOGY; DRY SEASON; HERBIVORY; PATTERNS,"Disentangling the relative importance of biotic and abiotic constraints in plant reproduction is a major challenge in reproductive ecology. Here, we tested the 'resource limitation hypothesis' that predicts a high-level ovule abortion under resource scarcity; the 'flowering displacement hypothesis' that predicts low levels of pollen limitation driven by relaxed competition for pollinators; and the 'herbivory escape hypothesis' that predicts low impact by natural enemies during unfavorable conditions. We followed reproductive phenology, measured the seasonal variation in resource abundance, and calculated initial ovule budgets to estimate the relative importance of each limiting factor on final reproductive output. Ovule fate was determined of ovules in different positions within the pods, and a germination experiment was conducted to identify bottlenecks at the germination stage. Despite marked decreases in resource availability during the dry season, reproduction consistently occurred during mid-to-late dry season. Destruction by natural enemies and abortion were the most likely ovule fates, with only 2.2 % of flower buds converted into ripe fruits. Ovule fates were not random along fruit positions, with higher likelihood of well-formed seeds in fruit tips and higher likelihood of ovule abortion and non-fertilized ovules near the fruit bases. The benefits derived from flowering displacement to the dry season include reduced competition for pollinators and synchronization of seedling establishment with the onset of the rainy season. However, we found no support for the herbivory escape hypothesis. We argue that a cost-benefit approach is a useful framework to understand the evolutionary ecology of phenological strategies in seasonal environments.",2015
Flower colours in temperate forest and grassland habitats: a comparative study,Vision; Communication; Pollination; Illumination; Background,BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; INSECT POLLINATORS; PEAK SHIFT; HONEYBEES; DISCRIMINATION; EVOLUTION; CONSTANCY; ECOLOGY; VISION,"Flower colours are important cues shaping the interaction between plants and pollinators. Plants flowering in distinct habitats like grasslands and forests present their flowers in very different light environments and against different backgrounds. Since most Angiosperms depend on or profit from pollination by animals, plants may exhibit flower colours that are most conspicuous when seen in the predominant illumination or against the predominant background colour of their environment. To compare flower colours of different habitats, we collected flower reflectance spectra of 239 herbs from forest and grassland sites in three German regions. We compared chromatic and achromatic components of flower colours from the honeybee's point of view as well as in principal component analysis (PCA) to exclude the bias of particular visual systems. Our results show that flower colours do not differ between closed forest and open grassland habitats in any chromatic or achromatic aspect both from the bee's perspective and without any model bias (PCA). Thus, although the colours of lights and backgrounds are different between both types of habitats, we find no evidence of an adaptation of flower colours to the visual system of bees. The finding that flower colours look similar for bees in different environments may be related to a mechanism called colour constancy which allows bees and other pollinator species to compensate for varying illumination conditions.",2015

We have reported the flowering phenology, breeding system and pollinator activity of the species distributed in Tianmu Mountain (Zhejiang Province) nature reserves. Flowering occurred during the months of early April to late May, with the peak in the middle of the April, and was synchronous across all four subpopulations. The anthesis of an intact inflorescence lasted from sixteen to twenty-three days with eight to eleven days blossom of an individual flower. In D. pleiantha, the morphological development of flowers and fruit leading to the development of mature seeds takes place over a period 3-5 months from flowering. The average of pollen-ovule ratio (P/O) was 18 898.7. The pollen transfer in this species was mainly performed by flies, Hydrotaea chalcogaster (Muscidae). Controlled pollination experiments indicated D. pleiantha was obligate xenogamyous and self-incompatible, and pollination was pollinator-dependent. Controlled pollination experiments showed that the mean fruit set (%) under the natural condition (17.1%) was markedly lower than that of manual cross-pollination (75.6%). It was concluded that pollen-limitation and mate limitation were responsible for the low fruit set of D. pleiantha in the field. Thus, the identification and translocation of compatible mating types to create reproductively viable populations were essential for the recovery of the rare species.",2015
Extrapolating from local ecological processes to genus-wide patterns in colour polymorphism in South African Protea,cape floristic region; natural selection; elevational gradients; seed predation,FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; ANNUAL LINANTHUS-PARRYAE; FLOWER-COLOR; IPOMOEA-PURPUREA; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; FLORAL PIGMENTATION; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEED PREDATORS; CICHLID FISH,"Polymorphic traits are central to many fundamental discoveries in evolution, yet why they are found in some species and not others remains poorly understood. We use the African genus Protea-within which more than 40% of species have co-occurring pink and white floral colour morphs-to ask whether convergent evolution and ecological similarity could explain the genus-wide pattern of polymorphism. First, we identified environmental correlates of pink morph frequency across 28 populations of four species. Second, we determined whether the same correlates could predict species-level polymorphism and monomorphism across 31 species. We found that pink morph frequency increased with elevation in Protea repens and three section Exsertae species, increased eastward in P. repens, and increased with seed predation intensity in section Exsertae. For cross-species comparisons, populations of monomorphic pink species occurred at higher elevations than populations of monomorphic white species, and 18 polymorphic species spanned broader elevational gradients than 13 monomorphic species. These results suggest that divergent selection along elevational clines has repeatedly favoured polymorphism, and that more uniform selection in altitudinally restricted species may promote colour monomorphism. Our findings are, to our knowledge, the first to link selection acting within species to the presence and absence of colour polymorphism at broader phylogenetic scales.",2015

(Rubiaceae), a shrub in oceanic islands of Taiwan and the Philippines, appears to be distylous, but distyly is usually rare on oceanic islands. To elucidate the functional breeding system of P. cephalophora can improve our understanding of plant reproductive ecology on oceanic islands. Results: Field investigations on Lanyu (Orchid Island) off the coast of southeastern Taiwan revealed the flowers to be distylous with short (S)-and long (L)-styled morphs, with only one morph per individual. Laboratory observations revealed that both morphs had stainable pollen grains and indicated dimorphism in stigmatic papillae and pollen size. In hand pollination experiments, the pollen tubes reached the base of the style in intermorph crossing, whereas they rarely penetrated stylar tissue in intramorph crossing and selfing. Open pollinated S- and L-styled flowers produced fruit. Conclusions: The results indicate that the breeding system of P. cephalophora is morphologically and functionally distylous.",2015

We used weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, to determine the strength of ant repellence in 32 bee-pollinated plant species and used the comparative method to test whether nectar production, size of pollinating bees and plant growth form were related to floral repellence. Flowers were more likely to repel ants if they offered nectar as a reward and were pollinated by small bees than if they were nectarless and pollinated by large bees. Furthermore, tree flowers were more likely than shrub or vine flowers to repel ants. Our results validate the pollinator protection hypothesis and the nectar protection hypothesis. Depending on the ecological context, therefore, ant repellents can function as direct or indirect exploitation barriers: they can prevent ants from removing nectar without effecting pollination (direct barriers) and, when flowers are pollinated by large bees, the absence of ant repellents-or even the presence of ant attractants-can result in ants chasing small ineffective pollinators away (indirect barriers).",2015

(Sea-kale; Crambe pontica Stev. ex Rupr) that are relevant to understand its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.Crambe maritima is found predominantly on southern and western coasts of Britain but also in Scotland, Ireland and elsewhere. It occurs primarily on neutral or slightly alkaline soils on shingle and sand beaches above the drift line, out of reach of average high tides. Equinoctial tides or storms can increase soil salinity, requiring it to be salt tolerant.Crambe maritima is a rosette plant with a fleshy taproot, which is the main perennating organ with a capacity for vegetative propagation. Flowering can take 5-8years when grown from seeds. Reproduction is predominantly by seeds. Root and stem cuttings can be used for vegetative propagation. In winter, each branch ends at ground level in a leafless crimson bud, and in spring, it produces a succession of cabbage-like leaves just above ground level, the first being purple and successive leaves becoming greener.Crambe maritima produces weakly protogynous hermaphrodite flowers. Self- and cross-pollination occurs. Pollination is by insects, flies and bees. The plants usually produce 1000-10000 seeds per year. In Britain, Crambe maritima has been reported to have declined in certain areas but increased in other areas and currently does not have rare or scarce status. There has been an expansion in range in Ireland since the 1960s as it has been recorded at new sites, and while the species has disappeared from some sites in France, it has also been identified in several new sites.",2015

To determine the effects of pollen availability, temperature, and pollinators on seed production in the alpine, we combined pollen-manipulation experiments with measurements of variation in temperature, and abundance and diversity of potential pollinators along a 400-m elevation gradient. We did this for seven dominant species of flowering plants in the Coast Range Mountains, British Columbia, Canada. The number of viable seeds set by plants was influenced by pollen limitation (quantity of pollen received), mate limitation (quality of pollen), temperature, abundance of potential pollinators, seed predation, and combinations of these factors. Early flowering species (n = 3) had higher seed set at high elevation and late-flowering species (n = 4) had higher seed set at low elevation. Degree-days >15 degrees C were good predictors of seed set, particularly in bee-pollinated species, but had inconsistent effects among species. Seed production in one species, Arnica latifolia, was negatively affected by seed-predators (Tephritidae) at mid elevation, where there were fewer frost-hours during the flowering season. Anemone occidentalis, a fly-pollinated, self-compatible species had high seed set at all elevations, likely due to abundant potential pollinators. Simultaneously measuring multiple factors affecting reproductive success of flowering plants helped identify which factors were most important, providing focus for future studies. Our work suggests that responses of plant communities to climate change may be mediated by flowering time, pollination syndrome, and susceptibility to seed predators.",2015

Our data on fig/fig wasp reciprocal mutualism (Ficus racemosa), however, show that structural barriers of female flowers or genetic constraints of pollinators previously hypothesized exist, but cannot sufficiently maintain the mutualism stability. The results show that a positive relationship between seed and wasp production could be maintained in warm season, which might be because of density dependence restraint among foundresses and their low oviposition and pollination efficiency, keeping common resource (female flowers) utilization unsaturated. Whilst, a negative correlation between wasp offspring and viable seed production was also observed in cold season, which might be that the increased oviposition and pollination efficiency maximized the common resource utilization. The fitness trade-off between fig and pollinator wasps is greatly affected by environmental or ecological variations. The local stability might result from temporal low exploitation efficiency of pollinators together with interference competition among pollinators. We suggest that host repression through the active regulation of bract closure, which can create interference competition among the foundresses and prevent extra more foundresses sequential entry in fruit cavities, would help the figs avoiding the cost of over-exploitation. This essentially takes the same role as sanctioning of cheating or competitive behaviors.",2015

We argue that their 1981 paper fits seamlessly in the systematic study of infectious disease dynamics that was initiated by the authors in 1978, combining effective use of simple mathematical models, firmly rooted in biology, with observable or empirically measurable ingredients and quantities, and promoting extensive capacity building. This systematic approach, taking ecology and biology rather than applied mathematics as the motivation for advance, proved essential for the maturation of the field, and culminated in their landmark textbook of 1991.

We conducted multi-year field and laboratory studies of the sexual system and reproductive biology of Solanum vespertilio. Flowers are tetramerous, zygomorphic, heterantherous and sometimes enantiostylous. The species is andromonoecious. Anthers are heteromorphic in both sex forms, with one long upcurved and three straight shorter anthers. The style in male flowers is short to vestigial; in hermaphrodites it is strongly up-turned, longer than the anthers. The single large anther bears 45 % of the pollen. Some of these unusual features may illustrate insular release from selection, though, given the antiquity of the Canaries; they likely constitute selection to promote effective sexual reproduction and outcrossing. Experiments with manually deflected styles showed higher fruit set than controls. The nascent expression of enantiostyly offers the opportunity for understanding its evolution. The species is weakly self-compatible, which may offer fertility insurance, or be remnant of the status of colonizers. Field observations suggest that the number of fruit developing in an inflorescence affects the gender of subsequent flowers. Thus, the strength of andromonoecy may both affect the rate of outcrossing (genetic issues), and/or constitute a mechanism for response to the level of fruit set (physiological/ecological issues). Flowers were buzz-pollinated by large-bodied native bees. Most of the unusual features of S. vespertilio presumably promote effective pollen transport and perhaps outcrossing. Effective conservation programs depend not only on protecting habitat, but also on fruit set; the latter is dependent on knowledge of pollination and reproductive biology.",2015
Phenotypic selection on nectar amino acid composition in the Lepidoptera pollinated orchid species Gymnadenia conopsea,,MEDITERRANEAN FLORAL NECTARS; SUGAR COMPOSITION; MEDIATED SELECTION; SPUR LENGTH; DECEPTIVE ORCHID; DISPLAY; EVOLUTIONARY; BUTTERFLIES; POPULATION; DIVERSITY,"Plant-pollinator interactions are potential drivers of evolution in floral traits. Because nectar chemical composition is known to mediate both plant-pollinator interactions and plant reproductive success, it can be expected that chemical composition of nectar is subjected to strong pollinator-mediated selective forces. However, the extent of natural selection on different nectar components has not been studied so far. Using the Lepidoptera pollinated fragrant orchid Gymnadenia conopsea as a model species, we used high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) to characterize the sugar and amino acid composition of floral nectar in three calcareous grassland populations of G. conopsea. We then measured phenotypic selection on nectar composition and on other plant and floral traits through applying both linear regression and structural equation modelling. We demonstrate phenotypic selection on plant height, inflorescence height and on specific nectar amino acids, whereas spur length, total sugar and amino acid concentration were not direct targets of selection. Chemical nectar composition is thus indeed under selective pressure but nectar amino acids are much more important to fitness of G. conopsea, as compared to nectar sugars. Furthermore, as we found no evidence of selection on the total amino acid concentration, it is unlikely that amino acids increase pollinator attraction because they are a pollinator nitrogen source. To further unravel the evolutionary ecology of floral nectar, behavioural experiments with pollinators exposed to different nectar components and studies experimentally identifying the selective agents are recommended.",2015

Many effective stabilizing mechanisms address one issue or the other, and many turn upon additional features. Using an explicitly demographic approach, I show that indirect, demography-mediated interactions between mutualists and exploiters can enable mutualist-exploiter coexistence, which in turn can stabilize the abundances of mutualists, exploiters, and their shared resources. This occurs because of the distinct resource demographic responses that are inherent to interaction with mutualistic and exploitative partners and can occur in long-lasting, exclusive interactions, such as protection mutualisms, as well as in apparently very different, short-lived mutualistic interactions, such as pollination. The key necessary factor-demographic response to interspecific interaction-is common in nature. Some demographic structure is also necessary and is generated through interspecific interaction in long-lasting associations; it is also very common in natural populations. Thus, the explicitly demographic and multispecies approach taken here constitutes a potentially promising single explanation for the apparent stability ofmutualismin a wide range of natural systems.",2015
Association Patterns in Saproxylic Insect Networks in Three Iberian Mediterranean Woodlands and Their Resistance to Microhabitat Loss,,FOOD WEBS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; POLLINATION NETWORKS; SPECIES EXTINCTIONS; BEETLE ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS; STABILITY,"The assessment of the relationship between species diversity, species interactions and environmental characteristics is indispensable for understanding network architecture and ecological distribution in complex networks. Saproxylic insect communities inhabiting tree hollow microhabitats within Mediterranean woodlands are highly dependent on woodland configuration and on microhabitat supply they harbor, so can be studied under the network analysis perspective. We assessed the differences in interacting patterns according to woodland site, and analysed the importance of functional species in modelling network architecture. We then evaluated their implications for saproxylic assemblages' persistence, through simulations of three possible scenarios of loss of tree hollow microhabitat. Tree hollow-saproxylic insect networks per woodland site presented a significant nested pattern. Those woodlands with higher complexity of tree individuals and tree hollow microhabitats also housed higher species/interactions diversity and complexity of saproxylic networks, and exhibited a higher degree of nestedness, suggesting that a higher woodland complexity positively influences saproxylic diversity and interaction complexity, thus determining higher degree of nestedness. Moreover, the number of insects acting as key interconnectors (nodes falling into the core region, using core/periphery tests) was similar among woodland sites, but the species identity varied on each. Such differences in insect core composition among woodland sites suggest the functional role they depict at woodland scale. Tree hollows acting as core corresponded with large tree hollows near the ground and simultaneously housing various breeding microsites, whereas core insects were species mediating relevant ecological interactions within saproxylic communities, e.g. predation, competitive or facilitation interactions. Differences in network patterns and tree hollow characteristics among woodland sites clearly defined different sensitivity to microhabitat loss, and higher saproxylic diversity and woodland complexity showed positive relation with robustness. These results highlight that woodland complexity goes hand in hand with biotic and ecological complexity of saproxylic networks, and together exhibited positive effects on network robustness.",2015

Understanding the reproductive biology of plants, especially rare species, is fundamental to clarifying their evolution, estimating potential for change, and for creating effective conservation plans. Clarification of sexual systems like dioecy, and unusual manifestations of it in specific studies within Solanum, helps elucidate evolutionary patterns and genetic and ecological control of sex expression. Methods: Studies of reproductive systems of two Caribbean endemics, S. polygamum and S. conocarpum, combined multifaceted analyses of field populations and of multiple generations of greenhouse plants. Key results: The dioecy in both species is, like that in other solanums, largely cryptic, although the gender of S. polygamum flowers is obvious. The rare S. conocarpum is recognized as dioecious; floral gender is not obvious. Variation in sex expression facilitated experiments and promoted hypotheses on control and significance of morphological features and sex expression. Conclusions: Confirmed dioecy in at least 15 solanums is distributed across the genus, with perhaps 6 independent origins, and with crypticity in the form of morphologically hermaphroditic, but functionally unisexual, flowers characterizing all species. Dioecy is not more strongly associated with islands. Inaperturate pollen in pistillate flowers characterizes almost all, but not the two dioecious species studied herein. Dioecy in both species indicates leakiness (rare hermaphroditic flowers on male plants) that helps explain island colonization and radiation. Leakiness allowed confirmation-usually impossible for dioecious species-of self-compatibility for S. polygamum, and thus support for the hypothesis that dioecy evolved to promote outcrossing.",2015
Morphometric analysis of floral variation in the Pyrola picta species complex (Ericaceae): interpretation and implications for ecological and phylogenetic differentiation,anthers; buzz pollination; floral display; North America; phenology; Scotophyllae,BUZZ-POLLINATION; NORTH-AMERICA; TRAITS,"The Pyrola picta species complex of western North America comprises four species (P. picta, P. dentata, P. aphylla and P. crypta) that grow sympatrically in some parts of their collective ranges, have remarkably similar flowers and share pollinators. These species do not exhibit the genetic signatures typical of random or heterospecific mating, but instead show genetic divergence patterns indicating that they maintain surprising levels of reproductive isolation. To better understand how species boundaries are maintained, the current study uses statistical ordination analyses to determine whether species isolation across shared geographical ranges might be achieved through subtle differences in floral characters among species. The possible contribution of differences in flowering phenology (e.g. temporal reproductive isolation) to reproductive isolation was also evaluated for the small subset of populations in which two or more species occur in direct sympatry. Among species in the P. picta complex, there are both phylogenetic and geographical trends in some floral characteristics, whereas other characters do not covary with either geography or species identity. In several sympatric populations, differences in flowering phenology among species suggest that timing plays a major role in non-random (i.e. mainly conspecific) mating. The conclusions of this study are that reproductive isolation in the P. picta species complex is reinforced by differences in the timing of floral maturation and the morphologies of androecium and floral display characters.

Mutualistic relationships under landscape change: Carnivorous mammals and plants after 30 years of land abandonment,Plant-animal interactions; Mutualistic networks; Temporal dynamics; Carnivores; Frugivorous mammals; Land abandonment,SEED DISPERSAL; POLLINATION NETWORK; GLOBAL CHANGE; HABITATS; TREE; BIODIVERSITY; FRUGIVORES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; MARTENS,"Little is currently known about the dynamics of mutualistic interactions in relation to land abandonment. Using data from two studies on frugivory and seed dispersal by carnivorous mammals carried out at the same site, and spanning three decades, we show how plant-frugivore interactions change in the long-term after a process of land abandonment in a mountainous area of NW Spain. Over time, the change in the identities of interacting species was small. However, considering the quantitative participation of each species along with the identity and number of strong links, the change was significant. After land abandonment, two successional plant species (rowan and bramble) and a cultivated species (cherry tree) dominated the interactions with carnivores and red foxes replaced pine martens as the main frugivores. The prevalence of cherry tree increased significantly in this sub-web, probably as a consequence of the preference of carnivores for human-selected fruits (higher pulp/seed ratio) and the abandonment of harvesting as a result of the declining human population. Our results suggest that the frequency of interactions between plants and carnivores may be modulated by plant abundance, which in turn is primarily influenced by land abandonment in this scenario, fruit preference by dispersers and the interaction between these two factors. The temporal assessment of plant-animal mutualisms appears to be a valuable tool to predict the course of successional processes. A functional consequence of red foxes as the main frugivore is a higher frequency of long-distance seed dispersal events, which increases connectivity among plant populations, favors colonization and ultimately may shape the course of the successional process. Our study exemplifies the pressing need for more information on the temporal dynamics of ecological interactions in order to understand how they respond to anthropogenic changes such as land abandonment.",2015
Effectiveness of managed populations of wild and honey bees as supplemental pollinators of sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) under different climatic conditions,Osmia rufa; Bombus terrestris; Apis mellifera; Prunus cerasus cv.

Flight activity of the three bee species during the pollination-receptive period of the cultivar 'Stevnsbaer' was recorded. Also, using insect-proof cages constructed around 'Stevnsbaer' trees, fruit set and yield were recorded and compared with self-pollination in the absence of insects and open pollination. When floral development and seasonal conditions are suitable, there is a potential role for introduced Osmia rufa and B. terrestris to add to the pollination activity of conventionally employed A. mellifera. However, in a season with a less favourable weather history, and despite comparable activity of the three species during the pollen-receptive period, introduced bees had only a limited effect on fruit set and yield and could not raise yield above that of freely pollinated branches. The contribution of appropriately dense populations of introduced bees in the orchard, given favourable weather conditions, is clear, but maintenance of populations of introduced, wild bees, compared with honey bees may well be impractical due to cost. Known ecological risks associated with species introduction also need to be considered. Consequently, if wild bee populations are to be used to secure the potential benefits of increased fruit set and yield, then positive habitat management will be necessary to sustain the required populations.",2015
Reproductive ecology of buzz-pollinated Ouratea spectabilis trees (Ochnaceae) in Brazilian Cerrados,,,"Ouratea spectabilis is a ubiquitous tree species in the Brazilian savannas, or Cerrados, where it plays an important ecological role. We studied its anthesis phenology, pollination biology, pollen viability, and pollen tube growth, and executed a set of intra-and interspecific experimental crosses to determine its mechanisms of incompatibility and reproductive ecology. The species presents a specialized buzz pollination syndrome and is served by a small array of specialized pollinator species. It is a mostly self-incompatible species, and although self-pollination is possible, it strongly reduces fertility, with reproductive outputs for hand self-pollination similar to those of interspecific crosses with the co-generic species O. hexasperma. Incompatibility with another commonly co-occurring co-generic species, O. floribunda, was complete, with a null fruit set, as occurred for the autonomous apomixis tests. Our pollen tube growth observations indicate that incompatibility occurs at the style, and is thus pre-zygotic. All three Ouratea species presented very high pollen viability. Manual pollen supplementation did not increase seed sets. Nevertheless, even after excess manual pollen supplementation, seed-to-ovule ratios were only 30 %. Such limits are common in stressful environments, and fruit production for most Cerrado species is reported to be regularly under those levels. The apparent ubiquity of this fertility limit among Cerrado species poses interesting ecological questions, such as the role of environmental stress on reproduction and the potential overproduction of ovules as an evolutionary strategy to deal with seed predation -questions which deserve further research in the future.",2015
Assessing the potential supply of landscape services to support ecological restoration of degraded landscapes: A case study in the Austrian-Hungarian trans-boundary region of Lake Neusiedl,Ecosystem service; Constructed vegetation types; Leitbild,NATURAL VEGETATION CONCEPT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CULTURAL LANDSCAPES; LAND-USE; CLASSIFICATION; ASSESSMENTS; INDICATORS; VALUATION; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS,"The concept of ecosystem functions and services has increasingly gained attention in the scientific and political community in the last decade. Lot of work has been performed to assess the actual delivery of different services for society. Still, the reference of the landscape's potential to supply these actual services has not been investigated satisfactory so far. We thus aimed at assess the potential supply of landscape services in the study area of Lake Neusiedl in Austria - a region of acknowledged diversity and environmental quality - and compared these to the actual ones. We did this by setting up a map of constructed vegetation type where physiographic site conditions were used to calculate potential land cover in the area in GIS. These constructed vegetation types were linked to landscape services within a capacity matrix giving a weight between 0 (no supply) and 5 (high supply) to which amount one type can provide each single service. The resulting map showed large differences in areal extent of the different vegetation types reflecting the different landscapes in the region such as the dominance of forest steppe in the terraced landscapes or the occurrence of halophytic vegetation only in the lake basin. The same is true for the different landscape services. Some services like 'nursery' and 'raw materials' were quite highly provided throughout the area with values between 2.12 and 4.84, whereas 'genetic resources' and 'pollination' were only little provided (all values <2). On the other hand, functions like 'nutrient regulation' or 'refugium' exhibited their large potential with values >4 in the study area. The aggregation of the services by averaging values to finally derive three main service groups gave the highest values always to habitat (values between 3.1 and 4.8), followed by regulation (2.5-4.2) and then provision (1.9-3.2). Comparing the potential with the actual service supply, nearly all landscapes in the study area resulted in higher potential than the actual service supply. We further discuss possibilities to use the potential supply as a leitbild where restoration projects might be settled in the study area even though more detailed local data will be needed to set these projects up.

Meliponini and Apini in Africa (Apidae: Apinae): a review on the challenges and stakes bound to their diversity and their distribution,Biodiversity; honey bees; Melipona; bee colonies; risk factors; biodiversity conservation; Gabon,IMPENETRABLE NATIONAL-PARK; STINGLESS BEES APIDAE; MELLIFERA-SCUTELLATA; NESTING BIOLOGY; HONEY; UGANDA; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; PHYLOGENY,"Introduction. Meliponini and Apini contribute to the pollination of flowering plants and to improving agricultural yields. These bees' diversity, distribution and abundance depend on the ecosystem in which they evolve. The present work aims to summarize the diversity, distribution, abundance, potential threats, challenges and issues faced with respect to these social bees in Africa. Literature. In Africa, there were 21 species of Meliponini and 2 species of Apini (Apis). Aspects related to the species diversity, distribution, biology, ecology and abundance of nests are poorly documented, especially for Meliponini. This deficit could be related to a lack of interest of the authors or the various difficulties in performing these studies in Africa. With regard to the difficulties, there is a need to clarify the taxonomy of Meliponini, and the observation of nests in certain forest environments is difficult. Nest predation and habitat loss are the main threats that could cause the depopulation of certain social bee species in Africa. If there is currently new evidence that diseases and pests did not endanger these bees, then there is a need for further studies for better assessment of the risks that are associated with these potential threats. Conclusions. Work on the diversity, distribution and abundance of the social bees must be strengthened to address the challenges that are related to these insects in Africa. Indeed, this approach will contribute to answering the challenges of sustainable management of the biodiversity and economic and agricultural issues.",2015

INFECTION; EUROPE; IBERIENSIS; EXPRESSION,"Up until a few years ago, the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae was considered to be a pathogen of Apis cerana exclusively; however, only recently it has shown to be very virulent to Apis mellifera. Therefore, it has been named as apathogenic agent active in the disappearance of honey bee colonies globally, infecting all members of the colony. Honey bees are widely used for pollination and honey production, hence their importance in agriculture. They also play an important ecological role in plant pollination: a third of human food crops are pollinated by bees as well as many plants consumed by other animals. In this context, the object of this review is to summarise the information published by different authors on the geographical distribution and the morphological and genetic characteristics of this parasite, the symptomatology of the disease and the control methods used in those countries where N. ceranae is present, in order to identify better tools to confront this new bee disease.",2015
Research on mutualisms between native and non-native partners can contribute critical ecological insights,,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; CO-INVASION; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; NETWORKS; SPECIALIZATION; EVOLUTION; FACILITATION,"Mutualisms are important structuring forces in ecological communities, influencing ecosystem functions, diversity, and evolutionary trajectories. New interactions, particularly between native and non-native species, are globally increasing in biotic communities as species introductions accelerate. Positive interactions such as novel mutualisms can affect the fitness of organisms in invaded communities. Non-natives can augment native mutualism networks, replace extinct native partners, or disrupt native mutualisms. Because they are actively forming or newly formed, novel mutualisms offer a unique opportunity to examine in real time the factors governing early mutualism formation and stability, including frequency-dependent processes and those relying on specific traits or functions. These central ecological questions have been inferred from long-formed mutualisms, but novel mutualisms may allow a glimpse of successes and failures in ecological time with insights into the relative importance of these factors as ecological systems shift. To this end, this commentary addresses how novel mutualisms inform our understanding of mutualism formation, stability, the importance of functional traits, and niche vs. neutral processes, using examples across multiple systems. Novel mutualism research thus far has been largely limited in both questions and ecosystems, but if more broadly applied could benefit both theoretical and applied ecology.",2015
"Knowledge of the reproductive ecology of the invasive Salix cinerea, in its invaded range, assists in more targeted management strategies",germination; pollination; seed longevity; weed; willow,SEED DISPERSAL; INSECT POLLINATION; DIOECIOUS TREE; ARROYO WILLOW; WIND; SALICACEAE; PLANTS; SACHALINENSIS; COMMUNITIES; LASIOLEPIS,"Management for invasive species is expensive, costing millions of dollars every year and is sometimes unsuccessful. Current control efforts for the highly invasive willow species, Salix cinerea, are extensive, costly, and not always effective because of rapid post-removal reinfestation. An improved knowledge of the reproductive ecology of this species will help design control strategies that minimise future expansion and make current control efforts more effective. To explicitly examine the reproductive ecology of this species in its invaded range in south-eastern Australia, field observations of population structure and sex ratios, pollination experiments and germination trials were undertaken across the Ovens catchment in Victoria. Pollination-exclusion experiments strongly suggest that Salix cinerea in Australia employs two pollen-dispersal mechanisms, with insects being the dominant vector and wind playing a small but significant role (ambophilous). Seed had high initial germination rates, above 95%, but seed is very short-lived with rapid linear decline in germinability until 8 weeks, after which there was no germination at all. An improved understanding of the limited seed bank of this species and the potential it has for long distance pollination has highlighted that preventing reinfestation after control efforts should be focussed on limiting seed production and dispersal. A greater understanding of a species reproductive ecology, particularly of weed species, in their new environment can assist land managers to more effectively target their efforts for long-term eradication strategies.",2015

As the annual exotic Impatiens balfourii (Balsaminaceae) is spreading in several temperate countries, we assessed its characteristics linked to sexual reproduction. The reproductive traits and the breeding system which could indicate some trends that might favour population spread and invasion were examined. Hand pollination treatments were performed under controlled conditions to evaluate (1) autonomous selfing ability, (2) self-compatibility and (3) inbreeding depression. Floral biology including morphology as well as nectar and pollen production was also assessed. Impatiens balfourii presented large quantities (6.7 mu l/flower) of sucrose dominant nectar. Sucrose dominant nectars are known as highly attractive for bees, potential pollinators of I. balfourii. Total sugar concentration of the nectar (47%) was high and situated within the range of bee-pollinated plants. Following hand pollination treatments, fruit and seed sets were similar after cross- and self- pollination. The species was thus self-compatible and no inbreeding depression was detected. The flowers were not totally protandrous as the stigmas were already receptive at bud stage. Autonomous selfing ability was high at the seed but low at the fruit level. In conclusion, the species presents traits linked to a high attractiveness for pollinators and a high fecundity that might allow high reproductive output. The invasive potential still needs to be estimated. ",2015

Soo is a polycarpic perennial herb occurring in the Central European, Eastern European, and Balkan floristic provinces. At the European scale, the IUCN considers it a species of ""least concern"". This paper reviews the taxonomic status, morphology, distribution, habitat requirements, mycorrhizal associations, and life cycle of D. sambucina, with special emphasis on its reproduction. We also summarize information on chromosome numbers and genetic variation. Our data from 12 years of monitoring D. sambucina in the Czech Republic show that three to four leaves have to be produced prior to flowering; plants with five and more leaves flower regularly. Juvenile plants near adult plants suggest recruitment from seeds. About 20% of our 450 monitored plants underwent dormancy (failure of mature plants to produce above-ground parts in one or more growing seasons), the maximum duration being eight years. After reappearance, these individuals were usually sterile for the next year. Mortality was highest (24%) at the seedling stage. Regarding the purple/yellow flower colour polymorphism that characterizes D. sambucina, we found no correlation between morph frequency and soil properties (pH, calcium content), population density, or altitude above sea level.

Much less is known about the links between belowground and aboveground mutualisms, which have been studied separately for decades. It has not been until recently that these mutualisms-mycorrhizas and legume-rhizobia on one hand, and pollinators and seed dispersers on the other hand-have been found to influence each other, with potential ecological and evolutionary consequences. Here we review the mechanisms that may link these two-level mutualisms, mostly reported for native plant species, and make predictions about their relevance during alien plant invasions. We propose that alien plants establishing effective mutualisms with belowground microbes might improve their reproductive success through positive interactions between those mutualists and pollinators and seed dispersers. On the other hand, changes in the abundance and diversity of soil mutualists induced by invasion can also interfere with below-aboveground links for native plant species. We conclude that further research on this topic is needed in the field of invasion ecology as it can provide interesting clues on synergistic interactions and invasional meltdowns during alien plant invasions.",2015

Kefersteinia carolorum is similar to K. lactea from Costa Rica, but it differs in the non-resupinate flowers and the longer callus. The labellum in the upper-most position that distinguishes this species is unique in the genus but has evolved independently in Zygopetalinae at least three times. Evolutionary, ecological, and functional implications of this character are explored. The conservation status of the new taxon is assessed as DD according to IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) criteria. We also provide a key to identify the genera of the Zygopetalinae with labellum in an upper-most position. In addition, we offer a key for the Kefersteinia species from Venezuela, a figure, and a map showing their geographical distributions.",2015

These two factors determine whether the plant has the potential to produce honey by honey bees. Here, we characterized flowering phenology, quantified nectar yield and calculated honey potentiality of Talh (Acacia gerrardii Benth.). Talh is a widespread melliferous species distributed in Africa and the Middle East. Field investigations were performed in Rawdhat-Khoraim oasis, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from April to August for 3 years (2011-2013). Flowering phenology, nectar yield and tree canopy area data were used to predict the honey production potential of Talh trees. The bloom season of Talh trees began around mid-May and ended in mid-August. Flower density varied significantly (p<0.001) among months, while the general mean (+/- SE) was 148 +/- 14 flower heads (FHs) per m(2) per day. The total soluble solids (TSS) secreted were 30.4 mg/ FH/ day. Talh trees may produce potential honey weighing 495 +/- 60 g/ tree/ day and 45,032 +/- 6,359 g/ tree/ season. In conclusion, Talh trees have a high potential for honey production. Further studies are needed to estimate the actual honey production and to understand other aspects of flowering.",2015

Scientists studied the uptake and sequestration of the secondarymetabolites aristolochic acids from A. delavayi leaves by different stages of pipevine swallowtail as a defense mechanism; low fruit set of the myophilous A. delavayi due to pollinator limitation; and the emission of chemical signals that attract parasitic wasps by the prepupae of B. daemonius. The results of these studies were part of an education program delivered by personnel of non-governmental organizations. The program was devised to deliver information to the public about the health risks of consuming A. delavayi individuals (aristolochic-acid-associated cancers) and to establish a bridge between the public and scientific research. Following delivery of the program, the behavior of residents changed considerably. Community residents were involved in management activities, including participation in a program to promote understanding of ecological interactions between A. delavayi and B. daemonius; designing an in situ conservation site; monitoring A. delavayi and B. daemonius individuals; and promoting the natural fruit set of A. delavayi by scattering animal excrement to attract fly pollinators. The integration of scientific information and community participation appears to have resulted in an increase in abundance of threatened A. delavayi and B. daemonius populations. We believe the involvement of local people in conservation is necessary for successful species conservation.",2015

The objective of this study was to describe the composition and structure of the wasp community associated with four species of Ficus in the municipal area of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 600 syconia from four species were collected. The study species were: Ficus obtusifolia Kunth; Ficus citrifolia Mill; E americana subspecies guianensis Desv. form mathewsii; and E americana subspecies guianensis Desv. form parkeriana. Statistical analyses were used to examine the relationship between fig wasp diversity and syconium diameter, and the effect of non-pollinating wasps on numbers of pollinators and seeds. Forty three species of fig wasp were identified, distributed across seven genera (Pegoscapus, Idarnes, Aepocerus, Physothorax, Anidarnes, Heterandrium, Eurytoma). Idarnes (carme group) was the wasps genus non-pollinator with greatest number of individuals with the greatest number of infested syconia (7409 wasps in 376 syconia). Analysing non-pollinating wasp diversity in relation to fig diameter, a significant difference was observed between the four fig species. Ficus citrifolia and E americana subspecies guianensis form mathewsii had the smallest diameter but the greatest diversity of fig wasp. Ficus obtusifolia was the only species in which the non-pollinating wasps had a significant negative effect on the number of Pegoscapus sp. and on seed production.",2015

Here, we report two species of sphingids as pollinators of Cereus aethiops, a wide-spread shrubby columnar cactus species from the Argentinian Monte vegetation. Cereus aethiops is remarkable for its desiccation tolerance during the dry winter season and rapid rehydration after the first rainfall during the summer season. Rehydration starts within 24 hours after the start of the first significant rain, and is complete within 7 to 10 days. Flower bud initiation is triggered by the first rainfall event, and the time from the first rain to the start of the flowering season shows little year-to-year variation. The flowers conform to the sphingophilous pollination syndrome, and the expected sphingid pollinators could be confirmed by direct observation. Diurnal plant-insect interactions in C. aethiops are insignificant and most likely do not contribute significantly to reproductive output.",2015
Evaluation of genetic variation among wild rice populations in Cambodia,wild rice population; Oryza rufipogon Gruff.; genetic variation; Cambodia; annual/perennial,ORYZA-SATIVA; GENOME DIFFERENTIATION; CULTIVATED RICE; CHLOROPLAST; RUFIPOGON; LAOS,"A total of 448 samples in five natural populations of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) were collected in Cambodia. They were examined using 12 SSR and two chloroplast markers to evaluate the degree of variation among populations and the genetic structure within populations. In the two annual populations, the number of plants with homozygous alleles at all 12 SSR loci were high (66.3% and 79.5%), suggesting that these plants propagate mainly through self-pollination. In the three perennial populations, no individuals had all homozygous genotypes, but redundant genotypes resulted from clonal propagation were observed. Percentages of the redundant genotypes were highly varied (3.6%, 29.2% and 86.0%). This may be due to the different stable levels of environmental conditions. As for chloroplast genome, most of the wild plants showed the same chloroplast types as most Indica-type cultivars have. However, plants with different chloroplast types were maintained, even in the same population. In tropical Asian countries, many wild rice populations were observed under similar ecological conditions examined in this study. Therefore, the present results concerning population structure will be important to further elucidate genetic features of wild rice, and will also give strong clues to utilize and conserve wild natural genetic resources.",2015

Parental wild bees originated in central Texas (TX), central-northern Utah (UT), and central California (CA). They were then intercrossed and raised inside a mesh enclosure in southern Mississippi (MS). Females from all possible mated pairs of O. ribifloris produced F-1 broods with 30-40% female cocoons and outcrossed progeny were 30% heavier. Mitochondrial (COI) genomes of the four populations revealed three distinct clades, a TX-CA clade, a UT clade, and an MS clade, the latter (MS) representing captive progeny of CA and UT bees. Although classified as separate subspecies, TX and CA populations from 30A degrees N to 38A degrees N latitude shared 98% similarity in COI genomes and the greatest brood biomass per nest straw (600- to 700-mg brood). Thus, TX and CA bees show greater adaptation for southern U.S. sites. In contrast, UT-sourced bees were more distantly related to TX and CA bees and also produced similar to 50% fewer brood. These results, taken together, confirm that adult O. ribifloris from all trap-nest sites are genetically compatible, but some phenotypic variation exists that could affect this species performance as a commercial blueberry pollinator. Males, their sperm, or perhaps a substance in their sperm helped stabilize our captive bee population by promoting legitimate nesting over nest usurpation. Otherwise, without insemination, 50% fewer females nested (they nested 14 d late) and 20% usurped nests, killing 33-67% of brood in affected nests.",2015
The effect of phenological variation in sex expression on female reproductive success in Saxifraga granulata,first flowering date; flowering phenology; gender; protandry; reproductive ecology; seed production; sex allocation; within-plant variation,POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; FLOWERING TIME; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; PERENNIAL HERB; FRUIT-SET; SEED SET; PLANTS; ALLOCATION,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Differences in timing of flowering within and among protandrous plants shift the floral sex ratio from male to female dominance during the flowering season. Hence, the number of seeds produced by a single flower depends on traits of the flower itself (e.g., allocation to male and female function, position within an inflorescence, and flower size), as well as plant traits (e.g., timing of flowering, number of flowers, and plant height). Although it is clear that characteristics of individual flowers and whole plants can affect the number of seeds produced per flower, their relative importance for plant fitness remains largely unknown. METHODS: We examined how phenological sex expression affected seed number per flower in two populations of the protandrous grassland herb Saxifraga granulata. Seed number was assessed for >1200 flowers and related to their position within an inflorescence, male and female phase duration, timing of flowering, number of flowers per plant, and plant height. KEY RESULTS: Seed number within and among plants decreased significantly over time. Early lateral flowers were larger and produced more seeds in comparison to late lateral flowers, indicating that flower position significantly affected seed number through its combined effect on sex allocation, timing of flowering, and attractiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that female reproductive success of a single flower was best explained by its position within an inflorescence and that plant traits such as first flowering date and number of flowers per plant had a smaller impact on seed number per flower.",2015
Using Expectation Maximization and Resource Overlap Techniques to Classify Species According to Their Niche Similarities in Mutualistic Networks,mutualistic networks; expectation maximization algorithm; niche theory,FOOD-WEB; ECOLOGY; PLANTS; POLLINATORS; MODULARITY; MORPHOLOGY; PATTERNS; MODELS; BEES,"Mutualistic networks in nature are widespread and play a key role in generating the diversity of life on Earth. They constitute an interdisciplinary field where physicists, biologists and computer scientists work together. Plant-pollinator mutualisms in particular form complex networks of interdependence between often hundreds of species. Understanding the architecture of these networks is of paramount importance for assessing the robustness of the corresponding communities to global change and management strategies. Advances in this problem are currently limited mainly due to the lack of methodological tools to deal with the intrinsic complexity of mutualisms, as well as the scarcity and incompleteness of available empirical data. One way to uncover the structure underlying complex networks is to employ information theoretical statistical inference methods, such as the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In particular, such an approach can be used to cluster the nodes of a network based on the similarity of their node neighborhoods. Here, we show how to connect network theory with the classical ecological niche theory for mutualistic plant-pollinator webs by using the EM algorithm. We apply EM to classify the nodes of an extensive collection of mutualistic plant-pollinator networks according to their connection similarity. We find that EM recovers largely the same clustering of the species as an alternative recently proposed method based on resource overlap, where one considers each party as a consuming resource for the other party (plants providing food to animals, while animals assist the reproduction of plants). Furthermore, using the EM algorithm, we can obtain a sequence of successfully-refined classifications that enables us to identify the fine-structure of the ecological network and understand better the niche distribution both for plants and animals. This is an example of how information theoretical methods help to systematize and unify work in ecology.",2015
The importance of spatial heterogeneity and self-restraint on mutualism stability - a quantitative review,,FIG-WASP MUTUALISM; POLLINATOR MUTUALISM; VISCOUS POPULATIONS; HOST SANCTIONS; EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; SELECTION; ALTRUISM; ECOLOGY; MODEL,"Understanding the factors that enable mutualisms to evolve and to subsequently remain stable over time, is essential to fully understand patterns of global biodiversity and for evidence based conservation policy. Theoretically, spatial heterogeneity of mutualists, through increased likelihood of fidelity between cooperative partners in structured populations, and 'self-restraint' of symbionts, due to selection against high levels of virulence leading to short-term host overexploitation, will result in either a positive correlation between the reproductive success of both mutualists prior to the total exploitation of any host resource or no correlation after any host resource has been fully exploited. A quantitative review by meta-analysis on the results of 96 studies from 35 papers, showed no evidence of a significant fitness correlation between mutualists across a range of systems that captured much taxonomic diversity. However, when the data were split according to four categories of host: 1) cnidarian corals, 2) woody plants, 3) herbaceous plants, and 4) insects, a significantly positive effect in corals was revealed. The trends for the remaining three categories did not significantly differ to zero. Our results suggest that stability in mutualisms requires alternative processes, or mechanisms in addition to, spatial heterogeneity of hosts and/or 'self-restraint' of symbionts.",2015

We expected higher proportion of well-formed seeds near the fruit tips and of unfertilized and aborted ovules near fruit bases. We collected pods of Poincianella pyramidalis and Anandenanthera colubrina in a seasonal dry forest in northeastern Brazil and recorded total pod length and ovule number, position, and fate (unfertilized, well formed, aborted, and predated). The proportion of well-formed ovules at fruit tips was significantly higher than at fruit bases in P. pyramidalis. The opposite pattern was found for unfertilized and aborted ovules, thus corroborating our hypothesis. However, the probability of seed predation in A. colubrina was significantly higher in pod tips, thus providing moderate support for our hypotheses. Interspecific differences in the patterns of ovule fate are likely to be driven by species pollination systems.",2015

Trees produced functionally unisexual flowers with white petals, organized densely on inflorescences. Staminate flowers produced high percentage of viable pollen and relatively abundant nectar (15.75 mu l) as a reward to the pollinators, while pistillate flowers produced only nectar (12 mu l). Successful fruit set with wind pollination was facilitated by synchronization of flowering male and female trees, long term receptivity of stigma in female flowers and extended lifespan of flowers.

We found that the shore earwig, Labidura riparia (Dermaptera: Labiduridae) when bitten by anole lizards, Anolis carolinenesus, spits a rotting-flesh odor that deceives these insectivores into rejecting prey. Once a lizard attacked and rejected an earwig, the lizard did not attack another earwig during several weeks despite consuming other prey, indicating associative learning after one trial. The fetid odor was found in the head-prothorax containing salivary glands of both male and female earwigs and was comprised of similar to 100 ng dimethyl disulfide and similar to 600 ng dimethyl trisulfide. Nymphs had <5 ng of either compound. Adults also spit odorous sulfides after prolonged attacks by harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus, who were only deterred by the earwig's forceps. Sulfides released by the earwig are similar to odors of carrion/feces, which may be innately repulsive to some vertebrate predators. The mean initial discharge percentage (IDP) of sulfides from a cohort of earwigs was 62 %; however, IDPs of individuals were highly variable (3-99 %; mean 57 %). The discharge refill time (DRT) to refill 50 % of the earwig's allomone reservoir was estimated at 13 h. A positive relationship in sulfide amounts with body weight was found only in females in 2009, suggesting metabolic cost tradeoffs were revealed when sulfide content was half that in 2010. This is the first report of insects releasing sulfur-containing compounds that may mimic carrion-fecal odors as a deceptive defense against vertebrate predators.",2015
LATE-SEASON SURVEY OF BUMBLE BEES ALONG CANADIAN HIGHWAYS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND YUKON TERRITORIES,,BOMBUS-OCCIDENTALIS; SPECIAL FOCUS; NOSEMA-BOMBI; ROAD VERGES; DECLINE; HYMENOPTERA; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY,"Bumble bees are important pollinators of flowering plants, foraging and providing pollination services throughout the growing season. They are adapted to cool temperatures and are among the most important of all pollinators at high elevations and northern latitudes. Over the past several decades, multiple species of bumble bees have experienced declines in both geographic range and abundance in Europe and North America, while 4 species of the genus Bombus (Bombus) have suffered dramatic declines in the United States. Such declines are not as evident in Alaska, and the status of Bombus remains relatively unknown in the adjacent territories of Canada. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we sampled the bumble bee fauna foraging on floral patches along 5 highways of Canada and southeastern Alaska in a short-term, one-time survey during late summer 2010. We observed 14 species and found Bombus assemblages to be structured by broad geographic features and ecoregions. The Bombus species B. (B.) occidentalis and B. (B.) terricola were relatively abundant in sample sites west and east of the Rocky Mountains, respectively, and B. (Pyrobombus) vagans, B. (Cullumanobombus) rufocinctus, and B. occidentalis were the most abundant species across all sites.",2015
Rearing and foraging affects bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) gut microbiota,,HONEY-BEES; SP NOV.; DIGESTIVE-TRACT; GEN. NOV.; POLLINATORS; SYMBIONTS; ARSENOPHONUS; COMMUNITIES; DECLINES; PLANTS,"Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important as pollinators of crop and wild plants, especially in temperate systems. Species, such as the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), are reared commercially to pollinate high-value crops. Their highly specific gut microbiota, characterized by low diversity, may affect nutrition and immunity and are likely to be important for fitness and colony health. However, little is known about how environmental factors affect bacterial community structure. We analysed the gut microbiota from three groups of worker bumblebees (B.terrestris) from distinct colonies that varied in rearing and foraging characteristics: commercially reared with restricted foraging (RR); commercially reared with outside foraging (RF); and wild-caught workers (W). Contrary to previous studies, which indicate that bacterial communities are highly conserved across workers, we found that RF individuals had an intermediate community structure compared with RR and W types. Further, this was shaped by differences in the abundances of common operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the diversity of rare OTUs present, which we propose results from an increase in the variety of carbohydrates obtained through foraging.",2015
Identifying essential ecological factors underpinning the development of a conservation plan for the Endangered Australian tree Alectryon ramiflorus,Conservation plan; dioecious; essential ecological factors; fragmentation; frugivory; microphyll; pollination; translocation,COVER,"Reintroduction of rare and threatened species often fails to yield quantifiable conservation benefits because insufficient attention is focused on the species' habitat requirements and biology. We demonstrate the value of such data in informing a recovery plan for Alectryon ramiflorus S.Reyn. (Sapindaceae), a tree species endemic to a region on the southern coast of Queensland, Australia. When the species was categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 1997 the total known population consisted of only 26 adult plants, in five disjunct populations in remnant patches of native vegetation. Analysis of vegetation type, soil chemistry and composition data comparing remnant patches with and without A. ramiflorus revealed that the species is not restricted to a specific soil type but prefers sites with relatively fertile soil and a more complex vegetation structure. The species is cryptically dioecious, displays asynchronous flowering between individuals, and requires insect-vectored pollination. The low rate of seedling production recorded within individual patches was attributed to the scarcity of trees of both genders, asynchronous flowering of individual trees and, in smaller patches, a sparse population of pollinating insect species. Successful reintroduction of A. ramiflorus will require consideration of these aspects of demographic success. The findings highlight the importance to species recovery plans of the knowledge of habitat requirements, interspecific relationships and critical dependencies, as well as species reproductive biology.",2015

Among-population pollen movement and skewed male fitness in a dioecious weed,Immigrant pollen; Mating patterns; Microsatellite; Paternity exclusion; Pollination distance; Polyploid,PATERNITY ANALYSIS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; PARENTAGE ANALYSIS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SOUTH-AFRICA; TREE; FLOW; DISPERSAL; FOREST; PLANT,Dioecious plant species are presented with the challenge of needing both males and females to be present to ensure seed production and self-sustaining populations. In this situation the contribution of pollen from outside sources to mating events may become reproductively important. Salix cinerea (willow) is used as an ecological model for investigating the importance of inter-population pollen movement for the local reproductive dynamics of a dioecious environmental weed using microsatellite-based paternity analysis. Nearly 40 % of seeds produced are sired by fathers from outside the local site (500 m) indicating that invasive S. cinerea populations are linked through pollen movement. Thus in the absence of males at a site up to 40 % of seed production would be maintained by immigrant pollen. Observed patterns of within-site mating dynamics revealed a highly skewed male fitness distribution with a small number of fathers being responsible for a large proportion of successful fertilisation events. High inter-population pollen flow for this dioecious weed suggests that between population reproductive dynamics may increase the likelihood of colonisation success of dioecious weeds. Control strategies that take into account inter-population pollen dispersal need to be developed for effective management.,2015

Studies of floral structures can contribute to our knowledge of the evolutionary diversification of this genus and ecological aspects of its species as well as assist management and domestication programs. With the objective of characterizing the morphoanatomy of the flowers of A. aculeata, 20 inflorescences were collected in each of three natural populations growing in the northern region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Flowers at anthesis were evaluated biometrically and using standard plant anatomical procedures, and observed under light and scanning electron microscopy. The flowers showed wide biometric variability that was influenced by the collection area, the individuals examined, and the positions of the flowers on the inflorescence. Staminate flowers can have two whorls of petals, small anthers, and vestigial structures, with the development of an infertile carpel and rudimentary ovules. Defenses against herbivory include the presence of raphides in the anthers and pistillate flowers, fiber bundles, stegmata, and idioblasts containing phenols and raphides. Pollinators are attracted by the liberation of intense odors produced by osmophores located in the corolla, with pollen being the principal resource offered. Phenotypic plasticity, the structures involved in defending against herbivores and attracting pollinators, the numbers of flowers, and flowering synchrony contribute to the reproductive success of this species. The short period during which the stigmas remain receptive determines synchronous fertilization within the inflorescence.",2015
Difference in flowering time can initiate speciation of nocturnally flowering species,Reproductive isolation; Flowering time; Magic trait; Theoretical study,DAYLILY HEMEROCALLIS-FULVA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; ADAPTIVE-DYNAMICS; CITRINA; POLLEN; EVOLUTION; SELECTION,"Isolation mechanisms that prevent gene flow between populations prezygotically play important roles in achieving speciation. In flowering plants, the nighttime flowering system provides a mechanism for isolation from diurnally flowering species. Although this system has long been of interest in evolutionary biology, the evolutionary process leading to this system has yet to be elucidated because of the lack of good model species. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the differences in flowering times and the traits that attract pollinators between a pair of diurnally and nocturnally flowering species have recently been identified in a few cases. This identification enables us to build a realistic model for theoretically studying the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species. In this study, based on previous experimental data, we assumed a model in which two loci control the flowering time and one locus determines a trait that attracts pollinators. Using this model, we evaluated the possibility of the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering ancestor through simulations. We found that a newly emerging nighttime flowering flower exhibited a sufficiently high fitness, and the evolution of a nocturnally flowering species from a diurnally flowering species could be achieved when hybrid viability was intermediate to low, even in a completely sympatric situation. Our results suggest that the difference in flowering time can act as a magic trait that induces both natural selection and assortative mating and would play an important role in speciation between diurnally and nocturnally flowering species pairs.

INTERACTION INTIMACY OF PATHOGENS AND HERBIVORES WITH THEIR HOST PLANTS INFLUENCES THE TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS IN DIFFERENT WAYS,consumer-resource interactions; food webs; Heliconiaceae; multitrophic networks; modularity; nestedness; plant-herbivore; plant-pathogen,ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; FOOD-WEB; COMMUNITIES; SPECIALIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; POPULATIONS; POLLINATION; ASYMMETRIES; NESTEDNESS; MODULARITY,"Premise of the study: Over the past two decades an interest in the role that plant-animal mutualistic networks play in the organization and dynamic of biodiversity has steadily risen. Despite the ecological, evolutionary, and economic importance of plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen antagonistic relationships, however, few studies have examined these interactions in an ecological network framework. Methods: We describe for the first time the topological structure of multitrophic networks involving congeneric tropical plant species of the genus Heliconia (Heliconiaceae, Zingiberales) and their herbivores and pathogens in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. We based our study on the available literature describing the organisms (e.g., insects, mites, fungi, and bacteria) that attack 24 different species, hybrids, and cultivated varieties of Heliconia. Key results: In general, pathogen-and herbivore-Heliconia networks differed in their topological structure (more modular vs. more nested, respectively): pathogen-Heliconia networks were more specialized and compartmentalized than herbivore-Heliconia networks. High modularity was likely due to the high intimacy that pathogens have with their host plants as compared with the more generalized feeding modes and behavior of herbivores. Some clusters clearly reflected the clustering of closely related cultivated varieties of Heliconia sharing the same pathogens. Conclusions: From a commercial standpoint, different varieties of the same Heliconia species may be more susceptible to being attacked by the same species of pathogens. In summary, our study highlights the importance of interaction intimacy in structuring trophic relationships between plants and pathogens in the tropics.",2015
Revisions in the South American Calandrinia caespitosa complex (Montiaceae),Argentina; Chile; distribution; new species; pollination; self-pollination; taxonomy,DNA EVIDENCE; PORTULACACEAE; POLLINATION; MORPHOLOGY; ECOLOGY,"Calandrinia caespitosa is one of seven species currently recognized in Calandrina sect. Acaules. It has been interpreted by all recent studies to represent a single species with variable flower colours. It is here shown that, on the contrary, this entity is a complex which includes four distinct species. Calandrinia caespitosa inhabits depressions at elevations between 2500 and 4000 m in the Andes mountains between 29 degrees S and 36 degrees S. It is morphologically characterized in having 6-8 ellipsoid, flamboyant red petaloids, yellowish-green towards the base. Its typification is discussed, while the synonyms C. diffusa and C. densiflora are neotypified on specimens preserved at K. C. skottsbergii grows in dry, gravelly mountains in central Patagonia from ca. 38-47 degrees S. It has 6-12 petaloids which are truncate and longer and broader than those of Calandrinia caespitosa, orange or rarely yellow, and capsules much larger than those of Calandrinia caespitosa. A deviating species pair occurs in southern Patagonia: C. fuegiana with white or pinkish petaloids and C. ranunculina with yellow petaloids. The latter species is described in this study as new to science. Both C. fuegiana and C. ranunculina share a rather small, weakly zygomorphic perianth with 2+4 petaloids which open for a short period, and then close to allow for self-pollination when the anthers move towards the stigma. This is interpreted here as an adaptation to the very strong winds prevailing in their habitats. C. fuegiana grows in screes and snow beds in the high mountains from 47 degrees S to near 52 degrees S, in addition to an isolated distribution area further south in the mountains near Lago Fagnano in Tierra del Fuego at c. 54 degrees 30' S. Its capsules are large and similar to those of C. skottsbergii, except that they curve distinctly when mature. C. ranunculina, on the other hand, has adapted to the lowland steppes of southern Patagonia (49 degrees to 54 degrees S), and has very distinct, short and urn-shaped capsules with strongly recurving valves. No hybrids between these species have been detected where any of them meet. A distribution map and a table including comparison of 30 characters between the species are also presented, as well as SEM images of seeds, which also differ morphologically between the species.",2015
Adding ecology to particle capture models: Numerical simulations of capture on a moving cylinder in crossflow,Fluid-structure interaction; Computational fluid dynamics; Abiotic pollination; Suspension feeding; Particle deposition,WIND POLLINATION; CIRCULAR-CYLINDER; LOW MASS; DYNAMICS; PLANTS; EFFICIENCY; ACCUMULATION; AERODYNAMICS; MECHANISMS; CANOPY,"The particle capture efficiency, eta, of systems that remove suspended particles from ambient flow (e.g. suspension feeding, abiotic pollination) has been studied using static collectors in steady flows. Particle deposition on collectors moving due to fluid flow remains largely unknown, despite its ecological relevance. We used numerical modeling to simulate particle deposition on a 2D circular cylinder subject to flow-induced oscillation in a cross flow. Using parameter values relevant to wind pollination and other natural biological systems, we examined the influence of the direction, amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, the Stokes number (Stk=0.01-5, characterizing particle behavior), as well as the Reynolds number (Re=662 and 3309, characterizing flow regime) in steady and unsteady flow, on 71. The numerical model was validated with empirical results for parts of the parameter space. Particle capture occurred via ""inertial impaction"", ""direct interception"" and ""leeward deposition"", as well as via a new mechanism, ""collector chasing"" for moving collectors. The eta of an oscillating cylinder varied significantly relative to a static cylinder, depending on the parameters used, and on the magnitude of a numerical error that caused loss of particles. This variance of eta was due to a change in relative momentum between the particle and the moving collector, which depends on Re, Stk and the oscillation parameters. Collector oscillation transverse to oncoming flow direction strongly increased eta, whereas collector motion parallel to flow had little effect on capture efficiency. The oscillation also changed leeward capture significantly in some cases. For most conditions, however, leeward deposition was small. Results suggest that collector motion could have significant influence on the particle capture efficiency of natural systems, which indicates the need to incorporate these ecologically more relevant findings into current models. Empirical studies, however, are still necessary to validate these results and provide reliable data. ",2015

The origin of the 6x cytotype from a 4x cytotype is demonstrated through fertilization of an unreduced egg cell with a reduced male gamete (B-III hybridization), yielding experimental evidence of uncoupling of apomixis components in P. orientate. This 6x cytotype was compared for its morphological, cytological and reproductive traits vis-a-vis parental 4x cytotype, and also for potential of gene transfer in otherwise apomictic P. orientate.",2015

Mutualistic interactions are beneficial for the two sets of species involved. Network robustness has been usually measured in terms of extinction sequences, i.e., nodes are removed from the empirical bipartite network one subset (primary extinctions) and the number of extinctions on the other subset (secondary extinction) is computed. This is a first approach to study ecosystems extinction. However, each interacting species, depicted as a node of the mutualistic network, is really composed by certain number of individuals (population) and its shortage can diminish dramatically the population of its interacting partners, i.e. the population dynamics plays an important role in the robustness of the ecological networks. Although different models of population dynamics for mutualistic interacting species have been addressed, like Type II models, only recently a new mutualistic model has been proposed exhibiting bounded solutions and good properties for simulation. In this paper we show that population dynamics is as important as network topology when we are interested in the resilience of the community.",2015

This is the case with Ficus microcarpa, which is native to the Philippines but invasive in some parts of the world. The fig wasp community of F. microcarpa in the Philippines can be used as a means of curbing this invasiveness and we aimed to describe this community. In the University of the Philippines Diliman campus, the wasp community was composed of three fig wasp species: the pollinator Eupristina verticillata and two non-pollinator species: a non-primary galler, Sycoryctes moneres and a seed predator, Philotrypesis taiwanensis. Using sticky traps, we showed that F. microcarpa figs are receptive to pollinators for only 1-2 d. The non-pollinating S. moneres and P. taiwanensis wasps arrived 7-10 d after the peak arrival of pollinators. This is the first documentation of the arrival time of a fig wasp seed predator. Through wasp introduction experiments, we were also able to characterize the trophic structure of this community. Nonetheless, the presence of S. moneres did not lead to a significant decrease in pollinator numbers. Introduction of this species to sites with invasive F. microcarpa trees may therefore not be an effective biocontrol method.",2015

Mode of reproduction is ecologically important because it can influence the spread and distribution of plant populations through factors like offspring dispersal distance and establishment success. The two experiments described here address the potential effects of damage and pollen receipt on plant growth, sexual reproduction, and asexual reproduction in a clonal flowering plant (Eichhornia crassipes, water hyacinth). These experiments were conducted in greenhouse and outdoor tanks at the Florida State University research facilities in Tallahassee, FL, on plants collected from north Florida populations. Plants received manual damage to leaves (imposing a loss of resources), apical meristems (imposing a loss of leaf and flower production), or axillary meristems (imposing a loss of clone production). Apical meristem damage increased asexual reproduction (clone number). When severe, axillary meristem damage increased plant growth (leaf production). Neither leaf damage nor pollination affected plant growth, clone production, or flower production. Asexual reproductive responses to damage have not been well studied, although sexual reproduction and individual plant growth have been shown to increase following damage. These results have implications for the dispersal and establishment of clonal plants in the presence of herbivory. For a highly invasive species like E. crassipes, these results can further inform the use of insect herbivores to manage invasive populations.",2015

These result from alterations in the structure and patterns of interaction of the ecosystem, often with negative consequences in terms of losses of ecosystem function and the extinction of species. As a result, establishing protected areas as Brazil's Extractive Reserves (Resex) is a necessity. Ecological networks can be used as a tool to assess whether the Resex are effective in conserving marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of fishers. By analysing the structure of networks, e.g., their nestedness and modularity, it is possible to understand how species interact with each other, both directly and indirectly. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the interactions and the management activities affecting fishers and fish at the Canavieiras Resex. The data were collected between April and August 2012 through semi-structured interviews with fishers to identify their target species and the fishing gear that they use to identify the structural patterns of the fish-fisherman, fish-guilds, and functional-group-guilds networks. The target species were Centropomus spp., Lutjanus jocu, Eugerres brasilianus and Mugil spp. Cast nets and trammel nets were the types of fishing gear that were most frequently used. High nestedness and significative modularity patterns were observed in the networks, indicating that generalist and specialist fishers primarily capture their target species. These patterns also indicate the extent of harvesting pressure on these fish. The fishers who use these networks include a high level of fish biodiversity in their catches. The structural pattern that was found implied that fishing pressure on these species, coupled with a lack of management tools, has created a situation in which priority must be given to the development of scientific conservation techniques and sustainable management plans.",2015

In this study, we examined pollen and resource limitation by comparing fruit set and seed production in natural-and hand-pollinated Hedysarum scoparium flowers in the middle reaches of the Hexi Corridor region, China, in 2010. We also described a role for the first substantial autumn rainfall in mediating a shift between pollen and resource limitation in H. scoparium, but did not analyze this experimentally. Our results indicated that H. scoparium was resource limited at peak flowering during the summer, and was pollen limited at peak flowering during the autumn. The seasonal change (summer to autumn) mediated the shift between pollen and resource limitations in H. scoparium. The shift timing depended on the date of the first autumn rainfall in 2010. Changes in the first substantial rainfall in autumn may affect fruiting of H. scoparium, thus affecting population persistence of this species and development/structure of the local ecosystem if such conditions persist.",2015

Colored sticky traps could be a simple and a low-cost method for determining the relative abundance of harmful and beneficial insects, including pollinators. However, knowledge about catches of nontargeted insects such as pollinators by colored traps is rudimentary. Trials were conducted to evaluate the attractiveness of various colors (white, yellow, blue, and green) to some pollinating insects in apple in Adana Province, Turkey, during 2011 and 2012. Colored plates were hung at about 1.70 m from ground level of the exterior canopy of the selected trees at the beginning of their blooming and they were positioned toward the 4 cardinal directions. A total of 7 insect species belonging to the families Syrphidae (6 species, Diptera) and Apidae (1 species, Hymenoptera) were identified. Pollinating hoverfly Eristalis tenax L. and honey bee Apis mellifera L. were frequently captured, and significantly more of them were captured on white traps (P < 0.05). Blue and green colored traps were less attractive to both pollinator species. Cardinal directions did not have a significant effect on catches of E. tenax and A. mellifera on white traps. The use of white sticky traps may provide more ecological data for pollinators. However, using white colored traps for mass trapping of harmful insect species in fruit orchards may be risky due to reducing their numbers, particularly during blooming periods of the fruit orchards. Arrangements of sticky trap use prior to peak occurrence of the pollinators would be a better approach in terms of conservation of pollinators and sustainability of ecosystems.",2015

Its species present a variety of different mating system strategies varying within and among species, within genera and subfamilies. Also, species with a wide geographical range can display large variation in mating system, reproductive success and genetic diversity. Here we combined data from hand pollinations and genetic analysis to assess outcomes of contemporary gene flow and mating system variation at the range edge of Vriesea gigantea. Results from pollen germination rates showed that this species is cryptically self-incompatible. Hand-pollination experiments and genetic analysis of progeny arrays revealed that V. gigantea has a mixed mating system, with high selling rates (s = 0.612), and high inbreeding coefficient (F= 0.372). Inbreeding in V. gigantea at southern edge of its distribution range was caused by high levels of selfing rather than by mating among relatives. Moreover, strong pollen pool genetic structure was observed (Phi'(FT) = 0.671), with an increase from north to south. The parameters observed help us to understand historical and ecological conditions under which V. gigantea has experienced moderate to high levels of selfing in the face of reduced pollen flow from central to peripheral populations due to recent southward range expansion.

This species is rare in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and vulnerable in Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia. In a two-year study we examined several aspects of the reproductive ecology of M. patula at five populations in northeastern Illinois. We used a combination of field-based studies (i.e., fruit set and seed set, breeding system, population size estimation), field observations (i.e., phenology), laboratory studies (i.e., seed germination, pollen: ovule ratio, floral morphometrics) and historical data (i.e., population size and weather data) to answer several questions: (1) What can data on the reproductive ecology of M. patula tell us about the species?; (2) Are there differences in reproductive output among populations of M. patula?; and (3) Can variation in the population size of M. patula be related to reproductive output and/ or local weather patterns? Based on caging studies, flower phenology, and pollen to ovule ratio, M. patula can be considered a facultative autogamous species. Also, although significant differences were found among populations of M. patula for fruit set, seed set, and seed germination, fruit set was relatively high (above 60%), but seed set and seed germination were relatively low (less than 50%) regardless of the population. No correlation was found between population size and reproductive output or local weather data. The results of this study can be used to develop a conservation strategy for M. patula across its range in the U.S.",2015
"Pollen flow of wheat under natural conditions in the Huanghuai River Wheat Region, China",wheat pollen; pollen suspension velocity; pollen flow; pollen dispersal; spatial isolation,MEDIATED GENE FLOW; LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; CROSS-POLLINATION; SPRING WHEAT; WIND; ENVIRONMENT; ECOLOGY; MODELS; PLANTS; MAIZE,"The transgenic pollen spread is the main pathway of transgenic plant gene flow. The maximum distance of pollen dispersal (horizontal), the spatial dynamics of pollen movement (vertical), and the patterns of pollen dispersal are important considerations in biosafety assessments of genetically modified crops. To evaluate wheat (Triticum aestivum) pollen dispersal, we measured the pollen suspension velocity and analyzed pollen dispersal patterns under natural conditions in the Huanghuai River wheat-growing region in 2009. The pollen suspension velocity was 0.3-0.4 m/s. The highest pollen densities were detected in the north, northwest, and south of the pollen source. Pollen was dispersed over distances greater than 245 m in the northwest and northeast directions. At the pollen source center, pollen density decreased with increasing vertical height. In the north of the pollen source, the pollen density from 65 m to 225 m showed a wave-mode decrease with increasing height. The horizontal transport of pollen over longer distances fitted polynomial equations. In the north, the pollen density was highest at 45 m from the pollen source, and decreased with increasing distance. In the northwest, the pollen density showed a double-peak trend. In the northeast, pollen density was highest from 45 m to 125 m from the source. Wind speeds greater than the pollen suspension velocity and the duration of continuous gusts were the main factors affecting pollen dispersal. This information will be useful for determining the spatial isolation distances for hybrid seed production and for the commercial production of transgenic wheat.",2015
Antifungal Properties of Extracts of Sesame (Sesamum indicum),Sesame; Antifungal; Fusarium oxysporum; Alaternaria sesame; Macrophomona phaseolina,COMMON PATHOGENIC MICROORGANISMS; GENETIC-RELATIONSHIP; ROOTS; L.; NAPHTHOQUINONE; DIVERSITY; AFLP,"Plant secondary metabolites have important ecological function not only as attractant for pollinators and seed dispersing animals but also as resistance factor against pests and pathogens. Accessions that produce high levels of metabolites involved in resistance are valuable source for sesame breeding. With the aim of identifying genotypes with high content of metabolites potentially involved in resistance against fungal pathogens, 32 sesame accessions were investigated. Metabolites were extracted from leaves, stems and roots and tested against plant pathogenic fungi Macrophomina phaseolina, Alternaria sesami and Fusarium oxysporum. Extracts obtained with 80% ethanol were assayed in microtiter plates and changes in the optical density of the growing fungal cultures were recorded at 550 nm. Most of the extracts had inhibitory effect on all the tested fungal species. Some of the root extracts supported the growth of A. sesami whereas some leaf extracts enhanced the growth of F. oxysporum as compared to the control. The variations observed amongst different sesame accessions lead to the assumption that there is potential to improve plant disease resistance in sesame using metabolic pathway engineering. Crude ethanol extracts of one the accession UCLA1 was fractionated with organic solvents. The inhibition effects of diethylether, chloroform and hexane fractions were higher than of ethanol fraction remaining after extraction with the other solvents. To test whether the synthesis of antifungal metabolites was inducible, plants were exposed to UV light, inoculation with M. phaseolina or F. oxysporum or spraying with CuCl2. The extract of the plants sprayed with CuCl2 were the most inhibitory against M. phaseolina and F. oxysporum in case of leaves extract and against F. oxysporum in case of stem extract. ",2015
Conservation biology of two endemic Beyeria species (Euphorbiaceae) from southern Western Australia,endemism; endangered plants; phenology; pollination; reproductive biology; seed ecology,DISPERSAL REPRODUCTIVE LOSSES; SEED-GERMINATION; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; THREATENED PLANTS; BREEDING SYSTEM; LIFE-HISTORY; SHRUB; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; VEGETATION,"Beyeria cockertonii Halford & R.J.F. Hend. and Beyeria villosa Halford & R.J.F. Hend. (Euphorbiaceae) are two short-range endemic monoecious congeners from southern Western Australia. We sought to determine whether life-history characteristics were responsible for their limited distribution and to identify aspects of their ecology that might render them vulnerable to current threatening processes. We investigated reproductive phenology in relation to climate, pollinator activity and synchronicity of male and female flowering. In addition seed dispersal, regeneration, demography and seed viability were examined and ex situ germination experiments conducted to determine seed-dormancy mechanisms. Flowering in the conservation-listed B. cockertonii was significantly correlated with temperature, whereas fruit set was correlated with pollinator abundance and movement; male and female flowering showed limited synchrony. The presence of soil-stored seeds lacking a caruncle at sites absent of adult plants of either species suggests that seed may be ant-dispersed (myrmecochory). Fresh seeds of B. cockertonii were significantly more viable than those of its more common congener, B. villosa (72 vs 0.5%, P < 0.001). Fresh B. cockertonii seeds would not germinate with an intact caruncle; caruncle removal elicited germination of 64% and 60% (10 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively). Aqueous smoke further stimulated germination to 72% and 83% germination (10 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively), providing a link between fire and germination. Beyeria villosa was affected by high levels of pre-dispersal predation (up to 70%) and seed abortion (88%) and appeared to have lower reproductive fitness than B. cockertonii. Life-history strategies did not explain the greater abundance and wider distribution of B. villosa than those of the conservation-listed B cockertonii, nor was the greater rarity of B. cockertonii fully explained by habitat specificity, with both species being restricted to ultra-mafic volcanic rock associated with Achaean greenstone. However, an apparent dependence of B. cockertonii on a specific insect pollinator from the family Miridae may render this species vulnerable to threatening processes.",2015
